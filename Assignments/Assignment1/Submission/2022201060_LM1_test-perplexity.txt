Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage

Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,

Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	736.4230369149111
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."
	750.0944412011168
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	377.36111177109274
"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	576.7075108372336
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	632.5750898483476

feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	717.4658547487602
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from

_that_."

Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	471.65279440180313
But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"
	519.5076157615388
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley.	605.0483995064344
She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	693.6117214666141
as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	622.9904804719916
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	540.8318159501047
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."
	656.2443250639873
Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	830.3664300553601
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	758.4920396400008
informing her of their intention.	894.7760819845063
"You are over scrupulous surely.	758.9927680419709

Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"
	518.2513153545179
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully.	674.0233696494164
"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	625.2609331920307
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	574.0657690310627

To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	566.5928694573539
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."

talking of?	456.0643317728978

seem so wholly unexpected.	739.2741121773591
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	648.9022710984949
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
	405.61657619822654
This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	613.764314440533
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."

it.	597.3141605146315

He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	578.5924020159332
"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	663.6155775750773

"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	707.0999471481183
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,

"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to

speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	644.4227354190433

It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.	597.2582069399996
His choice is disinterested at least,
	614.9068796324559
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	618.9431725688233

disposition, Lizzy.	643.3861298029659

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."
	751.6190335541901
They were all astonished; and Mr.	679.695941388542
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it.	603.8564286949895
Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	632.5973390108538
Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	725.3977563110714
But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	666.8700841006975
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	462.88874902013237
He has the
	679.7607804495699
believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
	623.8327898280866
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	792.0274679840559
I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
	564.0004504028294
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	811.44343483794
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	590.3912597329262
To Mr.	592.3640888758189
As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	666.7802997570085
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	766.8333945112666
Why must their
marriage be private?	780.1446690017616
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."
	580.1598628600601
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr.	700.8071098677997
However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr.	709.2500835214431
Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.	681.2029636895656
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	701.5241490125564
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."
	494.1909271225294
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr.	666.5234051646024
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.	616.9656718178782
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr.	517.7484280934793
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	747.1022312209769
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"
	606.7347105525411
"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	795.5341132068606
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	560.6368442229079
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."
	512.0212943676121
Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	457.7763144177136
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	774.5732517022716
Bennet followed her,
saying,
	728.2290060101282
Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	736.92309450304
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.	536.1734923643937
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr.	747.5729380838217
It was all conjecture."
	728.1366942535952
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	533.0110532353209
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	643.9520587817027
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	514.7590088258592
Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.	597.942784258851
"MY DEAR LIZZY,
	592.3640888758189
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley.	547.7841674553366
In
understanding Darcy was the superior.	679.6384539757803
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
	604.2407080226018
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."
	697.5266561739762
It mortifies me.	679.8195901065612
Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	795.6794985640053
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	816.7545189158712
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	642.8028494920371
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	619.9029131302411
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	741.6873392350369
At present I will
say nothing about it."
	435.18226200150656
it out, but I hardly know what I have written."
	623.0015113084033
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	634.2907190740718
We want none of them;
do we?"
	673.7449535097263
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	701.8880784205793
We will go round the Park every day.	553.8396398008072
She smiled, but made no answer.	362.1155130886553
"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."
	670.5143512866381
was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	895.2310137053497
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	797.4247463179634
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	795.6352584127677
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	511.13530345464477
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	597.4692833068381
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.	770.1825774621929
Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	643.4533190082893
- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
	585.1129682029374
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings.	565.7463591035247
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs.	378.6967812928294
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."
	571.1234686939516
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	608.6647471271109
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	641.1287791309618
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	550.5581610798866
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her?"
	674.1759892903368
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	646.6237739567596
Yes, yes.	592.3640888758189
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St.	539.0074927219123
Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	506.3246539708043
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.	754.3392645386123
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country.	528.6601888834053
Are the others coming out?"
	651.1482473250497
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,
	600.9871098606461
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	731.0188488437468
The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	590.1286127093439
CHAPTER I.	592.3640888758189
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,
	687.9326939130024
That tall, proud man."
	728.2762576714733
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	707.0368703632386
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	608.8455396262403
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	514.2189701864369
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	626.6057544591337
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.	733.6956653356352
herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	693.4260174499525
Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	703.7776493635762
Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	746.6065301161842
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other.	553.1657177344459
Transcriber's note:
	526.6237852241783
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	615.1212421435278
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	729.766821891334
Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	608.9197875625545
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	694.1982675154288
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	661.7018377368304
They will
ruin your happiness.	651.1894398435409
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr.	715.6500084347531
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr.	451.595869914818
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	619.3480267199427
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."
	478.6804947436658
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.	707.1291883133791
gave them to understand that they were going to
	385.2789751712389
But at last your uncle was forced
	795.6112848776223
"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"
	600.4357653790166
I do not know who is
good enough for him."
	383.6568875301134
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
	598.6758936917479
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	517.027981482361
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	526.816972221317
It was really a very
handsome thought.	572.7771299443406
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	722.3209846869465
a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	594.0429702436202
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	673.7907516530939
"Are you not diverted?"
	728.2194250684365
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.	547.4834050849815
But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs.	622.5054698412902
than yourself, or Jane at most.	728.2605082514217
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
	435.7467812362153
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."
	470.6380007416041
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	608.6837299405448
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
	742.0372512089618
I am the happiest creature in
	604.3588558678537
_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.	770.9174595210757
Then turning to Mr.	592.3640888758189
The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	793.7783445794064
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness.	697.5557996590758
Hurst's gown----"
	679.8195901065612
To Mr.	592.3640888758189
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"
	526.4739477512736
All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	720.5447690795897
Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	786.1838780088259
"One of them does."
	728.2284563128468
The path just admitted three.	758.9927680419709
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	461.8265604002386
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	665.7376771576278
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."
	714.5711200209955
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs.	561.0980088122557
This Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House.	601.039266679065
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	501.11970607151346
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.	596.4985699603385
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
next Saturday."
	493.69374647900185
I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	616.498496896268
You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	720.7923494411665
Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	676.5570077012402
"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	487.56145875890064
Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.	601.1423680599878
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	709.6964347590583
She was very wrong in singling me out as
	816.6766453679271
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	450.8910144530506
Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	651.4914622597249
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	681.5152573060446
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."
	752.0487209168568
Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr.	648.0572798813027
"Oh, Jane,
take care."
	656.800814290339
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	770.5680022563901
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	636.9928573276666
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,

"No--why should he?	728.2571011178707
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	584.3282797880822
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	487.5470055042215
Our poor mother
	526.6237852241783
could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other

Pemberley.	769.6626138474638
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way.	710.2889686359159

On
Mr.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	543.5625967322987

They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	485.5564052997389
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.	633.804247095998
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	707.9777784891075
"To-morrow fortnight."
	679.8195901065612
After this period, every

your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	392.1158698162934
Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	659.8568775041541

life, one hundred pounds per annum.	788.0472951321226
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	763.4723582719419
To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	807.4874459219186
The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	678.1647974079566
He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	695.6719453336901
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"
	559.1921053741379
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.	758.9641535461791
"And quite alone?	679.8048892796321
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.	728.1771383047623
They battled it
	679.8195901065612
CHAPTER XVIII.	592.3640888758189
She cared for none
	728.240822508087
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.	728.0690040817092
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	673.8045255377025
On both sides it was only assertion.	649.3664175764097
"And I have another favour to ask.	611.680244171771
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.	546.3587303989897
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	636.281844743262
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	643.377781986115
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	782.6918455970521
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs.	518.7785550992515
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	761.7845522427107
If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
	779.6385982864595
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him."
	554.8672669174389
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
	725.4768679626281
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself."
	669.4373277985827
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."
	634.6950613049935
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	595.7942298523596
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	614.9416248229913
My
father, however, is partial to Mr.	633.804247095998
"Most willingly."
	592.3640888758189
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."
	738.3393293341563
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
	621.728524145862
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	528.5891269025852
***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE***
	592.3640888758189
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."
	749.4748104394023
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	742.1389380194412
My sisters may write to _me_.	780.1193549749576
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."
	573.16854676884
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	561.4207449504654
Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr.	728.2028126161545
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	627.8657781541376
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	812.4669413551003
"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	537.0370853238999
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,
	675.8535686379493
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
impossible.	614.3153523964238
Collins's admiration.	526.6351722320229
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	515.9663429468396
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"
	601.4572619420422
This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."
	396.9178479630069
There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs.	675.8759727543545
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."
	671.9606191275902
But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	733.0785569316542
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	651.1340940023606
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	595.9780038287148
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	705.5375623281884
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	545.0586417181419
Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	628.6803186345854
Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.	602.2411537843299
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	630.9139300914915
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	673.0848502375433
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	652.1013425849665
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs.	540.7728901372512
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	611.759616253368
obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
	739.1655339646721
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	346.118616938509
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	582.4209824375812
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley.	744.9886204310892
And she was only sixteen last June.	576.5798776406382
"Not as you represent it.	758.9355516734797
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr.	613.4078502594951
It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	645.6612045427858
You shall hear what she says."
	604.4397681619613
as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
	647.217872909045
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."
	578.9722291774146
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."
	696.8408976332825
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	660.2894122873474
done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
	895.2580965985509
And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	824.3852220025851
The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	647.1497284285929
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	666.2145075522715
Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.	660.0586356188497
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."
	631.2697059855045
Darcy.--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of

	700.622718600342
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	582.7103387744725
Darcy by
character perfectly well.	758.9730716644875
Do not distress me by the idea.	541.0721511263483
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	669.1795133191227
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"
	648.519228565063
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
	649.3316749812581
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	852.5746809471727
Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--
	424.572421186367
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	707.0735662148139
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	609.9518147770788
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	658.7967568969846
His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."
	841.9814105009962
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget.	745.1018297300042
Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	633.4282507930175
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	586.7099352244918
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	600.8570428337466

His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	671.5533083951495
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.	603.6983369004605
I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
	784.0137214322019
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."
	750.6213097450985
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	699.4168597651544
It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	616.9014046434006
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr.	361.0687205504661
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
	745.0669680526594
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.	670.2268623955861
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	597.4699177512931
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it?	568.8384114961909
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family.	795.6965429428367
It is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!"
	750.3552253184503
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.	670.1120344492068
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
	660.4647915798362
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
	669.3372908397745
"And you saw him frequently?"
	758.8370079619344
The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	732.9829519769229
His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time.	733.0683577786111
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,
	562.9285640420848
She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.	710.7285610014075
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."
	758.3809197271881
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	646.7335840688347
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	617.7206599838071
It
was all pride and insolence.	780.0753402797176
strong inducement.	895.3721494065021
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.	610.7555819243751
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	705.7846098443769
You take
delight in vexing me.	780.1615452116428
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	798.2076284577971
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	807.4006905636807
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	815.2253035647298
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."
	566.0986837798471
- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
	772.8211364847608
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."
	810.5294475599062
Not all that Mrs.	592.3640888758189

The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do."
	564.8783120010779
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	475.69555213189216
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart.	663.1295213841732
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.	679.7780687969971
She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	722.5959387253951
letter to Mrs.	679.790187394607
and Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	840.3033473728452
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.	714.7113586403988
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	624.6123885576798
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected.	563.7653756851817
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	321.55332875490416
"What would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.	745.0360507908456
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
	733.9313882672711
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	814.8611715792706
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."
	432.8290989836559
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	410.6740511866962
Though Mr.	592.3640888758189
You must require such a user to return or
	816.4933855537134
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	819.4789814561055
Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs.	679.7474491907178
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
	654.035082639936
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	711.6020658457018
"Ah! sir, I do indeed.	643.377781986115
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	624.0800801717802
Did she call to refuse her consent?"
	795.6573749289961
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	618.1219872211794
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	705.7635779095034
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	719.4729048044222
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"
	604.8347905890815
I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	668.8448727221588
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."
	795.6794985640053
You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."
	683.499344689792
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	509.57668143403896
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."
	779.2211990503017
Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	458.3068636924733
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr.	669.6675494548343
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"
	494.3820798954281
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror.	663.7726019500984
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	637.8430999643077
Where shall you change
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to."
	554.2220190567404
Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.	520.9264920458476
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
	686.6401305278682
Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	704.564385105968
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without."
	676.5285596954661
Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw.	256.87383836793805
whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
	717.1938244793323
"Yes; to the last.	543.4803280194429
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	578.4992465322063
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."
	558.7142775070824
They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."
	655.1577409307553
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	729.6991425138082
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	660.5195926665034
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	552.0237441969767
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	457.02700293579323
"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."
	678.0834196117418
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."
	557.6809826171634
last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a

Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	601.161323565946
It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	561.8705237629174
Collins so before you came.	651.1049463401854
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
	634.5688723193184
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	692.6934721155159
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"
	643.3861298029659
Images of the original pages are available through
	808.0023035812237
Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	767.3434912390442
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	750.0231665580435
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	431.2413486734148
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."
	709.458076548742
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."
	538.2975288182562
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
	490.4889852715681
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"
	816.5312460729784
There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."
	693.4399961095122
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.	688.1637439664423
A Novel.	592.3640888758189
Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	646.5753972581455
"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
	568.7458283883248
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.	654.7623244592642
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	645.9299031306606

and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	756.754372612062
society in town.	495.12244295835245
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."
	536.1005395300961
You know I have.	592.3640888758189
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."
	523.3855632234762
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"
	670.3003215818618
We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune."
	711.6626294639674
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	814.0605060414329
"Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	816.6373440869319
What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr.	670.5246996696958
If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.	571.3179111833335
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.	728.182244395639
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	749.6401199137962
"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his partners.	625.8439287373996
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	651.2864757694823
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.	684.5927324531087
real character.	610.4296196428011
I was
	592.3640888758189
Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	692.3762762161248
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr.	568.1808515217012
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	605.2659875578373
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	674.3107849238447
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's."
	715.2561724822083
I hope they will not meet at all.	453.92736466846236
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.	728.2207063512597
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
	719.5680720441371
It was then disclosed in the following
manner.	606.3055545644887
In a few days Mr.	415.4428828995334
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."
	447.9132291239736
The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	701.0530451007772
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	555.9508951710342
She has known him only a fortnight.	630.9771908931266
Why should they try to influence him?	713.1688734536276
Gardiner could do.	422.4223858824327
You need not.	679.7317791822525
CHAPTER II.	592.3640888758189
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	760.7537460408358
I shall go distracted."
	728.2644461272968
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
	447.9940667070902
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	639.8771393777747
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	686.3933066621935
If Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	613.3453511876656
would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
	768.009312017007
You will be a very happy woman."
	603.4656535184188
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	683.036255252257
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	576.5084834145933
But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	585.4001627931831
"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,
	561.7045742814172
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"
	518.8490572501718
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
	830.4500189713185
And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	631.4871979053793

	745.9857636404157
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr.	691.0013528048025
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	493.18532794969764
His doing so
drew her notice.	686.6688242241098
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	537.1737816930457
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
I hope you will consent to be of the party.	469.70883424243164
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	765.7605043428713
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.	604.57056914165
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	604.0093009737063
Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	752.7195126462134
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."
	622.0886499307911
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	788.3074004327196
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	758.9734930527572
Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."
	666.6327701939244
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	584.9851649231865
"But I was embarrassed."
	656.8140542234568
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	640.3813347932487
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
	895.2925944905438
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
	482.00557663457215
He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	567.3269422680886
part of London they were.	599.4335043440683
Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	347.69944637329303
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that.	619.5210733376343
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
	830.4969259718024
It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	513.893070290173
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	713.0158339285566
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	538.4468243996068
morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
	807.4279511152525
It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	689.4147790702939
But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	575.9197985211149
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	795.5079528285813
We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	678.5571808470918
Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	835.6707804867142
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	654.3757166098754
Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	795.62578905275
is she handsome?"
	895.3572947145975
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	495.95144284954586
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	384.03079088211524
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	700.8457680381664
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.	770.4535220500488
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.	567.8603188257571
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr.	310.6762892795647
Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	562.0525631727417
Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	672.7711329850098
Darcy just deigned to return.	758.9392696283405
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	594.7830785395108
"Is my father in town?"
	531.8941448885154
She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.	610.5678796022128
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	570.2554701927876
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.	638.733181891282
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.	583.9126149947604
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	559.1989179040944
But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	830.1743164449501
CHAPTER XIV.	592.3640888758189
"LYDIA BENNET."
	592.3640888758189
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs.	762.476613328964
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
	780.1663392437139
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
	750.0352311727441
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	573.9947665075658
Oh! here comes Hill.	592.3640888758189
Wickham himself?"
	592.3640888758189
CHAPTER III.	592.3640888758189
attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
	742.0767269203152
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham.	692.4049338957175
Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	674.4287238375878
Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	584.8819684726982
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	712.7101904764398
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	370.22394907921296
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.	655.5305320763405
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.	526.5972093908741
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	676.5691383298209
What am I to do?"
	430.2424761058232
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	498.5237920186754
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
	799.8983396217185
Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	445.8179647005672
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	717.4983518241537
Darcy's proposals.	679.8048892796321
If you should have no objection to receive me
	546.1117384185168
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	441.0230753593821
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	547.6378965321179
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr.	592.3640888758189
He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."
	674.4568977613366
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	719.4893779354084
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	673.6924249427689
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	586.9751079102093
The fee is
	679.8195901065612
It originated in
Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	770.4495467838912
is sadly grieved.	895.3536336873741
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
	692.9358635915395
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.	628.4361880428394
"Very well.	592.3640888758189
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	596.4653470771651
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	780.189971720533
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."
	598.3022974152792
the world.	155.5294052354951
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr.	562.0495720739849
"Who do you mean, my dear?	413.8500527954053
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	581.4536133822277
Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	589.8062775083067
He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	746.7888716038681
The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid.	787.310005714127
breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
	709.7176824870666
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.	499.0387005180759
London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
	577.792333453996
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
	834.9204147650167
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."
	588.6024525355765
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	816.7922689451885
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	689.4430911483723
I always said it must be so, at last.	446.03031325690404
us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	513.531927831194
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	641.0383921118456
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."
	722.8917702870244
my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
	626.2454038495413
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	626.3077369477538
If Elizabeth, when Mr.	592.3640888758189
The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	697.4349405583768
You have delighted us long enough.	686.7211884256213
"No, no.	592.3640888758189
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	577.5025235600508
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	830.5480578376856
He had been some time with Mr.	567.7580935942541
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	759.0112169973577
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth.	692.6722587189719
Stop me whilst you can."
	601.2672679438327
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them.	545.2016608532809
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	612.0116711338748
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	724.614018752102
Chief Executive and Director
	592.3640888758189
and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
	541.6373198289787
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,
	525.1688646606319
"I wish you joy.	496.54697985326743
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
	649.6385358483159
Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"
	723.7039406580308
I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	741.7625663710136
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	567.4701373101196
Bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	795.6735188701508
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
	551.5233009898217
"I wish it may."
	496.55090442810626
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."
	637.3878796335496
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	722.4728756366178
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."
	501.49866931597836
Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.	571.916958557673
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	618.7106685758787
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,
	647.6938190600921
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	738.3532402577496
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
we never should have got into the coach.	665.9305930437382
her side.	894.4125132609487
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."
	854.9598684365418
Bingley is
come.--He is, indeed.	634.5733172634416
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	588.2374362221981
person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
	571.8094477034283
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
	757.4861196687817
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	508.7726586316029
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."
	696.0327681325822
"Come, Mr.	592.3640888758189
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton.	545.738911450093
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	622.1602247334246
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."
	705.3591920237469
kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	802.5235641566854
junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
	582.6996785200142
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	701.8174962793697
To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr.	568.2169257674663
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	639.1430055049249
But think no more of the letter.	304.10610169729836
But you do not know _all_.	313.9843254483757
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	769.9660410101943
Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"
	603.2781860648748
The visit
was returned in due form.	795.6587689332114
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	629.7553418140019
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."
	666.4551993218586
Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	792.7548930583013
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	500.3139164077914
My sister, who is more than ten years my
	605.3451125970371
1.F.5.	592.3640888758189
James's had made him
courteous.	686.5959552746345
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	614.0252527559545
Are
you going much farther?"
	758.9927680419709
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	562.4667709847259
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	758.9730716644875
accede to his proposal.	895.1085322320026
You will hardly blame me for refusing to
	733.6961844859424
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	549.4631538333977
The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	672.8319954641488
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
	709.6184900117213
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	558.0192056947926
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	632.6367634096842
Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."
	529.360295437259
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was

It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr.	457.4093665630407
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	688.9212854160696
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr.	554.7363128724668
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	422.7940901538495

Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs.	745.1734668746203
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."
	708.7636627919288
She dared not relate the other
half of Mr.	745.1029972096579
CHAPTER XII.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."

to offend Mr.	663.764336779627

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together.	695.3000913655658
But that is nothing to us.	445.81022700536874
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	816.8204288416051
He did trace them easily to
	780.1784186270178
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	777.6513690673835
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	661.2375534745469
"What do you mean, Hill?	439.64111381012714
They were not the only objects of Mr.	661.6027671496797
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	601.8270766469753
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me.	725.6115796726502
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."
	724.7391972563934
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	799.6708120317868
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	709.7290380574601
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	585.7270471530056
She went on.	526.5782289965277
Darcy was
	592.3640888758189
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr.	624.6571247176071
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	640.1308740465305
There was no help
for it however.	713.1208212951836
leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a

Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."
	664.6280000893062
All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	824.2888193209653
And I think you will agree with me,

James's?"
	592.3640888758189
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	625.3473964503929
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	582.1814251754596
She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	783.3143599030609
Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."
	685.5468282746035
He
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	716.4656086700741
But are you pleased,
Jane?	551.886566234015
He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	695.6040193390958
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	728.4568539087159
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	717.4897207847425
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it.	440.92756887766564
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
	613.1594635066417
and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would

"What do you mean?"
	338.184557605758
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	507.3426724094038
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	710.2164751248325
"Yes, very different.	679.7341501971866
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	695.8619356116897
pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
	795.534738497445
came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
	630.9875721044504
After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
	628.1421165086325
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.	694.2135227349546
He did not
	422.2662245301083
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."
	448.04794042694954
Darcy only, entered the room.	297.08482704060725
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
	642.0205695489509
not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
	614.0500546949985
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr.	639.2494991825138
"Did Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	449.21220292397936
saw him so affected.	895.0871228076282
I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
	649.9759060677744
Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.	758.9691191221805
"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	561.2241900087556
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	661.9414202334207
"I had much rather go in the coach."
	634.925554775902
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	696.3459116765597
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	648.0916934075528
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	477.1500059166249
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	624.071566565902
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	563.7633003012678
Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.	745.0549194776719
Title: Pride and Prejudice
	592.3640888758189
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	756.8414425481136
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	570.3693094687371
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr.	612.9358385815123
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	744.8219790502053
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	854.9499736497829
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	650.0911946629178
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	612.6891828089164
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"
	751.0808329393283
Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."
	556.3249402255473
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	737.3160627369471
influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
	514.0156812372679
Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	404.1201784792671
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	539.5011912203923
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	847.2153435541935
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
	778.8660980902599
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.	666.6220431906611
[Illustration: Morning Dress.	592.3640888758189
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."
	505.11046180787366
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	702.265320973874
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?" said her aunt.	598.8213038624182
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
	718.3907881757218

It is useless to talk of it."
	412.98516655192043
&c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	625.6231909179045
But Mr.	592.3640888758189
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."
	766.8271737918453
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr.	660.7968806565857
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	630.7726375447593
In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."
	682.9718440071022
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	830.4272435137854
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	557.822411291702
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."
	454.7154771767611
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs.	679.8136296301371
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	584.1680577962434
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	684.3238933507728
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again.	699.5495421260658
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.	719.7358226390726
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done.	446.6017386005693

	807.7839732309425
"You judge very properly," said Mr.	679.8195901065612
His words
seemed to imply it.	780.0449503087934
Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	608.3276771150734
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning.	487.2436522094749
Darcy made no answer.	230.29419607648816
His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	659.2743719161782
kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	835.0563760795388
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day."
	648.4732149834773
You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	575.3277534239453
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."
	746.5729643933875
amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
	499.2998287017919
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr.	546.595337095064
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
	731.3800645835116
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	663.0001012131313
defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
	829.2757923076806
"Your's, &c."
	422.4571906875115
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	769.8258821504699
"It must have been his sister's doing.	448.58217601935746
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	774.6614736938353
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"
	627.8366397245624
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	688.8697395870238
I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	593.2471656369274
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	632.9554611562291
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	533.6121505011266
He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	536.0078999003763
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.	655.0366977131927
"Exceedingly well.	592.3640888758189
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a

children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
	658.8622024577576
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	729.3075419595818
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	633.1148739175447
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	661.7947463688552
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment.	565.8171705810681
Their table was superlatively stupid.	758.9927680419709

least.	694.0615981903263
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	608.5662231239653
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice?	826.9478885638187
[Illustration: DOVE-DALE]
	592.3640888758189
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	623.4687217861474
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	514.3415617070666
She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	469.8135782579015

them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	602.86937781921
