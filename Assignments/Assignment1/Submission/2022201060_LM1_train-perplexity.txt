PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	592.3640888758189
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	619.2041120280618
"My dear Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"
	658.5173286544457
Bennet replied that he had not.	248.15021696582866
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.	707.3517923781084
Bennet made no answer.	230.29419607648816
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	683.1464611148243
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
	608.2072646334968
This was invitation enough.	728.2762576714733
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.	390.25341857941066
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."
	476.1165711198637
"What is his name?"
	601.2900019354006
"Is he married or single?"
	651.1809907801755
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.	463.1407091978816
What a fine thing for our girls!"
	795.5909966688209
"How so?	592.3640888758189
how can it affect them?"
	627.4730883152289
"My dear Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
	467.69541169098767
"Is that his design in settling here?"
	795.4931799266147
"I see no occasion for that.	439.9925792210589
You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr.	675.1536955340965
Bingley might like you the best of the
party."
	455.3687843320963
"My dear, you flatter me.	758.9749340385672
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	595.453019892364
When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."
	689.9776509977514
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.	553.9065872759653
Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."
	581.5023538664041
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
	479.4732784650805
"But consider your daughters.	728.2644461272968
Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	386.8552971097698
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	739.1044798175725
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."
	433.9065702080246
I dare say Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
	642.6073308940626
"I desire you will do no such thing.	482.36577370808783
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia.	588.1538243085266
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference."
	733.6870573029148
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	425.1442045692987
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."
	605.8011218626185
"You mistake me, my dear.	375.23413448726194
I have a high respect for your nerves.	807.2932027555142
They
are my old friends.	758.9927680419709
I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."
	674.4508998696977
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."
	271.73639027770884
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
	575.3861860660303
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."
	653.2624515485984
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	686.2647101473161
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	795.5850162220227
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	835.5825132891653
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	807.4986339664414
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	728.8588259747366
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.	646.3897999587649
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,
	776.6709483711263
"I hope Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley will like it Lizzy."
	643.3861298029659
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.	603.0203194465223
Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
	608.1095933572808
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs.	755.2881559260467
Long has promised to introduce him."
	642.5365904718877
"I do not believe Mrs.	465.2431779102819
Long will do any such thing.	614.991917868454
She has two nieces
of her own.	465.04467136970567
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."
	616.3986144288652
"No more have I," said Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."
	551.4971146426207
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	535.9278883485001
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves.	643.870259937921
You tear them to pieces."
	758.9415555917623
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.	692.1551626162606
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"
	728.1957901074186
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.	457.15323223403806
Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."
	472.5441903608703
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr.	502.80614459584694
Bingley to _her_."
	461.19280737506995
"Impossible, Mr.	592.3640888758189
"I honour your circumspection.	728.2762576714733
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	504.77605643756175
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs.	743.4465753718042
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."
	814.66427878068
The girls stared at their father.	780.0313342991958
Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"
	592.3640888758189
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.	592.8001316570352
What say you,
Mary?	592.3640888758189
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts."
	661.286130735749
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	629.4406785511967
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.	763.7875204480694
"I am sick of Mr.	552.0029585398223
Bingley," cried his wife.	339.6634811268296
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."
	764.9536536854852
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	646.2459334565325
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	591.1561932853301
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.	547.068593213161
Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last.	594.0717499478322
I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	735.2226312780907
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.	473.8387874760121
Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	551.8903392885442
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	692.2970827420636
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	587.5130980921571
Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr.	703.6050054223537
Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."
	556.0551463622153
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."
	621.2079055226801
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr.	427.76038490716934
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr.	651.6314462678772
They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas.	654.7487599423594
Her report was highly favourable.	758.9632222846222
Sir William had been
delighted with him.	497.3653342316989
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	604.704161061008
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr.	701.4956905425627
Bingley's heart were entertained.	758.9730716644875
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs.	637.9712815393666
Bingley returned Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	611.722819489769
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	633.6437979775442
The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	763.5681913893541
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs.	731.8065434819699
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	713.1450949057006
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c.	508.23378980627194
Bennet was quite
disconcerted.	728.1226362602736
She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	567.5948841101738
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.	568.262383489703
Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	663.7573508582827
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr.	761.954300214764
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	674.8158562850305
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	732.362715155692
His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	607.4624731360145
His brother-in-law, Mr.	483.6209578891355
Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	640.0227040681499
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr.	583.278727050261
Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	733.5113700569377
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.	681.2709531915307
Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	713.1767387802606
Darcy danced
only once with Mrs.	679.8136295000513
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	461.299372000228
His character was decided.	544.4021471796432
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	487.7375176429246
Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	653.9314041054312
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.	727.6800444888257
Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr.	617.2021563090193
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	613.5317059304616
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	679.738673950912
You had much better
dance."
	651.1181882742488
"I certainly shall not.	728.216898326789
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	707.062306851758
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	561.0068412519786
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."
	494.7734851384221
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."
	588.8777481186942
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.	618.519046991958
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	597.4739850081553
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable.	578.2699036888914
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."
	750.0485419337168
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
	721.6132232530585
Bingley followed his advice.	728.2644461272968
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	645.2062368899064
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	638.982406270506
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.	627.813143843251
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	695.6446262424491
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure.	643.377781986115
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	576.5654826337441
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	782.2555992729452
They found Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet still up.	679.8195901065612
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	580.3816574583583
He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	566.9866919844134
"Oh! my dear Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	538.7559331801165
I wish you had been there.	366.9625222260543
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr.	684.3613173454577
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	573.9431374469301
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	448.82519259582034
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	666.7314376498554
I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.	552.1037548604223
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	698.0079787992481
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"
	586.2343186878371
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"
	532.6535145475174
"Oh! my dear," continued Mrs.	643.9659565926992
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.	421.39017864772086
I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	494.13893320745046
Here she was interrupted again.	758.9800493551043
Bennet protested against any
description of finery.	795.6499982194424
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.	676.582355707078
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	607.2658212313133
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	582.6096322938807
I quite detest the man."
	651.2323732396998
CHAPTER IV.	592.3640888758189
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	642.52748542686
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	663.9922241847511
His character is thereby complete."
	758.9730716644875
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	595.8222418610475
I
did not expect such a compliment."
	565.2526613272977
"Did not you?	679.6164647091683
_I_ did for you.	467.0530270550753
But that is one great difference between
us.	733.8095504508433
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	750.1648093527504
What
could be more natural than his asking you again?	661.8306920826303
He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	485.40439554763856
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	672.9338504958744
You have liked many a
stupider person."
	795.6426243399092
"Dear Lizzy!"
	592.3640888758189
You never see a fault in any body.	646.5880468324189
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	824.303489112255
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."
	539.0476042854912
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think."
	589.6078609239663
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	658.1725743906953
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	691.898998174499
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	730.2314001473189
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	830.5695324101125
Their manners are not equal to his."
	549.2672865070506
"Certainly not; at first.	381.0516565537175
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	698.4715793115118
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."
	606.0985696623162
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	662.7593930719529
They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	693.8925353525235
They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	622.211670067782
They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	729.5850262952952
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr.	752.7021732713001
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	715.7068543461465
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	595.0694318542199
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	777.9757703831566
He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	693.4712038344593
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	631.9870236654419
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	600.4741678064112
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever.	455.8823378189779
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	606.0980887376038
In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	717.8329709059489
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	563.6751883393024
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	657.7159105863614
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	720.9574858091316
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	672.544747594871
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	487.09050056884945
Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	693.6429665785764
CHAPTER V.	592.3640888758189
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	696.0355814600574
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	807.5136396328123
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	658.6055526937672
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	616.769056838088
By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.	651.1809912502783
Bennet.--They had several children.	698.8028474319237
The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	792.8862123872293
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	714.6414708107037
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.	656.7632488159006
Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas.	691.6227883723086
"_You_ were Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley's first choice."
	728.2526336691179
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."
	717.5751643698029
"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.	505.2897114895658
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr.	660.5120193127934
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.	570.0838845376644
Robinson; did not
I mention it to you?	471.2824055977563
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	571.2272344265916
and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."
	613.9771311865092
"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."
	722.8420358736196
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte.	619.7483170640504
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."
	701.8195532221358
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	585.5088793728255
Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."
	540.164655068161
Darcy speaking to her."
	330.72195519402874
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."
	623.221205730989
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	693.2163237905655
With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."
	780.1300978209395
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	399.4993373344774
If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	429.997519029329
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."
	753.1957279960238
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	745.3194333978447
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."
	616.2703859435383
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."
	624.9341595449939
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."
	528.8450590786092
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	589.7910334019225
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	620.3976866138938
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."
	723.308067376845
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
	579.9241607974595
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	584.2784413230268
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	840.1613202056875
A person may be
proud without being vain.	807.2351192460623
"If I were as rich as Mr.	666.570494178392
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	666.6000333736395
I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."
	752.704782997667
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.	514.739870203775
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	617.8555560714531
CHAPTER VI.	592.3640888758189
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	670.5004777674433
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs.	753.8661911428044
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	708.8516318420557
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	610.6277937215028
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	602.497670939538
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	503.653884002641
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	699.337473349587
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	630.872494943465
We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	665.370324853359
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	850.338074174048
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
	695.5542804131817
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	642.8270376425583
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."
	608.1917517518729
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
	486.9054205770632
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."
	618.8737930367389
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	682.1106444790063
But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	714.2340537070124
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	626.6550595986458
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."
	564.041069713858
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	719.4285322588086
But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	684.298348037347
As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	704.369986592187
She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	610.0849407790298
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."
	648.8016352784454
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
	649.6766308614131
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	497.6069436626986
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	682.0834472230742
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."
	657.0789178127742
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	394.998995921011
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
	540.2555764583547
Occupied in observing Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	574.4242755669326
But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	612.0912590741771
Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	678.7921959159942
Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	616.6971668920304
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	563.6044661090137
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	632.6440434173348
"What does Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"
	650.6683870126299
"That is a question which Mr.	471.606772979237
Darcy only can answer."
	728.2526347746856
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about.	641.7094048508222
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
	639.6124470324578
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,
	565.8490024488086
"Did not you think, Mr.	551.8954777747101
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"
	677.4088225988469
"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."
	543.7333150906207
"You are severe on us."
	651.1640906096776
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.	706.9835362698008
"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
	684.3541115061565
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
at Mr.	600.753411048358
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."
	797.0637863697732
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	543.0760308814461
After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	658.0567551649966
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	721.4072488252983
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	686.0470590642993
Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."
	547.0062092689058
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
dance."
	709.9056918915389
Sir William only smiled.	656.803401688604
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.	652.370173332025
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."
	649.3198669132918
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	763.1987023354405
Do
you often dance at St.	679.8195901065612
"Never, sir."
	592.3640888758189
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
	728.2611596249901
Darcy bowed.	592.3640888758189
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,
	626.8747428450474
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.	620.9391538881995
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.	599.7201291833762
Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,
	795.6384347830545
"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
	596.090683627704
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	623.3911121360875
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	773.8162001607803
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."
	615.2638630961409
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	666.5527942109807
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"
	708.7996537182784
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	686.6716308045688
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,
	671.3252646100618
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."
	620.4177877734561
"I should imagine not."
	728.2762576714733
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	690.0246113393973
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"
	679.6887519718625
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	553.889773504709
My mind was more
agreeably engaged.	780.0803610032468
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
	729.0889549611234
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,
	758.8524545280031
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
	592.3640888758189
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.	592.3640888758189
"I am all astonishment.	728.240822508087
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
joy?"
	661.9893972921745
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	607.8293765734622
A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	710.7256974435202
I knew you would be wishing me joy."
	733.5760556096661
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	620.7077615595852
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."
	532.8487401009555
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	692.8921350436531
CHAPTER VII.	592.3640888758189
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	730.0958122510561
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	589.3467039022314
She had a sister married to a Mr.	728.1612779963116
Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.	590.2127637886077
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	669.6373860839573
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	750.7854475366543
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters.	742.3842440358817
Their visits to Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.	673.8021171750025
Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	636.2043292978092
Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	741.2475355537148
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.	654.6644350055723
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	761.9667659935105
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.	631.3663404768567
Bennet coolly observed,
	679.8195901065612
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	560.7575310028258
I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."
	692.12484844581
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.	393.72645362880115
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.	548.9116794768725
If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."
	629.2436008850322
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."
	481.7240062365433
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
	560.8519632626269
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	633.0310718295743
"My dear Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	575.988314228733
I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals."
	678.1139408104324
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."
	711.4671217159388
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	635.2057405625804
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
	600.1346691804647
"Well, Jane, who is it from?	728.0838248655228
what is it about?	395.34481715976983
what does he say?	504.1698803961194
Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
	655.2885536919285
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	637.7142683956488
"My dear Friend,
	592.3640888758189
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
	633.420054746857
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
	529.2666572282479
lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
	765.5737564993979
end without a quarrel.	895.3250433169455
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
	417.7662376246537
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	504.0177563913858
Yours ever,
	592.3640888758189
"CAROLINE BINGLEY."
	592.3640888758189
"With the officers!" cried Lydia.	643.2838821449809
"Dining out," said Mrs.	592.3640888758189
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.	564.3680002567429
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."
	580.6275603802602
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."
	588.0930586049745
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr.	706.8028064739235
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
	644.6266298304835
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	650.3147419757471
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr.	509.6896821000957
Bennet, are not they?"
	728.0385716803704
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
	640.3736420120107
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."
	707.6453466104701
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	764.7925066336999
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	598.2241032413743
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	680.2703613929878
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.	660.7475665830121
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.	702.8401862497851
Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	440.9398027235511
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:
	738.3159904356868
"My dearest Lizzy,
	592.3640888758189
"I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
	557.3826912545767
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	895.2238143956165
My kind friends will
	728.2526336691179
not hear of my returning home till I am better.	685.6173292339089
They insist also on
	728.2762576714733
my seeing Mr.	680.5512961903189
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
	629.5219524728919
of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
	662.4092250479317
there is not much the matter with me.	318.8571788270251
"Yours, &c."
	592.3640888758189
"Well, my dear," said Mr.	451.3498453635569
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr.	541.8086172402416
Bingley, and under your orders."
	651.1725418264352
People do not die of little
trifling colds.	807.6641531714711
She will be taken good care of.	795.4609512496281
As long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	558.4827252903838
I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage."
	546.3238197491654
She declared her resolution.	728.2970097737796
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."
	442.6682356155365
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
	654.5016230124952
"No, indeed.	592.3640888758189
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	517.9884586003163
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	835.7468933280006
I shall be back by dinner."
	780.0159621081341
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
	757.1571660706026
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."
	694.3133474088806
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	707.3038555726173
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	662.3671141302148
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	564.2881302695073
Darcy said very
little, and Mr.	679.7208167350004
Hurst nothing at all.	231.66379008795016
The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	752.6335566366381
The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	807.2225058266781
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	763.6299844980555
Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	675.0503393246603
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	756.5513515069578
She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	824.260432650725
Elizabeth silently attended
her.	728.2430542103738
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane.	693.2155398621319
The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	629.6473242334529
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	679.9486300479795
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	669.469482312237
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present.	584.3747034406492
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	799.401751023836
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	673.7575543458449
Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	404.68865015414644
Jane was by no means better.	357.37677041649744
The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	630.7506250766675
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	508.56318416718096
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	743.8388216971174
She had very little notice from any but him.	750.0779629215538
Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr.	634.5870405968009
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.	597.9010944571955
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	619.5141386447232
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	373.2051375602045
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	605.9758258556561
Hurst
thought the same, and added,
	642.4799585522536
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	840.1016989822307
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	569.9826669333296
She really
looked almost wild."
	758.9927680419709
"She did indeed, Louisa.	592.3640888758189
I could hardly keep my countenance.	686.6447469267729
Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	748.0153205326947
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"
	780.1868542870743
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."
	756.9619270739153
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	647.1397804968127
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	523.9572339238092
"_You_ observed it, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."
	462.8635598923692
"Certainly not."
	592.3640888758189
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it?	801.449036011749
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."
	786.8581748157067
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.	489.90560418867034
"I am afraid, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."
	669.2448414811324
Hurst began again.	679.8195901065612
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	604.0316365844836
But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it."
	437.54998234242436
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."
	576.4866307367793
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
	758.9182423494306
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	623.3247026195944
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."
	649.0310996708848
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	657.4339574528586
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	676.407057499914
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	699.9693633241108
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	568.8459966647381
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	330.9488959945001
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."
	730.0695984815253
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.	623.7572114139525
She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."
	570.5003635450992
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
	712.6593562709883
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."
	608.3279283561451
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	736.1947715985796
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	783.9843800636227
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into."
	729.4903446284901
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	457.8175583272227
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr.	693.673437805884
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."
	497.56974578150135
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."
	804.9594173900396
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."
	721.5460340200816
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	716.4947928669575
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	713.1627703043988
There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."
	605.7824292442405
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
	584.444469049127
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
	679.8211848326415
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."
	728.2192066781405
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.	717.0692258807567
Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	688.7634089798843
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"
	704.8645716628304
"I think she will.	601.3271986103681
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."
	703.6088092680211
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	509.46189775861495
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."
	716.5400258913604
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."
	712.5408584279303
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
	421.3912810375217
"Yes, all of them, I think.	500.2105499569261
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	816.8336354920028
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."
	592.2974657310356
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	817.8603252165312
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	688.5470371397546
I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."
	632.0225779365812
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.	509.3326104022172
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."
	585.3306089031767
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."
	375.99097996658315
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	780.5335898732415
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."
	780.743354440342
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."
	608.1516019564564
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	784.0562362909295
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."
	733.7664846863973
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"
	577.161784244933
"_I_ never saw such a woman.	392.1398375443561
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."
	732.0521724507383
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr.	810.3968196336493
Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	718.2746522650813
As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	536.1258950586234
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds.	595.1898792530194
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."
	623.3785255157718
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	838.183473916053
Bingley urged Mr.	592.3640888758189
Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	703.4481781025605
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better.	614.2871499338103
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	671.9227887114922
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	760.2537527559642
CHAPTER IX.	592.3640888758189
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	709.6243201167862
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	735.5841345004347
Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	710.782522715542
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	649.2932971430422
Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	654.6924943989422
She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	745.555165539663
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	638.5204059293021
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs.	707.0147195115022
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	553.6675241813292
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.	597.4150247746568
"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	488.17089002462376
Jones says we must not think of moving her.	599.2786511482238
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."
	696.8101199060386
"Removed!" cried Bingley.	592.3640888758189
"It must not be thought of.	614.6277436636035
My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."
	631.3029177918793
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	780.0650994604617
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	747.1361492757416
You have a sweet room here, Mr.	707.0182742103532
Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	816.6118596088625
I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield.	492.9777568097163
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease."
	607.9396272024416
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes.	688.503611307324
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
	674.5586833780688
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	598.9998117907132
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.	784.0858157220799
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly."
	679.819590106562
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."
	578.8613313224693
"That is as it happens.	651.0928550021928
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
	800.0420746420575
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
	585.1554116308207
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	518.0025366493064
It must be an amusing study."
	686.5129858545192
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	807.4677930729513
They have at
least that advantage."
	642.4826665329775
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	686.9646650544242
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."
	709.5969657150957
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."
	603.6269176838858
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	629.4219182401754
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."
	525.7588312100834
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	547.2765984115799
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	756.750424045178
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	758.1163453568884
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.	646.409011594423
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	592.5918493936263
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
	763.7511282951151
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	688.833750461175
But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."
	574.8396268177405
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	498.1151754858257
"You quite mistook Mr.	592.3640888758189
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."
	570.7438245509329
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	740.1580776155376
I know we dine with four and twenty families."
	816.7979904641971
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance.	679.772498251965
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr.	770.4035281190884
Darcy with a very expressive smile.	614.5958111294315
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	539.0758323860518
What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr.	623.7470945378509
Bingley--is not he?	544.2974384552168
so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."
	684.7159257519462
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
	489.74244930919605
"No, she would go home.	651.3289252268763
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	816.7744573753389
For
my part, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	832.3454297701269
But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you.	550.9591947599972
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."
	631.4574907229893
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	684.1986198859933
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	629.3511326332374
Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	739.9108293727749
I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	529.9230727854608
It is what every body says.	604.2581381060185
I do not trust my own
partiality.	795.7332988939795
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	525.6215787350583
But however he did not.	293.90147574345445
Perhaps he thought her too young.	780.0904021803946
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."
	735.3220839584311
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.	691.626818175981
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	573.8403185549312
I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
	840.2360202609977
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.	700.6315888913782
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	733.7430041369795
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	795.7218773106973
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
	701.2346269732876
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	747.6908974958187
She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	424.61119143007596
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.	707.0868401541269
Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	666.5976216410451
Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	832.6184472091401
She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	758.9730712035201
Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	717.6641473836281
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	668.4482721736206
The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr.	590.2593412702169
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	618.8493721042196
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	823.5213231776283
She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	728.8356762579699
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr.	728.13060031649
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	378.5398772894427
His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	662.1119782942651
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	642.2832480118226
Lydia declared herself satisfied.	728.2784910665329
"Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.	601.5397332162408
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.	680.7267420894948
I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
	421.6855351540989
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	464.81642329776327
CHAPTER X.	592.3640888758189
The day passed much as the day before had done.	613.3908015133177
Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	526.4026154353719
The loo table, however, did not appear.	549.4175301871455
Hurst and Mr.	592.3640888758189
Hurst was observing their game.	758.9927680419709
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	771.2088507314107
The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	743.9627206986535
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
	622.3373542473763
He made no answer.	230.29419607648816
"You write uncommonly fast."
	728.2762576714733
"You are mistaken.	526.5896192831528
I write rather slowly."
	728.2762576714733
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"
	523.694755346711
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."
	799.0749581129221
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
	429.48746315329777
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."
	824.2607648336735
"I am afraid you do not like your pen.	432.3588661537431
Let me mend it for you.	580.158501204884
I mend
pens remarkably well."
	758.9730716644875
"Thank you--but I always mend my own."
	597.8887276431558
"How can you contrive to write so even?"
	807.4074327946457
He was silent.	461.2127522486373
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
present I have not room to do them justice."
	628.4220310420297
"Oh! it is of no consequence.	642.8039607865481
I shall see her in January.	598.3084231666277
But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.	780.2045486874563
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."
	604.4729118740655
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."
	826.7235290678977
He studies too much for
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"
	632.6250069767908
"My style of writing is very different from yours."
	750.0398003385037
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	636.3985632699375
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
	783.6054850883398
"Your humility, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
	679.819590106562
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	617.9502193768993
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."
	835.7433437746361
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
	735.6144283656417
When you told Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"
	697.8229708405324
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	629.5287306985699
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."
	725.4455085333044
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	570.4681726182162
Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."
	760.6877083672989
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.	698.7985650579893
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	483.43510306044345
You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."
	735.6440442081472
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	760.2128641484632
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."
	637.3734941857282
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
	795.0436423287538
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged.	700.6332024828123
Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."
	735.0750526458618
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."
	711.1827218073082
"You appear to me, Mr.	509.726042972872
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	716.5131554730317
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	820.9901933690669
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr.	635.0373956887565
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	758.3872632414416
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
	747.4317150563975
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"
	683.9256588760453
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	708.1150527389285
I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."
	608.5618201627551
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	581.5953535835318
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	731.8798076058082
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."
	737.1526352313978
"Perhaps I do.	592.3640888758189
Arguments are too much like disputes.	686.5597664051825
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
	553.3803268381014
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.	599.2075914036678
Darcy had much better finish his letter."
	541.2926118704319
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	659.1139382032147
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	713.989106412512
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	724.4322095228237
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.	630.9478389411175
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	588.5785592518774
She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	669.9885007758922
The supposition did not pain her.	780.0360267021969
She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	733.6198962509214
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.	634.7479782743962
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"
	604.1566201592676
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	824.1618255494059
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	560.9927583800077
I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."
	697.3812315126495
"Indeed I do not dare."
	699.0475413942448
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	615.0110223265394
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	688.7275536076648
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."
	651.1802979962714
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
	716.612642556808
"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	551.828992929389
Put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	750.0985706949552
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	653.5938506459811
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
	656.8196556299087
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."
	774.7638340958929
Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.	592.3640888758189
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	560.4053157139884
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.	707.0999471481183
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."
	617.2166575834374
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.	707.0802858280458
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself.	628.3942016142245
Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--
	673.7627888762389
"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	816.7270383896997
We had better go into the
avenue."
	639.2832052969923
"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	686.1117201570203
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	816.5861844354525
Good bye."
	592.3640888758189
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	582.8633424103206
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	633.103485244364
CHAPTER XI.	592.3640888758189
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	584.3079563864749
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	780.1362337978275
They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	790.8035206608222
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	486.930791425775
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	573.4475891852793
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.	679.7196359264228
Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	639.0346676328116
He was full of joy and
attention.	795.6131143130164
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	598.0666499107496
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	497.89963654876794
When tea was over, Mr.	509.7789594948197
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	555.156327918776
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.	707.0999471481183
Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	807.5042623921379
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	562.7674454324992
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	568.9010171140741
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs.	616.9166639854511
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.	686.0890626720823
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.	564.8269844314786
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	730.8853661386598
She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	796.603130800169
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."
	646.8715333773481
No one made any reply.	601.3628309836213
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."
	703.7355078145644
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards."
	682.4996525369872
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."
	647.8768272893705
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."
	554.1731099013238
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	366.5757872846964
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	706.8092253061623
In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,
	740.4326110334073
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."
	652.455494756816
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	576.4217853661883
Darcy looked
up.	679.8426392674974
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	727.6544392552761
He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	714.9415578042634
"What could he mean?	728.2334733536308
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	543.1035175229292
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."
	616.0791416414186
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.	628.4085254621615
Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	672.6186530153062
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	406.2952028123539
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."
	752.600523888476
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.	592.3640888758189
"I never heard any thing so
abominable.	713.2653500155009
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
	606.866144545223
"We
can all plague and punish one another.	807.507091278667
Teaze him--laugh at
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
	433.4272797557361
"But upon my honour I do _not_.	543.6608161979236
I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	650.2137045522019
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no--I feel he may defy us there.	690.1907706512462
And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	774.5028323035019
Darcy may hug himself."
	728.2762576714733
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.	456.4791122276976
"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	577.2371475682069
I dearly love a
laugh."
	758.9632241282981
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	723.3368214355643
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."
	721.0213588295849
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	501.13145269418175
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."
	687.7767174120003
"Such as vanity and pride."
	558.6689313021486
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	780.0694423395529
But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
	672.5902539439596
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	795.6498050380912
"Your examination of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"
	517.694551025912
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.	661.7747632865775
Darcy has no defect.	728.1935576627184
He owns it
himself without disguise."
	780.1784186270178
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.	653.7305820624562
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	597.8958561270307
My temper I dare not vouch
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	562.9012010006113
I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	755.3979928476224
My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	689.9963804613354
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."
	626.8818580590356
"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.	707.0152875067652
"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	733.6913619086021
But you have chosen your fault well.--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	720.04425715159
You are safe from me."
	601.340900307677
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
	835.7441990659316
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."
	684.7876294467908
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr.	507.49583207040433
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	500.79289794191095
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	707.019890521845
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	427.93013537603827
But Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	720.4095270041403
Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr.	685.1252229792907
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	677.5865229893702
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	694.7281678035316
Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	640.122428294937
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	473.820378780132
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.	557.2395566040389
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	686.6320298159123
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	754.789758143173
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	574.4666520917233
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	740.0447458346698
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	571.0606673240555
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	763.4838637566062
Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	691.355187310444
The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.	633.5476055933241
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	803.3574423055461
Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	718.4430030951646
Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.	639.4785475372207
CHAPTER XIII.	592.3640888758189
"I hope, my dear," said Mr.	505.9353349031201
Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
	562.6604474705335
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	613.6319827079159
I do not believe she often sees such at home."
	579.4049005077424
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	521.8400496600713
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.	542.2493781380118
Bingley
I am sure.	421.36347723536767
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.	637.214515248049
Bingley.--But--good
lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	612.5616856666943
Lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	686.6256728087029
I must speak to Hill, this moment."
	564.4425331062414
"It is _not_ Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."
	446.59959198446654
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	515.103975893374
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	774.6125574393411
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	745.456925852045
It is from my cousin, Mr.	679.7166510727695
Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."
	470.192834200607
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	733.8029832932567
I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."
	587.7955607621786
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	618.5604005528747
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	676.1062135269422
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.	595.6684466691918
Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr.	679.782429121919
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	706.6062010145022
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."
	662.8406318866075
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	598.1415595090393
I hate such false
friends.	758.9927680419709
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"
	708.0417974525083
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."
	681.9865161786114
_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,
	592.3640888758189
15th October._
	592.3640888758189
DEAR SIR,
	592.3640888758189
The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
	750.0911190969218
father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
	710.6705223303771
terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
	585.823914817729
variance.--"There, Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on
	780.1260523659763
the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
	583.4530112747034
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
	543.6631295843448
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
	894.6794519560453
rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
	787.8686261845833
demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
	790.9647233071782
ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
	895.2675742134101
instituted by the Church of England.	679.8195901065612
As a clergyman, moreover, I
	643.3710122011759
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
	795.7926088864838
commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
	504.2354299802946
entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
	799.8050641701735
I cannot be
	461.14078013418646
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
	740.022155606178
amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
	515.0219966297801
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
	794.8679791206886
of this hereafter.	693.3539895962491
into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
	558.993369303518
you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
	623.5469689789414
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
	816.8075310370937
Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
	666.6178001976723
Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
	722.584475440558
duty of the day.	311.0040811619554
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
	807.4974597201257
your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
	895.1881140000594
WILLIAM COLLINS."
	592.3640888758189
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr.	753.278525155376
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	673.6731717448896
"He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."
	649.7429775306085
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."
	604.1828986029873
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."
	794.2211945301606
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	813.8349523162199
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.	485.83259995265547
"I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"
	684.5712426375989
"No, my dear; I think not.	634.5870405968009
I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	824.2888145023222
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	686.5189069985364
I am impatient to see him."
	414.60010788130666
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	753.6372860334744
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."
	662.659378077522
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	741.2840423107064
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	625.130103738239
As for
their mother, Mr.	643.26084182622
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	596.87245182413
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	570.6902047056202
Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	768.1734026012018
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	602.7042450702701
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	689.9482213989447
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs.	516.7804442534057
Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	678.0766634444486
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs.	588.7855933446289
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,
	816.7839802166511
"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	661.0563465328761
Things are settled so
oddly."
	758.9927680419709
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."
	688.454403213675
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	784.0262247077279
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world.	774.8079723467871
There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."
	805.0270693573168
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	706.5109074380134
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them.	610.9638460472144
At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"
	713.1360082892946
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	600.8499429150374
The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	699.8648300786735
Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	801.3145295308458
But here he was set right by Mrs.	728.0195260451276
Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	562.5176215638866
He begged
pardon for having displeased her.	795.636641993342
In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	551.1680191798806
During dinner, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	704.3821961514786
Bennet could not have chosen
better.	496.29399142136
Collins was eloquent in her praise.	686.5690869851621
The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine.	561.447419769863
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	634.053432474959
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	630.6468501883878
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	669.314602701731
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	623.2853383890414
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	675.5222657706008
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.	557.8609435362652
Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	390.7375228232167
It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	677.9565247101883
Does she live near you, sir?"
	780.1615452116428
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."
	643.4909039047527
"I think you said she was a widow, sir?	607.0205087394171
has she any family?"
	739.2546685197872
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."
	772.499636760827
"Ah!" cried Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	784.0606586866433
And what sort of young lady is she?	587.4832665105505
"She is a most charming young lady indeed.	627.6188981194827
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	716.8009288472845
She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	700.2668131695586
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
	765.7702748434226
"Has she been presented?	728.2171952323032
I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."
	830.6425770614588
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament.	670.9272243430806
Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	691.0910929289533
Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	745.6931270233589
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"
	715.7425183629562
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."
	720.972816944206
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	780.1868542870743
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	654.2394002728797
Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	578.4217036934534
Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	725.9995312429438
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,
	698.8648769536147
"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	593.2945977470993
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday.	728.1887698300981
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr.	721.8402749496051
Denny comes back from town."
	651.1640940720238
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,
	607.0821345742636
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	832.6838323073246
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	652.6172405967721
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."
	780.1360811360581
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	764.0295854117047
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr.	680.4740708175583
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.	781.5231918876785
Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	758.9533757981385
CHAPTER XV.	592.3640888758189
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	675.160044775582
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	685.7316588828743
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	678.4107137932332
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	673.782453519661
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	803.4292561218132
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	723.0608598992579
Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."
	673.7552573240387
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs.	575.5083272331538
Bennet was stirring the fire.	651.1656912340268
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	674.1187085141933
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	541.3223646331859
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.	646.8348968666731
Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr.	556.9728640276262
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.	609.3423127459404
Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.	665.506611616969
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	625.0158152206563
Such
doings discomposed Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet exceedingly.	592.3640888758189
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr.	726.7684356568196
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr.	702.9020002156058
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	837.8449675083808
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	728.6580160546577
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	647.5135334405322
The officer was the very
Mr.	679.6458025499288
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	713.0679783688471
All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	693.8334112178565
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr.	780.1647403594139
Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	690.4881226339043
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	595.7660189748315
His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	715.4211657685986
The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.	628.274738748287
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	668.1525352580943
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object.	714.5400174178382
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	606.6079727194152
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	816.7858376503464
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	427.69454393140217
In another minute Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	634.5627740916802
Denny and Mr.	592.3640888758189
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr.	398.60489015766905
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	563.6977574946994
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	830.470560820955
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr.	628.6300364513108
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr.	595.9740206299301
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	494.7232529459645
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	614.2070911313446
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.	691.5651859324012
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	436.77817287701987
She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.	635.1958490273557
Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.	615.348497622734
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening.	554.042300600123
This was agreed to, and Mrs.	598.3204851168363
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	720.4791005643468
The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	744.9820005603792
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	598.0670980957339
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	598.7099681367689
Bennet by admiring Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Philips's manners and politeness.	758.9453908190857
Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	513.5655741105484
CHAPTER XVI.	592.3640888758189
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr.	652.2865281741311
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.	679.8195901065612
Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr.	590.1028082717415
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	584.5635255121628
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.	700.754476583919
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs.	675.9031802807324
Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	694.3695963529593
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	668.0027257271522
Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	582.638854506757
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	670.7751457453097
It was over at last however.	780.0332879986472
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.	707.0868407675193
Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	607.5409289202906
The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr.	601.0922103464151
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	690.6759759590647
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	688.4891389898856
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.	625.3629936834437
Wickham and the
officers, Mr.	551.3352886605521
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs.	701.1585460209441
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	792.0117489765089
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	682.5709534741936
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.	694.4926621532575
Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	799.0438873954732
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	699.7466200447034
Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.	560.1127057010465
She dared not
even mention that gentleman.	795.6025581753685
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	780.1362298485731
Wickham began the subject himself.	759.1441305726032
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr.	735.405367899387
Darcy had been staying there.	758.3958396138448
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."
	690.9920952333862
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	614.9363941502761
A clear ten
thousand per annum.	686.7510845307427
You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."
	695.0449426187153
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."
	565.1035810935406
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	643.3241671926693
I am not qualified to form one.	795.6208081431159
It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	605.7465496819499
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."
	618.8955009288968
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	621.4814029160449
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.	540.0890143563049
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	795.5108222545572
You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."
	742.0097211754222
The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."
	729.8393980501675
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.	723.5603687959538
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."
	573.7771855632411
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield.	610.075465489238
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."
	491.6631977593879
"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.	537.7438394592529
If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	707.2513819444732
We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	676.3388329172199
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr.	567.7963556907686
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	835.2587554483889
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."
	706.1947143869959
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	724.7398122917367
Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	686.431040590184
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	754.0136920591208
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	555.1079058431245
I _must_ have employment and society.	780.1868542870743
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	792.8691125734463
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."
	601.9843106065587
"Yes--the late Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	792.3608631708477
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	530.5462643303559
I cannot do justice to his kindness.	485.15118609569663
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."
	637.05313596134
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"
	676.3645613207353
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	639.42101655801
A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr.	622.2024037964562
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	795.9466259612647
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	713.0409955382097
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	787.1425337710824
I can recal nothing worse.	758.9829202502245
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."
	583.733192977906
"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."
	728.1623348182172
Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
	739.9404745886808
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	772.597978295926
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
	700.7331821630335
Had the late Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	744.5976412819239
He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."
	659.601596222005
"I had not thought Mr.	509.7839763838941
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"
	661.8666701351009
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	674.9868145360234
His disposition must
be dreadful."
	651.0458994721636
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!"
	714.8087271846537
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	728.2326989816386
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property.	638.1742378868785
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.	707.0278374469256
Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	779.8887568082307
Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."
	660.3949853502127
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth.	592.3640888758189
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr.	714.4423991268961
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it."
	545.4803852091237
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	740.4887011438415
It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	729.4113292747397
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."
	710.4913736897404
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"
	830.4969344096783
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	720.282977600795
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	699.2911387666496
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	736.7742941186967
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"
	628.125232074335
He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	604.6157858246597
It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy.	515.9593933599019
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	693.8526224966271
But she is nothing to me now.	581.5223196273963
She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	731.3606637999609
Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."
	670.8041824054277
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,
	638.9477229434785
Bingley! How can Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	638.5455907712293
How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr.	670.5178789758955
"Not at all."
	278.44717856250907
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	733.6966881401731
He cannot know what Mr.	552.0029585398223
Darcy is."
	592.3640888758189
"Probably not;--but Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy can please where he chuses.	780.1378323599284
He does not
want abilities.	758.7887750462959
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	840.1033706072898
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	575.2716220030027
Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs.	698.7937801690031
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	718.1875113255936
It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs.	622.0988401845203
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	663.8164020696387
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.	628.4945333737563
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	720.0444680739586
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
	765.0423014290812
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.	636.9440512680353
"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections.	553.5249200408755
I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."
	557.6230692272766
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
	607.5758070119479
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	659.1325917198066
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
	617.1156878428789
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	560.4718546846483
She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."
	751.3736943740688
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.	528.6009236781265
Wickham's attentions.	679.8223698328422
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	835.7579000263622
She could
think of nothing but of Mr.	421.7796344066452
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.	529.3602630216908
Collins were once silent.	728.2762576714733
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr.	642.4245231624149
and
Mrs.	592.3640888758189
CHAPTER XVII.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.	442.4534068659712
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.	576.3638112660616
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	746.5809602017532
Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	569.1357763573876
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."
	731.1054686746351
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."
	602.8266554999601
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	432.53082847106987
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr.	636.4679172444214
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	636.5607351503392
Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	729.3476835747816
oh! no."
	271.32646757649525
"I can much more easily believe Mr.	707.0524694244147
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr.	764.3492613603322
Darcy contradict it.	679.8195901065612
Besides, there was truth in his
looks."
	795.6409593216177
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think."
	412.57550901199085
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."
	506.7432703124974
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	815.2278217781437
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr.	582.2006481815101
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.	695.7309871544845
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	693.1033575244156
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	435.3278677973657
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.	821.2148828048919
Bennet's civilities.	679.8195901065612
Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr.	684.4711669706352
Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	795.3077320634395
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.	605.1840243144916
Darcy's
looks and behaviour.	651.1640940720238
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.	726.2082405516345
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	577.64521439032
And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	446.05344860139036
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	691.4593516939295
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."
	667.2308362954687
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.	553.2237607412594
Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr.	464.8208885900512
Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	566.6159900373425
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."
	543.7152650606705
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	780.1362361673803
She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.	712.2927955150516
Collins
instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed.	816.482559174877
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr.	553.7173368598445
Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	561.3720581895288
She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	714.4970856641337
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	741.3924412223279
Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	728.0749102267251
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	551.233204500492
No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy.	807.3778039738806
Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.	712.545282703011
Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	579.8422203270873
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	591.8767422142357
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	505.59392182500295
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.	706.1441438031608
Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr.	593.8943675048707
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,
	614.789849656881
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
	616.1006423476433
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr.	568.2332889921171
Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	780.1868542870743
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	636.9210542832626
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	805.1406785510724
Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	756.1836622394669
The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	750.1501742545862
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	640.3611133220485
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.	578.1944169863316
Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	694.1458197414952
He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	638.8257007719116
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
	556.0402888480479
"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
such an evil."
	671.4456413901959
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	536.4882494595672
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.	601.5054726456374
Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	840.1545320930484
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	626.7995426742975
He replied, and was again silent.	779.876493638737
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with
	651.3170077258379
"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.	622.269976314018
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	588.1742344936288
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."
	676.5873017465411
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"
	824.3019921291889
One must speak a little, you know.	605.9013608004342
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."
	512.8851937156018
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
	715.6486135600818
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
	752.4367033130104
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he.	549.8966731648128
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
	632.02771264943
"I must not decide on my own performance."
	807.2863222118434
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."
	655.5828506624213
The effect was immediate.	728.2644461272968
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	632.9078946881187
At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,
	620.6109217378992
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."
	790.0610654173586
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."
	579.601149047836
At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.	526.7382377127811
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	768.0713222647345
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	702.7977449965881
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	807.3950883814499
It is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	763.1321962572848
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	677.6590571508742
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
	757.5144360012664
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,
	586.0566365728872
"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."
	628.6097730235825
"I do not think we were speaking at all.	414.11803883973903
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
	632.4019090501615
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."
	658.4443272054251
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."
	704.8647365091596
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.	611.4727703276798
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.	729.6518076311622
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."
	692.1872016800647
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
	816.6846617083253
"I hope not."
	679.8048892796321
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."
	795.0882386936892
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"
	766.844829563394
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	847.0811859012274
"I am trying to make it out."
	534.4242711797425
"And what is your success?"
	570.4543191162253
She shook her head.	339.7519793411438
"I do not get on at all.	542.8835320294963
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
	644.7101429349071
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."
	738.4145019443732
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	671.7948999587715
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	730.1247379844023
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr.	584.0539565324419
Darcy's steward.	679.7754844513119
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.	754.8269905450173
Darcy in a most infamous manner.	686.326201738709
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr.	442.2964993952747
Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	505.0035945087548
His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	601.3076827789403
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
	769.2457966174499
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr.	623.6304094719991
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."
	731.3888661161884
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	596.735358442757
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."
	666.5766718397521
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	656.3372441307309
I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.	741.7600538472288
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	740.9642180688412
But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."
	596.7996010546724
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	627.272570514852
Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr.	538.3840176796775
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr.	688.5218132847455
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.	728.2585398742578
Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr.	447.8690345569476
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	443.3818553738148
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.	552.3725359783565
Darcy's
regard."
	679.7782647778729
Bingley does not know Mr.	439.49332704230466
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
	770.3091351483921
"This account then is what he has received from Mr.	609.4818898054322
I am
perfectly satisfied.	601.2900019354006
But what does he say of the living?"
	576.8052601563685
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr.	795.5199348715047
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."
	527.2000625549615
"I have not a doubt of Mr.	450.5470274113557
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	688.9871505007535
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before."
	642.997597061364
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	760.812332880765
Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	595.8155092171493
On their being joined by Mr.	679.7681241511143
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.	688.0407599674777
Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	488.7797543741763
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine.	598.9736749282761
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	688.9861851314429
My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
	824.7724504723603
"Indeed I am.	592.3640888758189
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	673.9565299115901
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	514.8650505996454
It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."
	516.3402065746218
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr.	656.1298739482502
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.	555.3433057621556
Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.	758.9781313059432
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,
	608.9084993448064
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	657.1473656985722
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty.	717.0088399207631
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.	721.982356964751
Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	790.6413196475314
Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	586.6981278796467
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr.	649.8538110664482
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	607.9014829088877
Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	617.2482196886007
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	565.3461591485268
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	582.8121875080496
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
	517.2811094589628
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.	603.056546608441
She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	750.698857174474
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	751.5356905769129
When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr.	619.1772187940785
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	691.5666811570397
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	667.8202683465406
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	577.1547327126759
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	631.365969340541
It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	616.6641876017175
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	590.6848710862997
She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	611.8730366613323
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr.	596.0379323412484
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	642.572282972656
Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	807.4882593260957
"What is Mr.	592.3640888758189
I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
	640.1453599763822
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."
	672.5864168467913
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	610.0343418524933
Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	696.722459601727
Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	640.1568062696707
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr.	578.598870618904
The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	850.0214765133938
At length however Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	645.4776214438002
Elizabeth now began to revive.	758.8425789058481
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	701.8585645755774
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	630.2909580486681
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	685.8683484866642
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	630.5570849209661
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley.	650.4291066167797
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	663.275506388219
She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	574.1937248966317
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
	637.1967342101759
"That will do extremely well, child.	780.1578936000086
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	654.1224256797457
"If I," said Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	644.424029222899
The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	693.8097073289264
And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	588.7489786505504
I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family." And with a bow to Mr.	634.2048255021472
Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.	655.873149763427
Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.	728.1845252926801
Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	504.772282405124
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	608.2699508899976
That his two sisters and Mr.	471.643025688252
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	494.9954600149972
She was teazed by
Mr.	643.3861298029659
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	513.2563377324221
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	587.2166671585138
There was no arguing upon such a project.	807.1168988630009
She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr.	656.4435660260842
Collins's conversation to herself.	548.6145837774924
She was at least free from the offence of Mr.	657.6169375169903
Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	730.2097812471876
She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.	482.1989077101139
Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	420.290037762029
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs.	641.720029598153
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	552.0289949659868
Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	660.6858500523216
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr.	633.4251168954303
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.	643.2054846624285
Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	728.070158788717
Darcy said
nothing at all.	303.58271273793366
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	733.7438071673133
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	627.7970918898411
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.	653.8039645062568
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	513.0895575001302
Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr.	675.4322881955452
Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	632.1821949619246
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	698.0533741493266
Of having another daughter married to Mr.	707.0802870549333
Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	840.1773687173986
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr.	693.539100174644
Bingley and Netherfield.	592.3640888758189
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	745.1258471877852
Collins made his
declaration in form.	780.169982268582
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	664.0403592251654
On finding
Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,
	505.283536315876
"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"
	503.8186487170603
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.	625.7475647010999
Bennet instantly answered,
	679.8195901065612
"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.	507.4123072655651
Collins must excuse
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	521.8543900391644
I am
going away myself."
	758.9733387041312
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	688.4523896951172
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr.	306.0929459271354
Collins began.	592.3640888758189
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	661.8851962755555
You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	672.8643529316518
You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	796.4057320048244
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	559.1764640103186
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:
	674.1507599168178
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	794.0523473059377
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	625.0966797021555
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	584.050205488201
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.	673.0362583644638
Collins, you
must marry.	496.62891644264073
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	753.898412785938
This is my advice.	728.1935576627184
Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	567.7587045200868
You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	777.1207786213276
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years.	711.2929211180896
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	628.8866874004207
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	661.329768062201
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	635.3080259700107
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	673.1260650242896
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."
	722.9262667194789
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	634.3590582777131
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.	543.5965165240451
"You forget that I have made no
answer.	353.40107230020544
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	763.3551048854804
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."
	508.52031156158216
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr.	728.1820025602103
Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	733.0514748651382
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."
	627.6106445639382
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	747.3160294045083
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	606.8990168329872
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."
	621.9704559906698
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.	662.9933613968884
Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	680.2924295788298
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."
	542.2361511852935
"Indeed, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	807.2812631234016
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say.	518.0205994445016
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	673.509839674545
This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.	684.4236869095504
Collins thus
addressed her,
	728.2644461272968
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."
	677.9800861253801
"Really, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	625.7283664179962
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."
	619.6109682577818
My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	655.4150584197964
Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	716.3949244995439
As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."
	726.5784211647461
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	717.6968777240924
I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	716.5005887438674
I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	577.4075437695158
My feelings in every respect
forbid it.	543.2965690297775
Can I speak plainer?	656.8140542234568
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."
	760.2834195486295
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	750.353260424413
CHAPTER XX.	592.3640888758189
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs.	801.5228427906857
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	627.2455568215095
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	743.3276122732614
This information, however, startled Mrs.	643.3861298029659
Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	538.3489042710148
"But depend upon it, Mr.	430.24436638418354
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	674.4460174539522
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	689.0283707519251
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it."
	646.2082828294903
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.	596.7967370997897
Collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	682.8389987474517
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.	707.0880794788621
Bennet, alarmed.	592.3640888758189
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	539.9934430669873
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	623.9545233374075
I will go directly to Mr.	679.7828317541081
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
	545.8837027557687
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,
	589.7797647663527
"Oh! Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	746.9629746525832
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.	656.7820921509284
Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."
	507.4513015674764
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	585.4485148586107
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	415.2839101557647
"Of what are you talking?"
	470.63723996709456
"Of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins and Lizzy.	592.3640888758189
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.	470.2928924403376
Collins,
and Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
	356.9362733057315
"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."
	612.5301981555771
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	679.8303241259852
Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."
	632.8288531230875
"Let her be called down.	758.9632241282981
She shall hear my opinion."
	651.1403432237857
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	552.4599979330161
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	816.8936101529451
"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	763.5221741325903
I understand that Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	419.50146673261713
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.	400.042332452485
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"
	690.0160385115263
"I have, Sir."
	592.3640888758189
We now come to the point.	409.59739325698933
Your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	795.6721237205724
Is not it so, Mrs.	643.3527344967741
"Yes, or I will never see her again."
	455.3972133832263
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	633.8101210853831
Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."
	505.96772167262867
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs.	489.81167959433185
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	744.9338610567455
"What do you mean, Mr.	439.64111381012714
Bennet, by talking in this way?	523.8784280183538
You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."
	632.6286445761792
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	753.7522217921534
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	720.8881987930217
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."
	432.3468740402645
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs.	476.65504020926716
Bennet give up the point.	515.8787015675616
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	628.0795453952826
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	773.2868327826664
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	624.399442292424
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	789.4153947497622
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	671.1990744767429
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.	594.102270053611
Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."
	469.88549012407833
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs.	546.7720446616715
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	565.586377083927
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."
	665.8408698201066
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	555.5321881077396
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.	679.8048885916195
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	585.3745921068164
I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	548.261356493743
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	710.9786552781702
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so.	688.4997286781959
Those who do not complain are never
pitied."
	733.921106408114
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	755.9548972504015
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr.	573.2015247230029
Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
	654.9485275529747
"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr.	792.92577902166
Collins and me have a little conversation together."
	675.24979138086
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr.	581.3760034530948
Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	642.7372291406631
In a doleful voice Mrs.	643.3861298029659
Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"Oh! Mr.	691.6014117038208
"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	661.2233030420963
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	678.8924473310167
Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned.	514.8916262532806
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	783.7660054242713
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.	736.8054504412758
Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	741.5551140443189
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	704.6554114711324
But we are all liable to
error.	673.6751869644065
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	717.8649279416495
My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."
	711.0217215040169
CHAPTER XXI.	592.3640888758189
The discussion of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	637.3798846814191
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	511.279136632754
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	707.0999471481183
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	662.5881118068202
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	575.6744249141286
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	661.7508916626539
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.	642.0167752698484
Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	763.6991129948032
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	665.6759783672585
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr.	550.4546619147674
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
	604.8363164430939
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	672.2113645205258
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	707.0481726162774
The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	706.7012679740394
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	650.1753356932481
When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,
	678.7642069351693
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	654.6334749844582
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	637.1105830041712
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.	791.6059703759273
Hurst had a house.	728.0514170570729
The next was in these words.	604.279896047039
"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	708.436474947993
I depend on you for that." To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.	573.5642934028251
Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	520.5687784395164
But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.	756.061377730397
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."
	530.7850473631187
I will read it to you--
	467.8235635159538
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	638.3813563922258
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair.	633.6080747671498
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."
	732.1740387871553
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."
	619.7061769792715
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."
	728.1725589327241
"Why will you think so?	479.2296192809379
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	741.7681432405235
I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	824.3242277559601
Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	698.5399332072827
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	743.5477425486123
I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	549.4612503111244
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	646.5967500136437
With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"
	680.455082211669
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she
finished it.	616.9107236408857
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard?	641.3889162633754
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
	423.6588419509981
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"
	753.7931948169962
"You shall have it in few words.	795.5497380319744
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	501.7633949007836
She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."
	631.643660027452
Jane shook her head.	339.7519793411438
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	700.171172910048
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	679.9776724473306
She is
not such a simpleton.	614.6089919522002
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.	758.9819077221495
But the case is
this.	758.882305572835
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	666.6154998311646
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
	486.4117941376135
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	690.8596744983232
But I know the
foundation is unjust.	672.2725351093956
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."
	737.8660096573811
"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	553.3177692774482
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	462.3993102022407
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
	688.23510387029
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"
	720.1294288451326
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."
	686.322356525404
"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."
	646.2114347000595
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."
	722.3733590084476
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	696.1672836842345
A thousand things may arise in six months!"
	807.5005429776252
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	541.1609847974667
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	634.0972833393184
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	486.30730763869593
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	657.4419995919064
They agreed that Mrs.	592.3640888758189
After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr.	671.3344453776293
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	655.3214858295705
CHAPTER XXII.	592.3640888758189
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.	458.7743676444863
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	606.1153455207017
"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	653.1550357710088
This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr.	739.0040593445641
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	807.5136396328123
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	539.1728116421573
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	697.9083647384149
His
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	661.244846277849
Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	569.9612043816498
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	718.3550325097278
In as short a time as Mr.	707.0487500348477
Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	599.9644152251735
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	785.5528260077475
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	628.2039166625846
Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	762.3886426665019
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr.	782.3031777642673
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr.	677.7312922785333
James's.	592.3640888758189
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	645.2212061902029
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	758.9730716644875
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	575.0563998616958
Her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	686.5140417931121
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	636.9717277370708
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	736.3070420932138
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	610.5582195557429
The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	628.9632726972235
She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr.	692.4500984914674
A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	621.1227757037443
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs.	631.812202410863
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	677.8421270833996
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."
	545.7472072633964
Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,
	597.4434815012606
"My dear sir," replied Mr.	643.3905494277565
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."
	548.4355946556772
"You cannot be too much on your guard.	446.64396927804785
Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."
	628.265237973542
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	663.4956976991167
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth."
	606.8506085670052
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	634.2036089305742
Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	528.4065761684084
But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	611.839239091187
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	473.68601942256026
The possibility of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,
	571.3845880068286
Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"
	592.3640888758189
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,
	683.0657188634264
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr.	718.2273412641299
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"
	526.9194780606111
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	625.572051582085
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.	654.2255240367986
Collins was wishing to
marry you.	780.070561608432
I am not romantic you know.	567.9074839484432
I
never was.	679.8195901065612
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.	745.1130636240248
Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."
	646.5581601297373
Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	574.063239520975
It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	639.2052603242813
The strangeness of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	591.7595832766872
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	602.8564547750976
Charlotte the wife of Mr.	483.6209578891355
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	669.029176175072
CHAPTER XXIII.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	561.7296354319483
With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs.	769.8758186212334
Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,
	741.0803101537783
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
that Mr.	579.1593514641881
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	695.5024523480596
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr.	706.395411864697
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	679.3635764003039
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	636.8908411442326
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.	500.13505361488956
Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	711.2573127192193
Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	576.6206618890307
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	780.151645603345
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	648.3156038580969
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!
	599.2032758135101
Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.	638.5120250148785
Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.	693.2738561811778
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs.	625.8169312826217
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	732.0102947349726
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	628.0430671269303
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	700.4465060213693
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	740.5273841851888
The promised
letter of thanks from Mr.	598.7668043683474
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	677.4820335080703
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	625.3084328468443
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	652.9453679291358
Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.	686.2792542648274
Bingley's continued
absence.	728.2762576714733
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	558.0604934569736
Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	693.0673132582928
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	840.029026653629
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	712.996938046318
Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	625.286977255921
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	657.2739025020911
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	707.4788559037562
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	567.6263718859019
It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	772.5253812558242
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	643.4505980567009
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	733.4454060839446
The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	673.418866241208
The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her.	521.1950984693608
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	835.7255735225865
Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.	612.2207537648504
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.	387.50664553509796
Bennet were dead.	679.8195901065612
"Indeed, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"
	489.55730849553834
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	538.5323657439016
Let us hope for
better things.	780.1784186270178
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."
	624.6211135983974
This was not very consoling to Mrs.	576.619934289177
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,
	746.6689973829494
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	466.7112628737946
If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it."
	429.207314332912
"What should not you mind?"
	651.1229313674439
"I should not mind any thing at all."
	433.59483379098907
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."
	697.4838336530979
"I never can be thankful, Mr.	679.7003414467821
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	581.5949940049919
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.	684.358623419988

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	592.3640888758189
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	565.8534552551763
The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.	568.8231777503934
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	609.3927633999839
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	393.7735955950579
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	760.4175301350979
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	650.8324086136784
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	600.7656366106279
Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	518.1975599801274
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit.	557.3157700859232
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	630.7233291671294
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	602.6335135021524
It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	727.4899849769349
She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	648.8495426139013
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	461.4114395151831
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,
	574.0928028497941
"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	653.6447861816574
But I
will not repine.	698.8386497481528
It cannot last long.	728.2762576714733
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."
	709.5975074318179
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	520.391402024952
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	594.0988976369379
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	603.9278476240379
I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	756.4956570874652
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	707.1009440298419
A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."
	535.3828204738052
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."
	600.5367347778853
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.	532.726809961878
Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you.	368.06622441201546
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."
	786.9219060770861
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	691.7327210742133
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.	491.6528581020118
_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	600.1049257511455
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	840.284019188029
Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	826.5034037123033
There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	694.1898468605646
The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	674.2876494303625
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage.	655.8367522794538
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	485.78168158058764
Consider Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	711.7519402103383
Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."
	634.0217094998469
My dear Jane, Mr.	592.3640888758189
You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas.	648.2344024532385
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	633.6558427552694
But enough of this.	509.58458000664126
You alluded to something else.	651.1640906096776
You
mentioned _two_ instances.	728.2762576714733
We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	527.8914016723224
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	835.5891245407937
Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."
	807.5680698465158
"And men take care that they should."
	631.1627279560477
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."
	699.8835440487876
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr.	601.3008930305554
Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	783.5676854336699
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."
	607.6444822716538
"And do you impute it to either of those?"
	816.8385702906197
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem.	711.7380093908569
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."
	750.1518076750389
"I cannot believe it.	601.2704850502439
"Your first position is false.	758.9927680419709
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."
	720.0205443203677
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	719.7904088811365
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	785.3243525117414
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	614.5201626876167
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	749.7272610836842
By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	815.1522688659403
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	549.9700538486761
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."
	603.1211858172722
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.	686.6446110615067
Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	632.6944647545928
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	697.159059767663
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	607.8638702098555
Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr.	707.0999471481183
Bingley must be down again in the summer.	450.56926444317827
Bennet treated the matter differently.	758.9927828074061
"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find.	672.3017280692794
I congratulate her.	679.8195901065612
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	632.5152813822746
When is your turn to come?	642.5845240175928
You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane.	625.6718812268585
Now is your time.	728.1035136552639
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	433.7653779909708
Let Wickham
be _your_ man.	698.8028474319237
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."
	763.4699636078195
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	770.4180219909061
"True," said Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."
	487.86954289768744
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	772.3784417219061
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr.	703.5875290656315
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.	532.2770102397603
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	420.70459753848394
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.	720.8931994994803
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday.	550.4814242939684
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	581.850772938446
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	697.5074749890462
On the following Monday, Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn.	534.3877692738375
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	691.0619636645056
Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs.	661.6601479254462
Bennet and Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	715.017519556894
Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	724.1618350112952
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	589.0946785173887
The first part of Mrs.	643.3861298029659
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	850.1922488836259
When this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	720.8519472036064
It became her turn to listen.	780.1494664308727
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	598.8318948758179
Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	427.5920280065368
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.	579.2462730823773
Bingley, if she could.	449.93404629618897
Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	683.932874288563
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	546.9943123643308
They are all for what they can get.	807.3887755076511
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	535.3169067797173
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	715.6540960314535
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."
	605.2393731987893
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	627.3017882567726
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	465.0003489222117
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.	446.89085509763447
"I am
sorry it went off.	604.3835075246973
But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr.	689.4688881174144
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."
	671.7551946673963
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	542.3614884730586
We do not suffer by _accident_.	780.4145072456234
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."
	472.4570284258141
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	770.6125943404664
It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	860.7158323586959
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.	643.3861298029659
Bingley's
love?"
	679.8048892796321
"I never saw a more promising inclination.	795.5939707198677
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	576.8076046374379
Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	734.1632537423421
At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	693.4456910609749
Could there be
finer symptoms?	758.9632222846222
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
	816.7628999469013
Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	687.7731499505023
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	408.0223983614808
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."
	750.451355409794
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	623.2955302784106
"I hope," added Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	684.2013014163635
We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."
	666.655160368428
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr.	523.4421622146439
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	512.563487605164
Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.	693.6919211149047
Bingley
never stirs without him."
	758.9927680419709
"So much the better.	311.32626794735125
But does not Jane
correspond with the sister?	691.2711989121623
_She_ will not be able to help calling."
	340.81000159764795
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
	780.1478604141901
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	560.0774292177239
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.	728.6044679504236
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	668.6426009433488
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	598.9175765895167
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr.	611.4432573304388
Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs.	602.9066484274863
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	545.9412297012494
To Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	813.8169210267562
About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	690.6067222136062
They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	568.0531124978478
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.	649.3105055863833
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	733.6746265263938
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	728.2838309646412
On being made acquainted with the
present Mr.	629.3260873795028
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr.	714.9008798931559
Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	732.5944249097694
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
	672.89512939586
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly.	626.386565464378
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	657.9965870984064
Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	721.4346805444252
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	464.84590351938107
But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	545.3260803340723
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure.	666.265831012994
You must not disappoint your father."
	780.0315521327441
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
	807.4536474821347
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	525.2890376047893
I will take care of
myself, and of Mr.	575.3225132916514
Wickham too.	592.3640888758189
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."
	449.5889204596874
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
	490.8363337760162
"I beg your pardon.	485.43071255813504
I will try again.	728.2644461272968
At present I am not in love with
Mr.	467.9730188193518
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	598.2912050201975
I see the imprudence
of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr.	581.3002244191703
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	705.003439287016
In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	630.5711393902737
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	402.146681014802
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	415.49025015674687
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	463.3252933734146
In short,
I will do my best."
	707.0708960589419
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	604.4565091991221
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."
	692.1976752797714
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	649.5017967064385
But do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	544.5339532594246
It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	581.6691949036888
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	561.8738346251134
But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied."
	654.9409578201645
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	658.7720900898208
His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	556.9480737171924
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,
	628.4298839853135
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
	702.9548105118928
"_That_ you certainly shall."
	728.240822508087
Will you come and see me?"
	780.0619018015867
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
	623.7572114139525
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	516.2932361782174
Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."
	530.436776167529
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	696.7052269372638
Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."
	443.8490038369996
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	616.6293739620478
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	668.4349123480226
Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	608.3247793290708
Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	630.0418865678167
She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	614.7903058353163
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	767.1199611129738
It was Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	630.1719656191146
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	502.62606632869284
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	799.1453186086593
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline.	718.2866479470052
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	688.0931641673385
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."
	531.9286914598733
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	505.05493248327633
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.	541.5961387566406
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	830.621959366235
I enquired after their brother, of course.	630.9125713694582
He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr.	684.2949121837772
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	795.6876595213866
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	532.7787017246894
I wish I could see her.	559.8868604714567
My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	597.3070985955834
Hurst were going out.	728.2784910665329
I dare say I shall
soon see them here."
	711.7211544788696
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	648.8742366774109
It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr.	635.3974339221581
Bingley her sister's being in town.	254.91489294978345
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	567.1468392737281
She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	506.41925257645295
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer.	725.8186722909337
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	593.7921318665976
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
	728.3333569549205
her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
	757.4455929925958
been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	625.7442689311762
But, my
	592.3640888758189
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
	773.3862346452385
obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
	732.6336616730916
I do not at
	601.7713044113794
all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
	895.1675189597677
if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
	676.7087227614979
be deceived again.	895.1858294699307
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
	807.3834591988239
and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	640.3673869929104
she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
	317.2303024639815
she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
	896.2573256421283
not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
	427.42996274312134
altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
	799.8778922717764
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	618.2097989107297
I pity, though I
	592.3640888758189
cannot help blaming her.	895.3140603901545
she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
	669.9243776666929
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
	705.6353021622824
acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
	627.2274164747428
brother is the cause of it.	423.84429912116235
I need not explain myself farther; and
	795.613324774745
though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
	839.783783989493
feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
	712.8847698090539
deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
	650.3919096409336
feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	813.5241933037079
I cannot but wonder,
	728.2526347746856
however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
	752.2265052026171
all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	751.1513469946935
He knows of my
	727.8701917032711
being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
	705.2800119758703
persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	584.6873895272095
I cannot
	592.3640888758189
understand it.	610.4692233977752
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
	594.060890521022
be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
	509.99710785940687
duplicity in all this.	397.76415876503205
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
	766.776214646813
thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
	812.5763728409966
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	411.28667354944923
Let me hear
	679.8223698328422
from you very soon.	552.5794659385482
Miss Bingley said something of his never
	539.9505855227623
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
	746.0258796885352
with any certainty.	895.2534028787633
We had better not mention it.	686.5927705655182
I am extremely
	679.8195901065612
glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
	728.8449466130493
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	581.4790177065726
I am
	592.3640888758189
sure you will be very comfortable there.	485.8119466012035
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	644.9820751267534
She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	680.2436261456021
His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.	613.970569760329
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	690.521638361438
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	688.8603798430164
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	632.2021032484596
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	623.2785871273727
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	642.3859981430534
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	621.2502306016821
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	679.7244174383562
Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	705.9058680204863
But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	714.9759929827883
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	487.2480489199585
There can be no love in all this.	450.1839364218406
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	674.504424502729
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	795.6794985640053
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do.	675.7433187043641
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."
	616.3481066171219
CHAPTER IV.	592.3640888758189
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	752.9135565251793
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.	628.3494739703998
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	704.2568888868454
Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.	701.5754703678467
There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	690.8054967767812
The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	580.7053420800452
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	750.0284450364449
She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	621.8956717272561
The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	811.1556236140405
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	702.8521164823711
The farewell between herself and Mr.	598.3451403015421
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	660.97074211606
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	542.6635008301072
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	645.3852963176413
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William's too long.	559.1291633131873
He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	808.122482665992
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.	646.4794177074207
As they drove to Mr.	643.3694334962107
Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	666.1852397297795
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	631.4713503981748
All was joy and
kindness.	758.9632241282981
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	664.2310234060608
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	666.6348209620497
Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	672.2091572025092
Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	709.7941546483142
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	740.3699058420243
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?	522.0291442381629
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."
	539.8936631521686
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	673.5923538998051
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."
	573.1855315904413
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."
	450.69440344020416
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	357.7244020031228
I know no harm of her."
	524.0125488417867
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."
	744.7642793024211
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"
	577.6895718588739
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."
	805.0924218983484
If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"
	623.7416817211702
It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."
	835.7351456811659
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	661.6203059104868
_He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."
	816.5939721514402
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	624.3630028730427
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."
	377.1125845348328
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better.	628.7688446553425
I am sick of them all.	445.8030442825404
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."
	763.455594669523
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."
	745.1842102899298
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	579.3044990886717
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	743.3664861632567
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour.	798.2536769100906
What are men
to rocks and mountains?	795.6868727855422
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	638.91257313386
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	659.0200690833635
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	814.7914335294142
Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."
	735.6219560372323
CHAPTER V.	592.3640888758189
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	560.4625031589959
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	732.8886564749215
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	567.2284483439439
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	397.8233724467167
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	634.5870405968009
The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	837.4408576207159
Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	565.1963362257014
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	394.2625583020446
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	710.970018871462
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	655.1865622628608
They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	566.9528011818642
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	532.6068547053475
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	632.9792670340108
When Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte.	720.9808228209429
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.	692.7904769996509
After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr.	583.9779320459892
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	700.4709781175375
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	618.89038678411
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	838.5281906462913
He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	753.9236619053422
But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	708.223382466049
It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	774.5503390685775
From his garden, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	698.5891574506032
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	739.1312701631709
When Mr.	592.3640888758189
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	504.75754361534774
Collins joining
in, observed,
	728.2526336691179
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.	477.5308329662866
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	649.3892463426156
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	745.6361417731608
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.	691.4784093746823
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	772.4694476001042
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."
	515.2184544211962
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	520.8244536404873
She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."
	697.3012392730657
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	655.116387849766
She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr.	802.0357234557312
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings.	744.4349972922006
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	648.8744895289666
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,
	633.0677566583811
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	466.2676298012437
Make
haste, and come down this moment."
	603.9059290126844
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	635.0135615797445
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.	679.7842221913251
"I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!"
	624.0634307367781
"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine.	533.9823042358589
The old lady is Mrs.	643.3861298029659
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	518.6158514421332
The
other is Miss De Bourgh.	592.3640888758189
Only look at her.	406.79848405248123
She is quite a little
creature.	686.3355607975648
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"
	483.63976950072237
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	621.3494884571927
Why does she not come in?"
	686.6407252563373
"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	750.07416938938
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."
	619.1832157051633
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	728.2442053962442
"She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.	628.0962488461317
She will
make him a very proper wife."
	697.8104495872518
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	500.4232660451576
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.	560.2429134329212
CHAPTER VI.	592.3640888758189
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	675.5286782519579
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	539.7685398127404
Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!"
	655.4173990320805
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	722.0075959172814
About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."
	770.3757075918382
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings.	611.349271200759
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,
	618.3413203875549
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	760.5847954339984
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	531.980355411346
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	744.179796803624
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St.	634.821173852246
James's.	592.3640888758189
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr.	571.5998010805096
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	671.8610100673443
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	708.3238650731665
From the entrance hall, of which Mr.	707.1230721110114
Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs.	709.0405520143684
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	620.470442474266
Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	694.0821391498876
In spite of having been at St.	633.7201815932818
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	651.8327738751336
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	612.5803050037159
She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.	792.1014425379564
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	539.2645807891927
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr.	742.3730802925388
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	717.790984941242
There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	758.4666341222675
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.	715.3222238344177
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr.	433.5391570291741
Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	577.360487919205
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr.	760.9606624531731
Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	654.0578882763723
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	803.4577084245134
The party did not supply much conversation.	795.547648058931
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	607.0508432117437
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	793.6359996285031
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	616.3926556342824
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	579.3491896577142
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	562.8676559848547
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	674.7346988252074
Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	526.7746558505944
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
observed,
	631.5473778175032
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.	661.7031569861532
Collins, I think.	592.3640888758189
For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"
	616.4462229687383
"A little."
	592.3640888758189
"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	615.7689683487806
"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.	658.3187259011703
The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--Do you draw?"
	745.5942696883485
"No, not at all."
	205.0794119420095
"What, none of you?"
	544.3095472519531
"Not one."
	592.3640888758189
"That is very strange.	728.0622732890013
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	602.4999159989028
Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."
	847.0849174054189
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."
	644.0850556239795
"Has your governess left you?"
	758.9829202502245
"We never had any governess."
	651.0521664005129
"No governess! How was that possible?	679.7607694359001
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	535.7502628369572
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	495.4711827667312
"Then, who taught you?	728.2762576714733
who attended to you?	556.0159608956297
Without a governess you must
have been neglected."
	496.7946718284992
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	807.3950818467325
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	673.5121454835378
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	710.8293345496304
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	658.8177946471818
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way.	575.6274330426211
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	696.226993523467
Four nieces
of Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	594.7504471779007
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	707.0840064353511
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	634.5801792141453
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"
	638.7210857989437
"Yes, Ma'am, all."
	656.803401688604
"All!--What, all five out at once?	571.4675009916309
Very odd!--And you only the
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"
	679.9766309738541
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	780.0915985358954
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	763.5132487380722
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	606.6737219444796
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."
	610.21134977695
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"
	673.4766018323413
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
	669.3263869826844
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	680.5416295013237
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."
	639.938941194428
"I am not one and twenty."
	565.5139705649196
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	606.0618966372147
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	542.1021829522563
Jenkinson to make up her
party.	604.5165047225879
Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	687.7139177384698
Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	789.5123756399338
A great deal more passed at the
other table.	531.9470372800366
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	801.1700688280565
Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	786.6659796872193
Sir William did not say much.	640.8206723511825
He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	824.3563249699054
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	632.1443637869498
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	642.6215103003466
From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.	634.3756050924642
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	739.9660001347008
As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	514.4916662677664
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr.	612.0331634316639
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	623.7927071422688
CHAPTER VII.	592.3640888758189
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	687.5598661543078
While Sir William was with them, Mr.	563.245566126374
Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	660.256688768339
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	750.1002519118375
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr.	686.922001559777
Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	790.54844048065
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	698.6491432113819
Very few days passed in which Mr.	598.7289971875363
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	621.755970088753
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	641.1479922778921
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs.	672.4651139766819
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	685.7261495312875
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr.	677.6263131737734
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	808.0238039222995
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.	696.4799971716034
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	667.344770270049
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	622.6074451861377
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	792.0772750342405
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	632.8024200675745
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.	745.0914348610066
Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.	563.2739512998403
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.	698.7166649825065
Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	622.330559274396
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects.	602.0837156404681
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr.	679.8159148700265
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr.	567.8631193771212
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	780.0682475521804
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,
	765.7907336333699
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	728.2015407917224
Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."
	680.3806409199647
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	665.7971877728195
Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	722.0074613620526
Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs.	433.04982668028435
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	711.9761905255865
Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	456.18586788933
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs.	734.0866018660483
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	400.2386410223319
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family.	542.653929526858
She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,
	476.35258442687507
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	679.5134067486466
Have you never
happened to see her there?"
	507.26876106939767
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	469.86644083274354
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	620.0389733724686
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings.	608.6943015313385
It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	529.1446311035659
For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	557.9515157297047
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.	590.9533291157863
Darcy they had
only seen at church.	795.538724383673
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.	725.6951015084225
Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	481.5265734742514
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	611.4813196872335
Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	729.45969612684
He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr.	632.5793172245762
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,
	681.9833823998448
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	482.89501759593475
What is it you are talking
of?	581.5186831716007
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	634.4836906878937
Let me hear what it is."
	446.01028158613457
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	679.819590106562
It is of all subjects my delight.	795.8568601580247
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	643.8198453407732
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	772.5276582550161
If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient.	529.8882368168369
And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	669.1430262078948
I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	487.3853970030272
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"
	592.3640888758189
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	546.9798389979695
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."
	596.9733358598388
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	666.5444836830153
She practises very constantly."
	728.2762576714733
"So much the better.	311.32626794735125
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	731.8832004047617
I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	728.8107064430235
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs.	685.9108751537435
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs.	577.887094765573
Jenkinson's room.	526.6010087498785
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."
	455.48286087900743
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	473.3570504842493
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	643.2882144809722
He
drew a chair near her.	780.153109825237
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	780.538882694282
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,
	611.8372452919283
"You mean to frighten me, Mr.	679.7681241511143
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	700.8058523312163
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	572.6396075228155
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	690.0195065089584
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."
	707.201125018802
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	677.0992048122768
I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	666.0815616083742
Indeed, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."
	692.2817593396244
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	446.2770104095978
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.	474.5547832737038
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	587.5341477385851
He danced
only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	546.4046430084368
He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	710.9937762551174
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."
	635.2446214400406
Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	623.7572114139525
My fingers wait your orders."
	651.1894398435409
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."
	653.5153864147809
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	582.047638446731
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	576.448828099001
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."
	733.7543803118273
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	686.3276583194094
I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."
	798.2112916749996
They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	684.3925200469099
But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising.	548.4730803937812
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."
	744.5374979867322
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.	691.5947428630169
You have employed your
time much better.	673.7128318005812
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	798.7425912091143
We neither of us perform to strangers."
	673.7715742490983
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	758.9829202502245
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,
	496.6599194189841
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master.	632.9593195558224
She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	622.943338217588
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	564.7139332203483
Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	563.3339954285643
CHAPTER IX.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs.	575.3498633340973
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	694.9581765327387
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.	696.132403954892
Darcy, and Mr.	592.3640888758189
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	710.4463417104141
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	666.740927616509
It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,
	574.053086372304
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.	670.4962447657562
Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.	421.09643240567385
Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before.	642.2923762117247
"Perfectly so--I thank you."
	551.9797330831557
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,
	416.4817635248099
"I think I have understood that Mr.	628.3757497550578
Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"
	741.9844458986082
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	608.3759377651876
He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."
	743.7334321967137
But perhaps Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."
	643.6857950194949
Elizabeth made no answer.	230.29419607648816
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	529.1892046282429
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house.	637.0914484978758
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.	538.829589062592
Collins first came to Hunsford."
	643.3710122011759
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."
	548.7670457435212
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."
	606.5010644561306
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	633.3100738916374
My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.	702.1588063992168
Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	807.3701720880462
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."
	594.6592831695316
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."
	528.1938311143952
"An easy distance do you call it?	603.9675326552715
It is nearly fifty miles."
	758.9829202502245
"And what is fifty miles of good road?	807.482945508419
Little more than half a day's
journey.	498.43154669546834
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth.	572.1203956285534
"I should never have said Mrs.	598.2739659314922
Collins
was settled _near_ her family."
	483.3987448594564
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	542.292687626119
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
	739.894015566509
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	496.9243667901442
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	798.6836867293098
Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	745.243039881463
But that is not the
case _here_.	514.5645572230909
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	687.9628753781392
_You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."
	633.5454379224599
Elizabeth looked surprised.	679.8048892796321
The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,
	817.5142098748439
"Are you pleased with Kent?"
	643.377781986115
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	448.9111082606642
The tête-à-tête surprised
them.	615.0055789675569
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	582.8547007238127
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."
	497.45357480026684
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	642.9045122961905
All field sports were over.	758.9847824741537
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	707.2423388747796
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	684.2063840089073
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	674.5184104901348
But why Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	620.997173792081
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	698.0198605148998
He seldom appeared really
animated.	758.9927680419709
Collins knew not what to make of him.	352.9165101084091
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	607.6706812036356
He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	557.3722493864304
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	740.0546860279967
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	527.6357616833675
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	599.4515453929048
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.	694.3721121138894
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.	711.9025357620264
Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	578.0340667020216
CHAPTER X.	592.3640888758189
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	668.4450603349081
It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	713.9421792507986
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.	605.5831270944971
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	623.2752964375369
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	596.6771306486747
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	790.8538914947575
It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage.	538.8004730537028
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.	692.120181136459
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	728.2763736789173
Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,
	729.404225289005
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
	536.7748786104911
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	731.2642186080709
"No, I should have turned in a moment."
	477.39408529934354
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.	589.0732668858471
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	525.5389904307906
But I am at his disposal.	564.1267203346836
He
arranges the business just as he pleases."
	576.479968934859
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	598.0256299073709
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.	575.4424638314366
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	663.3734045647809
"But so we all do.	651.1503879718258
It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	699.9380150164689
I speak
feelingly.	679.8195901065612
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."
	703.99709987676
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either.	573.0788356611587
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	626.2916625528505
When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"
	808.0267984465831
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	684.3405597965362
But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	567.2632072183923
Younger sons cannot marry
where they like."
	713.1858531506939
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."
	731.3629472512162
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."
	782.0363129458052
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	672.7349716497725
Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
	638.5045766499085
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	597.8230580123361
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,
	669.0227639661254
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	627.9806001152149
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	624.9261806059467
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."
	595.9371033416531
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	563.988129470261
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."
	510.6011812212016
"Are you, indeed?	679.8195901065612
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?	670.4264039825251
Does your
charge give you much trouble?	795.6200987310312
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."
	646.847310589046
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	554.4882250852294
She directly replied,
	679.8195901065612
"You need not be frightened.	570.1486686123243
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	369.95847660080193
She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	551.0876941836943
I think I have heard you say that you know them."
	529.6462160560337
"I know them a little.	601.0174650412193
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."
	549.576883022409
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.	679.8122396533593
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."
	571.439977358168
"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.	616.9217061825203
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him.	589.6361082914683
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant.	576.5419342758422
"What is it you mean?"
	515.8078303490522
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."
	579.7134341393485
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
	530.8295533271505
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."
	675.750977855756
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"
	733.6887845242551
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
	816.7651997913637
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	604.7843560967019
"He
only told me, what I have now told you."
	624.7554207221489
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	574.4232177395294
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	620.6853033581764
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	464.24658938728356
Why was he to be the judge?"
	462.46758789491525
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
	816.7346348983446
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."
	318.0599266241755
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
	607.4900013427114
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr.	686.8249618775086
There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	415.7984198881846
It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	548.6417988066285
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.	605.125274929474
Darcy could have
such boundless influence.	780.0924680601136
That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr.	476.8004528629276
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	530.2277715786053
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	681.5800873649401
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.	723.0635840950015
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	650.5264099527656
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	691.4162099575434
Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.	782.7334437592851
Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.	664.4944997949524
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr.	553.3442458425892
Bingley for his sister.	329.0880127740042
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr.	823.7381679288652
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	658.5756262731055
Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	657.9816511749901
CHAPTER XI.	592.3640888758189
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr.	507.73503453223833
Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.	656.7167905630131
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	857.2386321069596
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	703.5221891866358
Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	727.5010280264777
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	477.2428385211922
It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	663.6774713089018
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	523.5053113312748
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.	724.6894138972428
Darcy walk into the
room.	261.45825174544143
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	695.5054734494987
She answered him with cold civility.	686.6266806741759
He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	441.925973420188
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	402.74618244928246
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,
	744.8947055115316
"In vain have I struggled.	592.3640888758189
It will not do.	485.4084910488527
My feelings will not be
repressed.	502.45566538968325
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."
	527.8799472805197
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	497.7683179038632
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	603.7839414739796
This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	635.102934901224
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	562.8928061874665
His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	748.8022997100846
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	591.98851232389
She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	706.5479556128737
He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	578.3158888319119
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	536.1272203344755
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	835.6673162238734
Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,
	740.96306188948
It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	722.6082454770371
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration.	741.1260352647694
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	672.3020007375155
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	691.6014121009586
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,
	714.5883035018377
But it is of small importance."
	565.790208155199
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	799.8340309977849
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	742.0548417122241
But I have
other provocations.	698.8028474319237
As she pronounced these words, Mr.	679.8195901065612
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	743.7264692208308
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	414.02389291349925
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	835.7930530978584
You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."
	689.0922809307888
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	708.6091021330446
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	397.983869179355
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.	541.9639607570329
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	593.7299469924691
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."
	744.9626265938656
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	708.8724542112532
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	708.8593840719553
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr.	738.6633234744373
On this subject, what can you have to
say?	489.86139210653874
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"
	829.2618302769308
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	681.2602420286273
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"
	695.5054958543225
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."
	663.2871300759758
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.	691.3740840554448
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	783.9635442813192
You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	457.3270567655251
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	803.9736840552746
You have done all this! and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."
	733.4268394984495
My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	804.7828165741481
These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	688.764348784376
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	807.5067499393256
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	596.6448488640217
They were natural and just.	758.9435266738712
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	667.7187375334028
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"
	651.8926670240578
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,
	678.839048461663
"You are mistaken, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."
	656.1567212271134
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,
	643.7670019036518
"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."
	552.5539114826918
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	530.5082219059989
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
	654.1449705372685
"You have said quite enough, madam.	780.127794735887
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."
	729.7280733198774
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	656.064459202705
She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	490.32680492777837
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr.	485.2300188212094
Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for
so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	496.18221613485537
But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.	552.2450677057675
Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	664.915555997823
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	587.1236907578399
She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	559.3043751344508
She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.	679.6909668998217
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	817.4405298142195
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	539.4973430247607
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	611.4893468211873
Darcy, she was directly retreating.	758.9800493551043
But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	614.1911805911944
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr.	588.4685659269858
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	654.3362396113158
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	657.7684092520018
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	733.3480444582955
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
	583.9130099693442
"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
	727.9431186014305
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
	895.2214390012756
or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
	839.8783060656168
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
	649.1255550208627
cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
	785.9010693430945
and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
	579.5749361481824
spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	614.0241584606828
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
	742.0723499909845
demand it of your justice.	894.8222092217264
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
	500.65799049692714
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	813.4581179010887
The first mentioned
	679.8195901065612
was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
	800.2400130175018
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
	511.98911771412014
ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.	824.3616734584821
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
	746.1774315258468
my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
	593.4132934814103
had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
	573.8666085787551
to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
	834.9512659902093
be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
	639.317030377274
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
	723.9325544860304
bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
	451.7663760094051
future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
	834.7866588932985
due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
	682.7790577619248
may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
	718.1641363915188
had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
	513.3620760824654
others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
	539.0257050280973
young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
	385.30136814309986
dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
	706.9438134590953
serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
	601.3760739172578
ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
	571.6998226079895
acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
	711.7519402103383
Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
	735.3916788530627
expectation of their marriage.	738.6715968427523
He spoke of it as a certain event,
	544.3180138004698
of which the time alone could be undecided.	894.8513140654876
From that moment I
	592.3640888758189
observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
	790.9092335806431
perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
	660.0035768060299
ever witnessed in him.	626.6386545407748
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
	623.7420354510629
manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
	805.3846119115129
symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
	790.5976166947789
evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
	829.2385694465627
pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
	677.5757553256884
sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
	616.594531818927
been in an error.	895.0666599141304
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
	634.145001599382
the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
	640.7412527313586
error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
	751.0364031517329
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
	651.9190296860132
of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
	561.7479861976175
the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
	828.587700655837
temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
	517.8539035865067
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
	739.2476342086602
indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
	698.77650162854
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
	728.229859525797
the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
	745.604688685617
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
	844.0728377698365
own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
	572.5310197159245
repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
	895.3527855291906
an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
	746.1039957008304
forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
	554.3740685006701
must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's
	625.7532080802357
family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
	484.15853720074017
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
	895.2951933920403
by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
	834.9654032283024
your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	631.195839170131
But amidst
	592.3640888758189
your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
	726.1047317579579
consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
	700.8217404829213
avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
	812.8907102708306
bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
	649.13918753475
the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
	807.0245214762049
from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
	639.241049048127
confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
	895.3300181424099
before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
	710.5381539930632
connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
	621.246323263186
returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
	637.6823005359793
sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
	828.9190511581462
coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
	895.2300944823808
that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
	668.5874362537855
resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
	745.1368736033679
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
	723.7955861873321
my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
	603.459569946928
enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
	780.1562129443613
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
	696.3224512185682
seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
	807.0483874413783
sister's indifference.	693.1808595677901
He had before believed her to return his
	733.5709798490275
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
	770.4126149370862
great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
	829.148669140574
than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
	553.0013621347707
himself, was no very difficult point.	895.2098808425787
To persuade him against
	728.2644461272968
returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
	685.2057232632025
was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
	653.1074952460966
having done thus much.	895.2587070163753
There is but one part of my conduct in the
	486.0744191520451
that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
	588.6191550434565
conceal from him your sister's being in town.	422.44273235609637
I knew it myself, as
	758.9139828333703
it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
	557.7415976211018
of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
	746.0743096131075
perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
	636.2161080539361
extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
	537.1801145157299
concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
	790.989414118956
to say, no other apology to offer.	719.2805102058044
If I have wounded your sister's
	611.5377214100099
feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
	705.478065523786
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
	799.9112324829669
not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
	687.448191783541
weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.	780.1072553088559
Wickham, I can only
	656.7927483294357
refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
	582.1181100778105
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
	651.7633235446751
of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
	500.83298788474735
witness of undoubted veracity.	895.3576278185939
Wickham is the son of a very
	450.8238215863772
respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
	508.7877478831679
Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
	644.902446975839
trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
	575.660118834906
George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
	746.0096068134361
liberally bestowed.	895.3721494065021
My father supported him at school, and
	795.627469596548
afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
	602.2024750041465
father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
	732.9368419931313
been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	634.7626835841955
My father was not
	728.207712122604
only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
	670.8520504367466
engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
	626.6649603158124
church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	600.9946703991816
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
	651.4666312118276
of him in a very different manner.	449.0627739472659
The vicious propensities--the
	728.2762576714733
want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
	781.5312501466851
of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
	423.1976380617978
of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
	762.169870825924
seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.	603.9374029945151
Darcy could not have.	369.505428519196
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	732.1295674070387
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.	601.0903328252892
Wickham has created, a
	728.2644461272968
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
	895.0791948887377
It adds even another motive.	758.9927680419709
My excellent father
	679.8048892796321
died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.	661.8789413179269
Wickham was to
	679.7532624533847
the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
	894.602473531062
to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
	665.9848132584651
profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
	702.478606962352
valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
	497.09505623190455
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	489.90588829202306
His own
	592.3640888758189
father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
	895.2008361379785
events, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
	807.4646072623772
resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
	627.5215742660768
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
	764.0281770777467
advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
	460.9371148693022
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
	763.5122575638657
be a very insufficient support therein.	736.9856373874827
I knew that Mr.	592.3640888758189
Wickham ought not to be a
	233.060891406565
The business was therefore soon settled.	780.149467327818
He resigned all
	679.8195901065612
claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
	564.4335234011618
ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
	771.6070579128658
thousand pounds.	345.5273814871395
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	795.6735188701508
thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
	538.2201982322257
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
	843.9331380110565
restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	895.1181414750976
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
	468.07309291745554
to me again by letter for the presentation.	813.258514772748
His circumstances, he
	679.8195901065612
assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
	583.8690998401678
exceedingly bad.	895.3431064662041
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
	816.5961229119478
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
	649.1346374247297
present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
	627.4698861560755
father's intentions.	895.1156500324585
comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	678.0316666571431
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
	600.7682994860669
to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	773.7787156613532
appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	895.2603405577746
How he lived I know not.	634.5566268121353
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	834.8570687098259
must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
	719.5629660017421
me to unfold to any human being.	895.2409050364165
Having said thus much, I feel no
	666.5766718397513
About a year ago, she was taken from
	733.7097448761481
school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
	799.821452213611
summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
	783.7802972368554
and thither also went Mr.	759.5926721665877
proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	452.224068900716
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
	830.4372016314709
her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
	830.4257340741487
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
	747.4202242669518
kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
	524.0248367440074
She was then but
	728.1226495383889
fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
	829.1937027933642
imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
	569.4280313344206
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
	586.6992596648638
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
	771.7613116549923
You may imagine what I felt
	634.5801792141446
and how I acted.	542.8753373514547
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
	675.3148815737045
prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.	711.7519402103392
Wickham, who left
	679.8195901065612
the place immediately, and Mrs.	757.9345424662267
Younge was of course removed from
	595.1731293857965
her charge.	894.5285970883618
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
	713.2019272714804
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
	745.6471521675184
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	524.9302732693492
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
	784.0911935947868
have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
	433.90093708125045
it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
	808.4829862177526
towards Mr.	592.3640888758189
I know not in what manner, under what form of
	700.8233890957235
falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
	895.1474067012168
be wondered at.	895.2245522338898
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
	506.5957393740386
concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
	563.1652108345342
suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	895.1150850753428
You may possibly
	679.8195901065612
wonder why all this was not told you last night.	554.7777540911145
But I was not then
	698.8137139467852
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
	506.2680903661575
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
	758.5101175468482
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
	719.8246319478142
with every particular of these transactions.	895.214127779628
If your abhorrence of
	728.2644461272968
_me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
	796.9320575503967
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
	647.266974568198
be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
	570.2943105381463
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
	685.1780743961563
of the morning.	240.88804036538556
I will only add, God bless you.	666.5581372926194
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."
	592.3640888758189
CHAPTER XIII.	592.3640888758189
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	722.1932261706851
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	707.1949460528514
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	671.3931992219241
With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield.	649.7904021058059
She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	722.7878990545167
His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	656.9137909812218
He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	648.2719996381786
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.	608.6045230469119
Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	798.0825574069074
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	598.0303265545551
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	613.7651639071264
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.	533.4658545486332
Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	670.7670310299276
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	600.8587532198353
What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	548.7074413811521
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	808.6956210163519
She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	717.510805579057
Again she read on.	544.3878288519561
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr.	713.2762441908062
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	724.4895704939419
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	757.3725055192352
She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	616.7721768133451
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	757.799485805771
His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	736.838120890051
She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.	796.0217998550906
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.	750.9892083467911
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	835.6480135771936
But no
such recollection befriended her.	780.1410235996434
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	728.8873251578943
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	762.1779741771296
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	637.2674769800523
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.	700.0814055056403
Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	479.43257496754114
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.	694.2273399823076
Philips's.	592.3640888758189
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	707.0017438773175
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	698.8978634550219
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr.	551.4727140460418
Darcy--that Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week.	657.868032916832
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.	689.4834274305853
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	732.9040250192983
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	672.3954335179802
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	742.0253897080127
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.	729.5439368436475
Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr.	366.5033876784891
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	657.8738354249829
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr.	658.6386137443641
Bingley, was incomprehensible.	679.8195901065612
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	552.2761970283686
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	661.5467577729623
But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	682.9719855961138
Till this moment, I never knew myself."
	666.5766718397521
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.	639.6200641221436
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	746.8821138391676
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	534.9751905373313
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	753.4281455230679
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	447.05946461678
It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	559.6973415547568
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	689.5797150588877
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr.	680.1658484408194
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	684.7289850717419
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	521.5244612804119
She could think only of her letter.	603.9917004670082
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.	462.590170681437
To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	588.0980901261103
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	760.7483164884868
His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."
	634.5870405968009
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,
	613.2012148130157
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	581.9499737361368
Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."
	467.17293049195894
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	696.1072910725652
I expected
you to stay two months.	713.0428452082947
I told Mrs.	592.3640888758189
There
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	469.3485615802643
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."
	807.4493838990575
"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."
	753.7330042452044
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	787.0290007687272
And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
	535.2683434419276
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."
	738.3288084922671
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	656.8140542234568
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	525.5611154170552
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	643.7290232944385
It is highly improper.	728.2762576714733
You must contrive to send
somebody.	780.1325821617584
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.	626.8366712601049
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
am excessively attentive to all those things.	601.6310993255772
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs.	451.33916114670006
I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."
	669.7677413781156
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."
	632.6567471233155
"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	673.461046150704
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	615.4717901820094
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	702.3401987091875
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	672.5833797980855
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	764.97043048966
When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	743.0796785598145
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	578.2829223388155
In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	581.7988180115141
They were hopeless of remedy.	758.9829202502245
Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	792.7858830899397
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	621.502696187365
Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	777.968292343431
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	686.670227262588
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	644.7045995568773
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	617.5314698393998
His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	702.1232004248367
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!
	682.4167518765278
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	481.77621960614346
The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	651.6656561479576
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	625.9312945034375
CHAPTER XV.	592.3640888758189
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	679.7567618509812
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.	620.1791545110448
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	609.6092140157499
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	844.0912057121989
Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."
	627.6356411586435
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	824.3375437940872
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,
	673.9232492308108
"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	609.4038896733751
We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	759.6535176896938
You see on
what a footing we are.	807.3649230150021
You see how continually we are engaged there.	733.6923416582433
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	626.0777635454342
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	697.5539201590348
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	366.27554953700087
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	666.570494178392
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	713.0366073361578
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	635.1241069043115
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	764.9133160315399
We seem to have been designed for each
other."
	320.4583969617946
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	628.3329658049113
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	747.5382352718626
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	709.6025082261259
After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr.	701.2908903197829
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr.	653.6237540580732
Gardiner, though unknown.	679.8195901065612
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	614.3088827873236
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."
	749.8406472681716
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	655.3053663095914
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"
	568.0620500239565
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	824.2376236103187
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"
	664.5786790302371
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."
	618.3695955918282
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.	780.0117017974803
Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	468.07407598861687
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	732.419973427965
But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	656.79623458077
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.	640.090550901574
To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	579.1988536041245
CHAPTER XVI.	592.3640888758189
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.	639.2129305923389
Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	698.3130853657293
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	761.8113621127364
is not this an agreeable surprise?"
	601.2236775413988
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	471.5328130092076
I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."
	658.8417615790942
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable.	670.2677083982968
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."
	604.6013774934607
"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	545.5601196225149
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	632.3954540190252
Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"
	660.1334104045403
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	625.2514855347993
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."
	775.5644989047332
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.	513.3765304133519
"What do you think?	430.1049184961031
It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."
	805.1319549056883
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	624.5519139218749
Lydia laughed, and said,
	452.39152871865986
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	816.827142891153
You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say.	627.8494255173872
But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone.	622.3269362287601
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	469.1527398913074
Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	725.5014325067697
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	643.32585660388
There's for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	605.3259849283887
Wickham is safe."
	679.8048892796321
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."
	701.609342208995
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
	621.5857731826561
"I am sure there is not on _his_.	587.8538461003235
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	835.7328502582372
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!
	819.4325283613351
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	710.1314294713458
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	728.2381098206872
"I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	638.3539689964142
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	511.02536955130324
Have you seen any pleasant men?	780.1884493453204
Have you had any
flirting?	758.8431623236174
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	625.5651219553791
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	600.3149287853048
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	676.8049409164095
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	456.80245389272903
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	571.5019639506784
Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	622.0819484871236
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs.	646.5009050020423
Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs.	486.44742131884664
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	632.1776639137859
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	575.9172654903919
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	656.646435493258
I thought I should have died.	679.6892983436317
And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
	655.4439723154436
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn.	684.4072694565851
Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	522.7457795767646
Their reception at home was most kind.	795.5714699550132
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.	607.6571734643451
Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,
	643.3861298029659
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	682.4872072729456
Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	615.2478221023404
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	649.7984128640858
I was ready to die of laughter.	648.8469978474902
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"
	734.4384561216991
They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	774.4325785681415
But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	704.027978014855
I should infinitely prefer a book."
	686.6465491141266
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	436.4440727525917
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	497.4006724909759
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	550.7696436685072
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	453.9032229109115
There was
another reason too for her opposition.	807.3254891251714
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	568.9249515219745
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	647.8898176812983
In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	597.095026135822
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	641.9544299136895
Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	583.9352736004947
CHAPTER XVII.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.	540.7664751977662
Darcy and herself.	395.8253471003167
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	792.8274068996845
She was
sorry that Mr.	643.3861298029659
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	671.8613733251267
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."
	745.3866798598131
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	688.7466656182692
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
	689.0912841032663
"Blame you! Oh, no."
	592.3640888758189
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."
	583.1010901907111
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
	454.6898489508816
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham.	511.0483147225756
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	742.3928476675857
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	677.2478620142905
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	683.7989605001421
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.	518.7217839243723
"You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	430.1807120515425
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	718.0732195821652
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.	563.8871339484767
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."
	696.9458531208056
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.	424.7103436908286
"Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief.	711.6861861433938
And poor Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy! dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	609.526234617249
Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of
his sister! It is really too distressing.	622.0329922729629
I am sure you must feel it
so."
	461.71585273201316
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	779.2506834117999
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	711.677897620013
Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."
	722.6606178552825
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner."
	664.5767515112232
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."
	489.54626964847364
"I never thought Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."
	564.948713412586
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	723.7171524298072
One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."
	790.211384813471
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."
	551.8230575098619
"Indeed I could not.	657.3666045809017
I was uncomfortable enough.	601.3582743672022
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	691.5012891380445
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"
	620.7571519331696
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr.	564.3063498023997
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."
	807.507091278667
There is
one point, on which I want your advice.	648.261052137461
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	532.0269090371104
What is your own opinion?"
	758.7773954653289
"That it ought not to be attempted.	400.86362818728276
Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	714.6125380409414
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	492.7964458147875
The general prejudice against Mr.	643.3861298029659
Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	567.4476981597834
I am not equal to it.	484.67190405596136
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	622.5822770042514
"You are quite right.	601.340611824053
To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	685.8334886669877
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	605.7776090819591
We must not make him desperate."
	686.487181935932
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	667.5316184046402
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	718.0655564511433
But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	724.3220961687615
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	482.1273468712176
Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	686.0123679103617
"And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	703.4972801415464
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"
	844.0063512795432
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	526.0136660194055
Jane was not happy.	728.2904137388628
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	705.9834094566962
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's?	673.9842441632651
For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	660.6104393309852
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	416.54113357757114
Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	517.4002396258106
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."
	538.5964254189262
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."
	537.2913972626101
"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	634.5996506703221
Nobody wants him to come.	442.6829249384242
Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."
	522.9267285763659
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	590.0552699895125
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	730.9358597128837
Well, well, I only hope it
will last.	609.3918017378547
And what sort of table do they keep?	646.577717438127
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say.	597.890077974642
If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	746.7377507013018
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."
	648.227015304022
"No, nothing at all."
	231.66379008795016
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	454.15963140359924
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	659.183886906184
_They_ will never be distressed
for money.	673.6925612964286
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."
	731.3704657333249
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
	586.1597729669663
It would have been strange if they had.	426.52187569978094
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	575.5906514782682
The first week of their return was soon gone.	816.4482307314407
The second began.	679.8195901065612
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	482.2705968700569
The dejection was almost
universal.	758.9650848088767
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	704.6444009444315
Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	589.1262101031266
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	707.4251184116284
"How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"
	576.6090623017657
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	681.4307473297162
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar's regiment went away.	595.1307903467102
I thought I should have broke my heart."
	728.137250921236
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.	649.3198669132918
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."
	570.5045289306972
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."
	618.5816938728833
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.	484.63231869407974
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	810.3788319705457
She felt anew the justice of Mr.	598.7890001219923
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	548.6293645475329
A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	579.0504058583392
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.	619.2908044034261
Forster,
the delight of Mrs.	552.0029585398223
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	726.9160864306003
"I cannot see why Mrs.	643.3694334962107
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.	605.8552947282002
I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."
	754.3191990800638
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned.	505.31233935380516
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	626.922165782154
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs.	667.5750673415902
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	577.3087569321245
He heard her attentively, and then said,
	603.8609841353108
"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."
	724.8758834922138
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."
	664.3405429999826
"Already arisen!" repeated Mr.	592.3640888758189
Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	740.261472687307
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."
	740.9278628891635
"Indeed you are mistaken.	385.5691261469207
I have no such injuries to resent.	795.5642740504076
It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	731.3550499964077
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character.	643.6049501731794
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.	666.5654842961706
If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	512.7731580935232
Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	710.3743856751829
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	837.1483329471168
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended.	666.5581372926194
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	634.5870405968009
Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"
	656.1781460032744
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,
	577.7640663287455
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	485.18955452958915
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters.	631.6460748948798
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton.	686.4072627694791
Let her go then.	728.2526336691179
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	601.4753382683634
At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	604.51094997937
The officers will find
women better worth their notice.	816.8041945492739
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	843.8409725547403
At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."
	566.5127868249601
It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	542.4701671133378
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	659.5192784315843
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	710.1127084659157
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	854.9529577360411
She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	685.0761449929353
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	788.9084872466167
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	742.1361558621898
They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	626.2526402769631
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.	577.3532093585522
Elizabeth was now to see Mr.	598.18014248417
Wickham for the last time.	515.6369528202704
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	733.7499108565935
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	838.0076470140351
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	762.000716288003
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	761.0729816873579
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.	548.1253732066846
Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	624.1590721300169
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	546.1956433551281
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	630.836825025193
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?"
	433.5353142904335
"Nearly three weeks."
	526.6010087498785
"Yes, almost every day."
	349.122225864337
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."
	587.7518339308887
But I think Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy improves on acquaintance."
	728.2644461272968
"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	588.5674412427283
"And pray
may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
address that he improves?	714.940710875542
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	783.9929163111088
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.	592.3640888758189
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."
	628.6033603519588
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	751.8473714814388
There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,
	708.1442426609054
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
	733.7614662763986
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,
	668.0782459141276
"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.	745.0506068424245
Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	671.4398266086005
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	783.6063383521232
I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	720.7646467308432
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart."
	649.4769483553682
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	576.2195859966462
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	591.0040634256777
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	670.309006275275
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	649.2710205633206
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	567.2049618344637
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	667.4741448458923
Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	691.4013874795787
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	589.1196874142198
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	645.3469706061832
Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	730.0861206760798
He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	699.453101219242
This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	727.4758383744253
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	531.9422321332689
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	769.9431337042305
But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	764.3020655605903
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	621.0878592812628
Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	784.2659458531456
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	722.0786047687553
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	568.1477303730189
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	567.6775695112896
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	763.5247849978531
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	748.201588353056
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."
	778.0250773942633
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	696.8069897191452
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs.	606.519789678608
Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	674.7174832856168
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.	745.4085934721801
Everything wore
a happier aspect.	758.9730725862514
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.	669.8848580841977
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs.	685.171899722491
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	830.612534943589
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs.	575.0912153086081
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	795.6652917844951
The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.	626.481691824688
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	706.1145655210748
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	717.7907927667301
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	584.7812918512676
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
	791.6351149406885
The period of expectation was now doubled.	795.4840436963642
Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	529.590355142697
But they did pass away, and Mr.	707.0903040266597
and
Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn.	770.4086279820924
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	776.995140421688
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	616.8600988295576
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.	578.1922093729079
are
sufficiently known.	895.5552591742543
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern.	674.2652632393743
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.	621.0338671292633
Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	703.853144359083
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	654.7290667778944
Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	580.9828072189831
Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	683.9819592179315
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	711.3945435951957
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."
	636.2839724461609
Elizabeth was distressed.	526.6351722320229
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	508.8126599206082
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	719.3038404519485
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	728.2762576714733
"If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	695.9901858139908
They have some of the finest woods in the
country."
	420.8404646123412
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	601.4794532463629
The
possibility of meeting Mr.	643.3042010569862
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	795.6450169195708
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	622.4976147278448
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	629.8855939853323
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	535.4840200224387
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	347.0434138146467

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	599.0929924656292
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	715.3032960353876
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	810.5629019414814
They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	770.0419898084043
It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	793.905693616313
Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	807.5136396328123
Elizabeth was delighted.	526.612397396842
She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	724.9042277423076
They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
	588.0090808508768
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	672.3867155045468
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	733.4057498860095
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	637.393131454529
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	768.2781392380545
They
followed her into the dining-parlour.	390.66136776296815
It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	733.6302242254819
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	791.9937892814985
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	826.4939467445851
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	746.8953401413152
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	773.5429183083581
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	772.7895432164199
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."
	564.3665671708555
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	783.9117589575819
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	707.9953426910968
At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	654.8746835893571
Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
	620.59168878263
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	714.500133077585
She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr.	728.2053774580287
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	733.7356275387865
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	816.7991027732697
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."
	593.5671125047857
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.	517.7575548205475
"And that," said Mrs.	592.3640888758189
It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."
	527.2873187943188
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.	686.4760104478644
But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."
	807.5919243445481
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	786.9215027211404
"Does that young lady know Mr.	598.276394875263
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"
	525.8321081379779
"Yes, very handsome."
	679.790187394607
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	740.3277817587947
This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	750.704512802195
He was very fond of them."
	383.36885285441906
Wickham's being among them.	758.8801506031203
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.	577.5565843399801
In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."
	772.1425815964677
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	769.6602114890356
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	570.0385003763438
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
	403.5067914609866
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."
	601.1854624671425
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."
	656.8272530709509
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
	617.1761451019385
Gardiner smiled.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."
	448.6142017479906
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	572.2734473657197
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old."
	677.1712978124901
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	746.9523354413501
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	569.5359645947236
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,
	595.5325916776326
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	667.4430902098024
You are lucky in
having such a master."
	733.4608975606225
"Yes, Sir, I know I am.	592.3640888758189
If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better.	667.3888339518332
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."
	598.9219458976357
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.	649.3105055863833
Darcy!" thought she.	679.7691328467378
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	728.1285751625783
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."
	666.8719624808517
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	750.0101282268479
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	807.4084912085231
She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	662.7165689015117
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	738.8734491303788
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	676.2918757037617
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	661.7507272885375
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	673.2793352592031
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."
	586.860765698684
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.	718.6089105038345
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."
	685.4389836611393
"Perhaps we might be deceived."
	758.5268158721535
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."
	763.4809632853811
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley.	706.4440004517872
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	544.0686858113714
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	520.6990841097246
There
is nothing he would not do for her."
	450.2521176709087
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	576.383904295168
In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	729.5561327574447
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	706.0221423238997
Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	536.8337758062747
At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.	656.1809125320011
Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	606.9513326838646
She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	795.6442602198633
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	511.19823596444456
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	641.400452112998
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.	707.0774561208924
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	780.1322609404417
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	835.6211576580135
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	691.4065792974028
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	758.1121610135991
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	541.101038957192
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	804.6693186419884
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	720.3154248878943
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr.	754.5646057049217
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	810.4931584988863
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	638.3748733797308
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	663.5829526653105
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	694.4347516597934
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	710.308892651387
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	583.0975264858331
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	581.6489219493252
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?	659.3924167418821
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	693.3415250335238
Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	634.9999894841214
She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	516.037730646796
That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	754.1548157614287
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	601.009588349401
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.	674.9731179080119
Darcy then
was.	679.790187394607
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	490.3848785433981
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	705.613988560229
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	627.5879583930025
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	652.12866760362
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	762.6157275613033
Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	655.125832202224
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	669.4598266896189
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	716.9033688085744
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	786.8037555808993
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	655.5127558742718
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	700.9599501151001
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.	524.9747412788394
Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	807.3514697844327
The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	664.045110725559
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	722.7939079739215
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	560.0914668922346
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	804.4382746043499
With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	699.1001028463385
Her colour
changed, and she said no more.	444.5357063142868
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	574.0921744450459
"What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
fashion."
	782.2742241054722
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	646.321963010036
That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr.	690.2078299108829
Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	481.7765747559201
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	606.8776091108474
She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	789.193513886899
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.	759.1429626307939
Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	626.4202749478264
Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	720.6817094667095
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	765.0917657547783
Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	741.2898455839703
From
what can it proceed?	758.9869142555119
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	603.3886008536542
It is impossible that he should still love
me."
	516.8573891421476
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	658.7155775808742
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	587.4980607522759
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	675.4992583073257
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	531.4445937758207
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.	774.6599286973287
Bingley and his sisters."
	339.56915578286015
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	425.0944148591076
Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr.	623.1187838107196
Bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	687.6426440765314
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"
	670.0514989820998
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	599.1852317329464
She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	606.6583326812854
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	540.0748634368877
Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	714.6082029067077
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	638.0593580439557
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr.	526.7089433248999
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	681.8852679819958
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	673.088769927006
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	607.9194698102367
She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	784.0533514732095
At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance.	511.8561273492178
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	764.5307389902471
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	540.5324363478054
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	494.7440318107164
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	722.6816409038527
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	615.5138780508629
I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it."
	652.0132992931921
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	460.2408234913123
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	625.7522063443712
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	695.8241803240772
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."
	797.2078047805473
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	642.5352609733006
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.	628.5091853610962
He has not an ill-natured
look.	713.0800669733867
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	609.49224869402
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	645.0388570105757
But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."
	660.3221133551115
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	536.159464902218
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	561.2348207809484
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	622.4912155128742
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.	609.4359618348813
Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	620.1891786334905
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.	598.3322007214704
Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	581.1777368306008
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	674.7604087398809
They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	654.8301014025482
Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	833.8528653671714
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	685.1840955817809
While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	747.8849325369371
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	589.5641667789175
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	716.8709248268965
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	666.143769654755
Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	518.351214239584
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	843.9364796032397
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	771.723089032524
She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	662.8479526511243
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.	725.1714501525662
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	487.7340439811794
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	614.2054768812609
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	668.2256165625686
They had long wished to see him.	462.76705915649984
The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	824.2918480126451
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr.	728.2951653097178
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	804.0848814582545
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	663.0852156796547
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	616.871538840977
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	704.3168477834213
But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	512.6279200835713
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	618.583968979914
On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	673.076835859387
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months.	513.1810875727771
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
	690.0957957235427
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	662.6344373985161
There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	583.2304423494445
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.	568.8731208300858
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	746.3109229692343
When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	650.0073424362289
Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.	759.8164464016418
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr.	488.35881458390014
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr.	705.0696988557675
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	662.4575878320167
Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	742.7708172951089
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	533.9881143730779
Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	636.0807024481022
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	619.1425731125826
But she had no reason to fear Mr.	340.4198902629706
Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	571.403738055827
Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	321.70844713928795
They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	707.1986745262134
Of Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	561.7634594887214
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr.	673.7740249801469
There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	686.8380055045963
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	701.6769590815829
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	736.517124498359
It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	613.4226324561237
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr.	610.5222027701552
Darcy afterwards discharged.	679.8195901065612
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	689.2509937541989
She
certainly did not hate him.	780.0360267021969
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	705.511942495787
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	721.1479463679137
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	610.2672133397004
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	778.9244583483894
Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	644.509546426831
She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	662.572680362122
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning.	545.8932531781962
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	644.9665455152096
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	614.9162607059993
The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	598.9455138356655
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	634.0070151252075
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	733.5902950212505
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	711.7422467691307
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs.	682.4368730564257
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London.	675.4288402267608
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	830.4912549645665
By Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	653.15053674128
It was first broken by Mrs.	679.8048885916195
Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs.	667.4678165008557
Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	742.041710978828
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	602.1584086498718
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention.	457.12999815508175
Her own thoughts were employing her.	780.144672160903
She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	446.9465863799136
She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	749.5717013482176
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	526.2663437431505
She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	570.6890005664278
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs.	718.3967901907253
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	638.398545802278
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	733.722045584504
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.	683.3613475260875
Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	679.2512936634789
Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning.	602.6898760547917
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	585.7424847675538
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr.	671.6167461444969
Darcy were by no means over.	422.94098383676106
Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	513.6559578934313
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,
	667.7951715276442
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	666.5202976845308
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	688.4490926154621
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	608.8104451521452
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement.	739.8995454759896
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	717.1822938702878
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	652.5624037953162
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	666.2079391053043
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	688.8232712579008
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr.	733.6524715361437
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	668.8859672100731
But Georgiana would not join
her.	728.2923506265327
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	645.0185392018134
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	399.2898468122055
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.	620.1884966307096
Darcy," she cried; "I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	557.6180388709498
However little Mr.	592.3640888758189
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her.	654.6859134554107
Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	691.8254068411028
Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	663.4167615454077
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."
	616.0531904238981
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	648.28847817102
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,
	744.9644987739835
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."
	644.7236439444483
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
	612.1523309414705
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	579.0209643060488
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.	563.6449512323328
Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs.	535.9215732712531
CHAPTER IV.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	651.0721647167201
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	772.5267698284538
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	639.4823428095236
The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	810.3688806520636
It was to this effect:
	408.7273093775795
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
	728.2762576714733
a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
	644.8188678206883
you--be assured that we are all well.	669.8425419133201
What I have to say relates to
	635.2425187609987
poor Lydia.	592.3640888758189
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
	774.5842583239779
all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
	566.6686205300549
gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
	576.8658628102507
with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	643.3861298029659
To Kitty, however, it does not
	458.26174302210836
I am very, very sorry.	758.9555122291164
So imprudent a
	679.8048892796321
match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
	577.2795850185997
his character has been misunderstood.	646.6451276340866
Thoughtless and indiscreet I
	592.3640888758189
can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
	844.0090595598591
marks nothing bad at heart.	768.1882473181787
for he must know my father can give her nothing.	829.1458646575122
How thankful am I,
	592.3640888758189
that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
	797.3248192067206
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
	691.6227883723086
is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
	895.2766145815223
The express was sent off directly.	604.3735130198962
My dear Lizzy, they must
	643.3193284161019
have passed within ten miles of us.	730.1745514772565
Colonel Forster gives us reason
	698.8028474319237
to expect him here soon.	895.14351617111
I must conclude, for I cannot be
	564.4299472719342
long from my poor mother.	658.9260351720254
I am afraid you will not be able to make
	218.81634324646194
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	600.6757680424311
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
	774.5637504475902
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
	719.4268885574077
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
	757.5069717803732
for being coherent.	895.0811473029506
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
	539.2971013373824
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	584.3055461481284
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.	679.6247641135876
Wickham and our poor Lydia
	643.377781986115
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
	847.3709096375692
there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	423.8531490629859
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
	550.2227898583641
Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
	698.7937805933402
that W.	592.3640888758189
was repeated to Colonel F.	698.7229418413444
who instantly taking the alarm, set off
	802.4445403117045
from B.	592.3640888758189
intending to trace their route.	895.2930212185885
Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
	830.5644772069813
into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
	895.2622396382112
from Epsom.	592.3640888758189
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
	671.9471439521595
to continue the London road.	553.5723402104455
I know not what to think.	294.996873521757
After making
	592.3640888758189
every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	745.1684026681169
came on into
	693.602061829623
Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
	763.3210541330872
the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
	683.6411708103591
people had been seen to pass through.	679.1889913304354
With the kindest concern he
	758.9829202502245
most creditable to his heart.	767.9892590148384
I am sincerely grieved for him and
	639.1908334345472
but no one can throw any blame on them.	468.7304981847812
Our distress, my
	679.8195901065612
dear Lizzy, is very great.	698.5478861139211
My father and mother believe the worst,
	617.2444946159409
but I cannot think so ill of him.	311.1331206279204
Many circumstances might make it
	758.8844207788399
against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
	554.0164668707862
I grieve to
	679.8195901065612
find, however, that Colonel F.	698.7937805933402
marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
	580.797005758594
feared W.	592.3640888758189
was not a man to be trusted.	358.6176504726958
My poor mother is really ill
	780.1478649252638
and keeps her room.	669.9624496362356
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
	509.6573998306657
this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
	288.2997249672073
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
	750.0533098566434
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
	474.82491379248853
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
	494.9408027454144
something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
	751.0077624080529
is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	714.6556654560707
I am not so
	544.2082215530824
selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	895.4566428856374
take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
	731.022659846776
but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
	791.9561334022218
you all to come here, as soon as possible.	375.72475400267086
I know my dear uncle and
	566.158417700821
aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
	594.8129820813301
still something more to ask of the former.	681.0033370666783
My father is going to
	515.9260974166131
London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	728.2110000894222
he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
	690.4450304924108
will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
	727.968493734141
way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
	539.9217283423769
to-morrow evening.	693.294743253885
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
	696.8686034209817
assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
	500.94062072614423
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."
	642.9598110981143
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr.	707.8503494810436
Darcy appeared.	592.3640888758189
Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	721.2658621092997
I must find Mr.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."
	715.0014417530991
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.	710.5913069490279
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."
	750.0502884937916
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	733.6348111681256
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	831.6615513413998
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid.	583.333271357291
Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
ill."
	698.1047412785875
"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	790.9346263827565
"There
is nothing the matter with me.	473.14241041282236
I am quite well.	544.349164874064
I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."
	701.5686662585024
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	542.6700959385482
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	801.4509433378978
At length, she spoke again.	758.8844078647763
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news.	570.9753055505064
It cannot be concealed from any one.	581.5654441283265
My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr.	705.5734974050503
They are gone off together
from Brighton.	707.0880798602803
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	579.3021173958896
She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."
	658.1833135125303
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	758.9749347860186
"When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was.	588.0158872266304
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	511.46093833607705
But it is all, all too late now."
	675.7269448236473
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.	691.6227883723086
But is it
certain, absolutely certain?"
	780.0956348209195
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"
	561.1729069295371
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	539.5577985884158
But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.	442.14405191044847
How is
such a man to be worked on?	391.2407950298522
How are they even to be discovered?	713.0003958024562
I have
not the smallest hope.	422.3633122198962
It is every way horrible!"
	758.9829202502245
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much.	593.560825105574
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"
	679.8195901065612
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	666.7856426608057
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	795.664749635726
Her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	723.5642558222933
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	793.4024989440803
It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	553.1270922687838
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	824.9540826938804
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	661.6481121583444
Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	764.6394826196698
"Oh, yes.	592.3640888758189
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	580.8444336629644
Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	807.5136396328123
Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."
	550.4801424587292
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	784.7003771120997
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	659.3666427223121
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	777.067911295995
But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	762.4212232918849
Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	726.2686564095056
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	656.4318264205175
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	678.7930102662777
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	518.9651564111366
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	674.9009904701161
But now it was all too natural.	606.6212929282428
For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	643.1560195150458
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	590.5372695471237
Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	761.082002816151
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	774.4489867245638
The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now
feel it.	755.2279285169377
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	741.4446966345347
Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	498.89390679897144
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.	633.9146072325636
Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	774.3932751691543
They were to be off as soon as possible.	281.0599251959663
"But what is to be
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.	382.9819998858392
"John told us Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"
	774.5926785573696
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	446.2002068162152
_That_ is all settled."
	601.2797226866527
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	726.9682749095053
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"
	574.5756597616593
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	754.1656139263819
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	562.7829978254434
CHAPTER V.	592.3640888758189
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	657.395919516438
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	672.9923599205534
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	824.2240247573483
Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	724.2562289079904
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk."
	806.8502690706916
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	541.6430062907449
"Upon my word," said Mrs.	551.9685007165177
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	519.2967160764554
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	525.8439716484731
I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham.	546.3629157738064
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"
	445.2666785748517
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable.	648.2629321544982
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
hope it.	514.6084037748134
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?"
	482.6382876643423
"In the first place," replied Mr.	518.5856453871537
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."
	618.6229293501428
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London.	432.215605486596
They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	804.9447465813827
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."
	632.840684146892
"But why all this secrecy?	601.3418689215518
Why any fear of detection?	651.1302820902868
Oh! no, no, this is not likely.	468.4847367675432
His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	646.3056793091305
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	816.7550186935927
He
cannot afford it.	728.2762576714733
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	758.7137425133676
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	731.5177199228959
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."
	749.5448703899065
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"
	628.024976238862
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	617.1778799330217
But, really, I know not what to say.	359.0017602323417
But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	714.1353530215207
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	633.2420146751939
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	619.3573953362652
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	786.7324498694826
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."
	673.2874966302356
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."
	538.7629763672454
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	666.5984689134918
And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	732.5478038306992
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is.	481.45285062876013
We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	577.5770506114598
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	795.5577707431928
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	607.5500284219079
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.	634.5801792141446
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr.	610.3985844887727
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	549.0097887388324
And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	690.9566413103464
From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	629.1789819952148
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	794.9213100742808
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."
	548.2111640298548
"But does Lydia know nothing of this?	488.2831244453585
"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	587.9354809057907
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr.	679.7584985182357
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself.	571.0248546268183
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	671.0208353042257
As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	677.6727481453827
And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	491.1391532907049
Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	431.0529994196924
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	843.6074537677171
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."
	561.5220543772116
"Not the slightest.	679.790187394607
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	569.9575013655214
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	620.9305477240207
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."
	744.2427066783295
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	732.758556561638
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	697.3656190347006
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	823.4768650629468
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	614.1411980282331
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	620.2956025737839
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	803.8600991766941
"Not yet," replied Jane.	592.3640888758189
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well."
	686.0527109314187
"And have you heard from him often?"
	581.5266720858251
"We have heard only once.	758.9555135508267
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do.	519.5813621006716
He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."
	491.3348195678683
"And my mother--How is she?	558.5275451709211
How are you all?"
	509.5201716008561
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	763.7921137518866
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	669.0765974512954
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.	634.2370530901999
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven! are quite well."
	567.8686579637979
"But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.	628.288030167991
"You look pale.	679.8195901065612
How much you
must have gone through!"
	553.3005418095498
Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr.	582.9079535004721
Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	448.3836440917703
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	553.6996351794955
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	539.7194695438459
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	707.7321926957547
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	555.6169144989157
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	641.7016632887885
I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.	669.2491935322963
Poor dear
child! And now here's Mr.	623.7572114139532
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	530.3331976850567
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.	745.1734668746203
Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr.	419.53712446777325
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	663.314827226342
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	675.5061734603188
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	634.3764183188691
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."
	522.1097861361334
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs.	598.7802972025194
Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for.	500.2709369289187
And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	641.7771010584765
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	739.5813771992447
And, above all things, keep Mr.	679.7828358832079
Bennet from
fighting.	679.8195901065612
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	784.4657944968229
And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	662.20165809915
Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."
	645.3219339146989
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	708.2721956356618
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	600.6959347522632
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	603.6456692068303
One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	706.0241753065037
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	645.6050385877533
As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,
	777.7309690598316
"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	620.2356568274262
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."
	763.815756631799
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	711.9322084383057
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	648.7062230140908
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard.	759.5168887459644
Give me farther particulars.	728.2526347746856
What did Colonel
Forster say?	592.3640888758189
They must have seen them together for ever."
	487.5125406721693
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	635.2840404738957
I am so
grieved for him.	499.9553211257012
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	749.6087874676899
He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."
	662.197021587373
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	596.3398528319599
Did he know of
their intending to go off?	749.8619876487967
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"
	592.3640888758189
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	620.8817896414738
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	623.0063813172701
Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	578.4252660351773
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."
	548.721515491602
"But not before they went to Brighton?"
	633.7393047242122
"No, I believe not."
	656.8140542234568
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	502.5073416916544
Does he
know his real character?"
	565.5709025784231
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did.	564.001967912011
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	487.6538064059307
And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false."
	704.5236141966166
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"
	629.4698472657818
"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	366.9511917231387
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	801.6001174192603
We acted with the best intentions."
	779.5856011470395
"He brought it with him for us to see."
	579.3567145213558
These
were the contents:
	728.1810873844889
"MY DEAR HARRIET,
	592.3640888758189
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
	707.0197919060647
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
	624.5521172774203
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
	535.5427926545308
who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
	545.1032809604416
world I love, and he is an angel.	633.0718915147856
I should never be happy without
	686.484554689568
him, so think it no harm to be off.	693.37408080362
You need not send them word at
	795.6207018344821
Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
	500.43864112417606
surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
	698.2774599671695
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
	565.7526543644829
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
	674.5499316676636
engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	730.1907452454495
Tell him I hope he will
	598.2810632177574
excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
	590.8210554968321
the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	591.6109227281971
I shall send for my
	758.8471413230997
clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
	651.6457936934462
to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
	795.8090695669955
packed up.	895.3721494065021
Good bye.	592.3640888758189
will drink to our good journey.	895.3454592379112
"Your affectionate friend,
	679.8195901065612
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it.	485.96651062260105
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	435.2068916147359
But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	557.4727905155916
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	622.1451373295463
My poor father! how he must have felt it!"
	696.950669329249
"I never saw any one so shocked.	573.0185839043547
He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	629.7494448390313
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"
	703.8447597726076
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"
	479.62356855469415
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."
	573.3154117962542
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	586.5976708972988
You do not look
well.	759.2289821034323
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	510.49873936381334
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	714.4423903639382
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me.	608.7280680182157
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."
	627.8865983847177
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	769.341294567409
Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	758.9866446696941
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
	774.6236785095622
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	601.8252755491386
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	681.6830273049684
It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	641.751473791845
If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	724.184960341918
I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."
	532.8449631001821
CHAPTER VI.	592.3640888758189
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.	543.521938278021
Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	658.7797291692333
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	665.3887403664244
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	680.2631175653916
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr.	724.8273772314378
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	527.3881955087103
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	667.8902246002193
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	706.9700303824313
Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	643.511748687819
Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	807.5143164638424
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	769.872042119914
He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	735.9656416938454
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	390.87381471088304
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	571.8734600628741
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	622.4585696188318
That Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.	589.0301936018234
Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	592.7445578346275
Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	713.9228319070347
He added, that Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon.	633.7373200333012
There was also a postscript to this
effect.	548.4706204946103
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	591.0893338418202
If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	730.0906364111208
At present we
have nothing to guide us.	675.4786774709908
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	589.4234443808483
But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."
	642.0630115020936
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	558.0028579373864
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	727.7636821961386
The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	798.933213452415
Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	620.91077576564
But before they heard again from Mr.	707.0459132414895
Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.	743.2356190223306
Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	747.7359149042805
It was as
follows:
	400.8127694352505
"MY DEAR SIR,
	592.3640888758189
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
	844.2096523899605
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
	675.6505371585669
from Hertfordshire.	592.3640888758189
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	628.375749755057
Collins and
	592.3640888758189
myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
	822.1695343378718
family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
	726.658041697876
arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
	787.9088219314477
a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
	895.2366722685337
must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	670.870248724794
The death
	592.3640888758189
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	394.26772662079856
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
	508.4925548096734
suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
	790.9214445206288
of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
	895.0978709244811
of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
	527.4142034031202
yourself and Mrs.	679.8195901065612
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
	417.12252615259547
disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
	462.194903849955
such an enormity, at so early an age.	895.1063510841002
Howsoever that may be, you
	758.6410133071062
are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
	813.8951678464335
by Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
	480.9363214991077
to whom I have related the affair.	635.043740164997
They agree with me in
	651.1342168689204
apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
	829.1455697357324
injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
	650.8143394001402
Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
	795.6868727855422
with such a family.	388.8819039314675
And this consideration leads me moreover to
	795.6721244108118
reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
	829.2327321427164
November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
	573.7899748787183
all your sorrow and disgrace.	895.1877858500161
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
	601.334812333432
to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
	562.0269792759673
child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
	787.9624605583924
fruits of her own heinous offence.	607.0371349074137
"I am, dear Sir, &c.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	653.452966218384
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	535.047404944436
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	450.25136292964174
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	613.9303996530475
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	658.460899735002
He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	729.0491097315941
"A gamester!" she cried.	509.7072379493457
"This is
wholly unexpected.	601.3485212415869
I had not an idea of it."
	460.75612139034416
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.	642.361269483799
Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	652.7143313414488
When Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	723.2276115155148
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.	651.7057519607234
"Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them.	560.0606423923831
Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
	710.8359649817965
As Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.	396.7778671811407
Bennet
came from it.	544.3596737304917
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	717.5462310310377
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	506.97068219382083
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.	592.055964521736
Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	576.128039813634
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.	731.8650773965273
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	686.6419439167588
It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	746.8741407315804
When Mr.	592.3640888758189
Who should suffer but myself?	601.3628291086941
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."
	582.3616846662459
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.	609.3194801802159
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	688.8007553094575
Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame.	690.3197057310194
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	595.5319769208401
It will pass away soon enough."
	780.144672160903
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"
	432.21210020119184
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"
	816.5736946722642
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	593.9098676101597
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."
	748.8429884537628
Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."
	677.8553103490339
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	530.5093243813432
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."
	744.4877510051386
"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
	640.545966495847
"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	637.7334459951562
No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	753.6327365387958
Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	549.4188326196534
And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."
	730.683545996756
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	840.089785335359
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	589.2200213704818
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."
	534.7422039942533
CHAPTER VII.	592.3640888758189
Two days after Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."
	642.78337960651
We have heard nothing from town."
	686.6481612836358
"Dear madam," cried Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr.	776.6712145767565
He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."
	611.7216684406795
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	843.9448877198257
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,
	609.2999772919653
"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."
	810.3901829130774
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	697.5493004724013
"Oh, Papa, what news?	542.341119582389
what news?	610.7460479709544
have you heard from my uncle?"
	444.14091498276247
"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."
	467.2892708733285
"Well, and what news does it bring?	795.6115287050412
good or bad?"
	693.6213560756419
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."
	714.169664940521
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	673.6515158303511
Jane now came up.	728.2526336691179
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."
	651.9182044871558
"Gracechurch-street, Monday,
	592.3640888758189
"MY DEAR BROTHER,
	592.3640888758189
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
	761.7566316880832
Soon after
	592.3640888758189
you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
	657.8897653490254
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	633.7866257662283
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
	602.0572569133932
"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"
	543.1297155114826
Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.	516.9575684595703
nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
	549.6340074437486
willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
	807.5574694114925
All that is
	679.8888143705672
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
	787.9050645046461
equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
	684.0987425409526
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
	805.4171350919414
These are conditions, which,
	728.2762576714733
considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
	746.0790789255442
far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	558.0544799148104
I shall send this by
	758.9730716644875
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	787.8634367926734
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.	807.5008999689471
Wickham's
	592.3640888758189
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
	658.2894430545269
say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
	616.7996795499088
discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	651.4126458191597
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
	658.2166362130524
in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
	594.4512924429309
immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
	780.1418504100799
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
	542.9923511580654
to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
	695.8360670063157
my diligence and care.	896.0948350504807
Send back your answer as soon as you can,
	367.15474463280253
and be careful to write explicitly.	895.8395640661598
We have judged it best, that my
	795.6173000564688
niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
	619.6599993965102
She comes to us to-day.	595.261991859761
I shall write again as soon as any
	477.29252600951963
thing more is determined on.	895.3256800668523
Your's, &c.	422.4571906875115
"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	506.36129848921706
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"
	562.9465180274639
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	579.643259347481
"My dear father, I congratulate you."
	558.5215062776822
"And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.	661.6983928101334
"No; but it must be done soon."
	390.540672595953
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	744.9252740074656
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	680.650720072014
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."
	574.2094636204255
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."
	720.1691734952382
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."
	481.9986942478707
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	437.7490032187264
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."
	613.6852788589375
"Yes, yes, they must marry.	651.1049329333875
There is nothing else to be done.	368.78229428483263
But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him."
	721.2098902142848
"Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"
	406.7123213704338
"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."
	761.9582016066499
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself.	594.6199258125865
A small sum could not do all this."
	544.5491631703601
I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."
	367.05020565049904
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"
	728.0276823736135
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	352.99993764700895
Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	467.88899705265413
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	387.71714411972357
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	534.4929773297843
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"
	722.0627234776406
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	495.2874980295093
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	676.1524639267438
He has
children of his own, and may have more.	509.47935886885426
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"
	509.7058677105195
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr.	706.6466460926199
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	586.5646837471533
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	449.3076920578034
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	759.8883901934637
By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"
	728.2006404643191
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	652.3600295164148
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	498.2266191175063
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."
	780.3884032836651
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	467.415365058322
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,
	763.5131942943
"Just as you please."
	496.47798929345396
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"
	547.4372557318954
"Take whatever you like, and get away."
	713.1899566873647
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	646.7609407844213
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	628.3582774065001
Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	807.4362848731313
After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	758.4486152688667
Bennet could hardly
contain herself.	758.9626944141328
As soon as Jane had read Mr.	592.3640888758189
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	631.8843055199417
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	654.8326270895025
She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	815.3613846451597
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing.	545.1450987575713
How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly.	595.1808902514618
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	779.4200659282637
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	679.7828317541081
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill.	592.3640888758189
I will put on my things in a moment.	536.0300001558695
My dear, dear
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"
	593.175364004433
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.	740.6943046957433
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	795.6472163682914
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	626.3499026776875
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr.	611.7924820698984
Wickham with money."
	679.8195901065612
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	636.3214087093197
Well! I am so happy.	514.3530805535715
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	534.3956677953149
Wickham! How well
it sounds.	698.793780593341
My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me.	623.728360523142
We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."
	852.6040433508336
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	659.9635407083737
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	666.0376629569502
Other schemes too came into her head.	631.0089558018035
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips.	566.3421441857796
And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs.	611.4907125418116
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	713.1513788354983
An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	416.119529650433
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton?	622.0583068564803
My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news?	583.9185262428437
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."
	687.6750761201707
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	565.5986222459798
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	659.1314122347374
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	654.6998560142563
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	658.1109301628383
He now wished it more than ever.	639.2558033869998
The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	605.6321119477847
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	560.069105769556
When first Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	637.4315011300487
This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	595.3553428635269
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	636.7410048309007
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	596.625001269937
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	706.1549448080386
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.	703.0270626684937
Bennet and
the children.	600.4102449153993
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	696.1969382224718
This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.	603.5732842219052
Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	652.7249686091144
In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	669.5901096410308
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	733.6563876176216
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	798.1295604942894
His letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	852.6317730921949
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.	585.5899423158326
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	557.069772676334
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	735.3111931045626
It was a fortnight since Mrs.	679.560871481955
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	793.8737540414892
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	763.6195997960564
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	809.6379296922585
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	752.712895163787
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.	542.4402085166871
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	789.7572347642993
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	774.6102262006473
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
	743.3626208157166
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.	728.2703518754396
Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs.	702.97761945122
Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	779.9701333797054
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	572.9811148077438
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	758.9725419434492
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	659.5115430001321
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	711.0894225212801
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr.	635.6885542244364
Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	787.1479659519164
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	774.5508970945272
There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	564.9700109063721
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	759.4198424522837
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr.	418.30039630516876
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	757.5363249637568
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	507.9191611716227
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	665.7130203125291
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	799.1463989142228
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	552.9192251290057
She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	744.9341568244091
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	438.3636802835589
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	699.381461967099
But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	561.5316742434702
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	650.9151165093505
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	696.0459280563233
It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	661.7418703727752
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	810.5311883646198
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	682.0875167989844
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	525.3810686917982
But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	845.9008010279265
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	441.3812334684691
Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	691.4187293463348
The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.	535.0965480952785
Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.	633.7572469733534
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
	629.129625372701
as his marriage was fixed on.	610.5206603959884
in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
	895.3988096780733
on his account and my niece's.	679.4771631439837
It is Mr.	592.3640888758189
Wickham's intention to go
	570.4641469371547
into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
	835.0642905681002
some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	656.9196336146586
promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
	799.8701468025093
the North.	592.3640888758189
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
	614.0756794580882
the kingdom.	892.3608790664756
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
	711.7519402103383
where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
	895.2744923206305
more prudent.	895.290507924143
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
	599.5109408583014
our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
	786.7778987100537
various creditors of Mr.	728.2762576714733
assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.	790.995515633457
will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
	562.4230541607415
to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
	660.8324959165121
He has given in all his debts; I hope
	600.2397901219496
at least he has not deceived us.	641.951609866135
Haggerston has our directions, and
	758.9927680419709
all will be completed in a week.	802.1210181382218
They will then join his regiment,
	686.6656158894277
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
	742.0366816855051
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
	557.2933116722149
before she leaves the South.	758.9262336617161
She is well, and begs to be dutifully
	807.3123795730962
remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.	546.3508263844498
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.	666.8635264822324
But Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	493.1980447044506
Lydia's being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	679.5255087657362
"She is so fond of Mrs.	679.7239867183412
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	515.4428195191242
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative.	729.4879988093213
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	554.2364628472433
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North.	547.3397743490208
When Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	498.1651180619752
Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	612.2150942798459
CHAPTER IX.	592.3640888758189
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	630.3656241367871
The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	586.369920819315
Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	684.753739849434
They came.	592.3640888758189
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	613.839216617169
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.	559.9477334408879
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	472.3344072282555
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	783.0628550159585
Their reception from Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	634.6135584806543
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	542.2785648925659
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked.	679.8146897955959
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	758.9927680419709
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	569.0188318044069
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	713.1014178116773
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	758.2663908463429
There was no want of discourse.	604.223157158444
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	381.6755885366044
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	672.0077064808248
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	698.2536406840252
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."
	547.225119807052
Her father lifted up his eyes.	780.1293943693006
Jane was distressed.	526.6351722320229
Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day?	643.2524281778526
I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing."
	741.8025176199756
Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	614.8988204461696
She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	508.5609638109884
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	395.7751322271349
Her ease and good
spirits increased.	686.6048061100759
She longed to see Mrs.	643.345963073944
Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.	709.9558863183042
Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.	573.1943635591526
Hill and the two housemaids.	531.3067900389617
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	388.2809237817789
Is not he a charming man?	604.3343032648675
I
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	750.2811008848962
I only hope they may have half my
good luck.	763.5443300374611
They must all go to Brighton.	679.8048892796321
That is the place to get
husbands.	712.93239738029
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."
	830.6612643700482
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	728.2440779877296
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off.	692.7458486339382
Must it be so?"
	601.0081940467685
"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that.	542.9948290312171
I shall like it of all
things.	713.2935352995138
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	783.9901062319957
We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."
	584.2160785000863
"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.	540.9940467813071
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."
	760.105388887009
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."
	694.6736676015399
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	628.3743314202515
Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	409.4222785820363
No one but Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	716.5515388519929
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	734.4379211320202
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	496.1767403957231
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	653.8671909062928
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	575.0334371078374
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.	432.7904570204143
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,
	510.2706588455368
"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	606.486961765274
Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"
	734.0988320802246
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."
	465.4451339994863
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	568.6992837324709
We were
married, you know, at St.	707.0078433853588
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	728.1955378843816
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	602.8080297620962
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	532.5360699721771
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	614.2174436056065
And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	713.460223399975
However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	711.0137045892479
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	594.5034244993749
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	531.7029454646542
If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight.	615.0091309007481
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	542.901278022591
To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	707.0526533172941
Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr.	666.2816902628592
And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	530.0471580571473
Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	586.3911408966499
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	723.0362480173198
Darcy might have done as well."
	686.7906712482383
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	679.8122396533593
But gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	429.2436469782862
I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	649.3011426417361
It was to be such a secret!"
	414.3874635566418
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	419.56480189870575
You may depend upon my seeking no further."
	584.1861790062684
"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."
	772.5303162107066
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."
	623.3053130950173
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	510.8695455281117
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	543.495322015416
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	372.2429371547472
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	747.7062679884518
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	533.6661722953805
Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	790.9171767681084
"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."
	570.4483545901204
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	696.3464438683591
CHAPTER X.	592.3640888758189
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	454.74711809273236
She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	570.7989076870418
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.	592.3640888758189
"MY DEAR NIECE,
	592.3640888758189
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
	774.6367676554995
not comprise what I have to tell you.	516.9639440354395
I must confess myself
	728.2711548853448
surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	643.6697463401958
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
	674.2237333067224
that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
	807.4177020982905
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
	584.3346015848277
but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
	579.7351293162839
him to act as he has done.	525.7483312852219
But if you are really innocent and
	516.1019346770397
ignorant, I must be more explicit.	728.1139581048213
On the very day of my coming
	461.11311211999504
home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	678.3880224068357
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	763.4036518811665
It was all
	679.6458924397214
over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
	682.773270322854
as _your's_ seems to have been.	525.5296393523033
He came to tell Mr.	551.9185395374051
Gardiner that
	592.3640888758189
he had found out where your sister and Mr.	489.885342400618
Wickham were, and that
	601.3960096524311
he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
	604.340216763096
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
	834.7006542559865
for them.	610.2080410951197
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
	593.5568194512779
owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
	482.78262912224693
known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
	542.8266762660528
to love or confide in him.	705.6736457490284
He generously imputed the whole to his
	604.0071218679055
mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
	629.1433494688196
him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	608.1252409290172
His character
	592.3640888758189
was to speak for itself.	895.2542901526397
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
	807.4743484656037
forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
	600.8809572165949
by himself.	895.2297382469701
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
	567.2922877372596
disgrace him.	895.3431064662041
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
	602.3935427671506
discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
	715.1427338584034
more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
	834.5637692834276
reason for his resolving to follow us.	802.2864295850242
There is a lady, it seems, a
	795.5395861936659
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
	895.1589405792428
he did not say what.	308.7726073138309
She then took a large house in Edward-street,
	711.749525215663
and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	813.9502557170422
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
	674.5302654634045
went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	511.30044431118347
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
	728.2859134018355
and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
	583.2775445699558
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
	650.0533525748771
would have taken up their abode with her.	680.9684696139157
At length, however, our
	728.2548674098374
They were in ----
	679.7429135732702
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	679.8146897955967
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
	722.2996543602882
her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
	720.1398953497193
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
	306.30768861824
offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	675.2465297484092
But he found Lydia
	592.3640888758189
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	484.9153495595081
of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
	557.7676562815875
leaving Wickham.	592.3640888758189
She was sure they should be married some time or
	604.8019243350914
other, and it did not much signify when.	641.2634598495641
Since such were her
	728.2548669917301
feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
	835.065315421356
marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
	790.7772861099091
easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	671.694383848258
He confessed himself
	679.8048892796321
which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
	726.2810750155799
ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	799.747903442839
meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
	666.6349352732667
situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	618.7788308444473
He must go
	526.5782289965277
somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
	560.6298719389217
nothing to live on.	739.1422558582212
Darcy asked him why he had not married your
	630.5191443617679
sister at once.	474.6498299419237
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
	659.0589586089775
he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
	371.6478857193782
must have been benefited by marriage.	629.9019557743752
But he found, in reply to
	565.5644567921684
this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
	635.4730584852878
effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	895.2628639809482
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
	447.2689760991989
against the temptation of immediate relief.	895.2577745308456
They met several times,
	601.3485223269048
for there was much to be discussed.	554.1613321272646
Wickham of course wanted more
	758.8224722382802
than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	693.4773621425829
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.	707.0737334030911
Darcy's next step was
	758.9730716644875
to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
	745.6710705854166
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
	780.1784186270178
your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
	745.6843265922313
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
	533.0573461912189
so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
	829.3355283687812
seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	543.784517576021
gentleman had called on business.	895.2675850931511
On Saturday he came again.	698.7445169956237
father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
	744.0931537436073
had a great deal of talk together.	441.0652920421963
They met again on Sunday, and
	634.5870405968009
then _I_ saw him too.	698.6503719705436
as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	389.05040165309236
But our visitor
	679.8195901065612
was very obstinate.	894.8402653560843
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
	728.1045280893889
defect of his character after all.	693.2382643760313
He has been accused of many
	779.9497771267077
faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	796.8451553684232
Nothing was
	592.3640888758189
to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
	405.2809235450263
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	813.7846640287325
together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
	715.1558191970586
or lady concerned in it deserved.	788.0647837604207
to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
	466.4742781711778
was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
	538.7349582498225
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
	799.8880085622944
letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
	835.1123943457055
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
	805.2192806006626
the praise where it was due.	895.2610103646275
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
	635.1497222735826
You know pretty well, I suppose,
	634.5870405968009
what has been done for the young people.	430.8135155041751
His debts are to be paid,
	541.1274319479957
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
	651.3563689129634
commission purchased.	895.3721494065021
The reason why all this was to be done by him
	350.6091438795105
alone, was such as I have given above.	663.0206352835526
It was owing to him, to his
	492.44572662797543
reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
	604.0131021941081
had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
	350.4958383586929
received and noticed as he was.	518.8931446778984
Perhaps there was some truth in
	686.8977926414215
_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
	791.0048087821621
reserve, can be answerable for the event.	894.949466510734
But in spite of all this
	216.79464530766836
fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
	799.9007027374583
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
	756.1726475774485
for _another interest_ in the affair.	581.8710395481029
When all this was resolved
	570.3525091171738
on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
	762.1923970111236
when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
	645.6130533018433
receive the last finish.	895.1852532072722
I believe I have now told you every thing.	524.7725780160532
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	641.6877297165917
Lydia came to
	679.663796654471
_He_ was
	592.3640888758189
exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
	439.6456153590047
would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
	610.3788674754622
while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
	653.4274990149806
fresh pain.	895.3721494065021
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
	649.5473322297814
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
	441.48711508488395
If she heard me,
	728.1817474598114
it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	435.1068684557231
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
	728.2620825146696
and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	635.4169388326806
punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
	799.7761294724394
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
	602.46541005562
on Wednesday or Thursday.	592.3640888758189
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
	552.2047660001851
Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
	582.4704929330563
enough to say before) how much I like him.	685.5292084377295
His behaviour to us has,
	651.0919201222563
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	627.6179895642082
a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
	786.1491816625933
wife may teach him.	895.3576278185939
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
	807.4481541904095
mentioned your name.	895.3334238831661
But slyness seems the fashion.	758.9927680419709
Pray forgive
	592.3640888758189
me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
	663.8688326812972
far, as to exclude me from P.	565.7328398270354
I shall never be quite happy till I
	661.6847310658515
have been all round the park.	610.1897026141472
A low phaeton, with a nice little
	795.4715819625302
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	730.575183647219
But I must write no more.	555.6839344954433
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	688.7474381583808
Your's, very
	679.8195901065612
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr.	780.1699826633773
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	717.532910730886
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	611.6637330205965
But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	702.6476378730752
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	672.0340544005438
He had to be sure done much.	549.0156090008226
She was ashamed to think how
much.	604.0296119846604
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	736.5149338151493
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	664.605235184271
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	560.9744953288368
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	695.7435988837461
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	443.40551513167077
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	444.4817504074065
She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	634.3041168336058
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	807.7267765940851
She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr.	762.6504844061849
Darcy and herself.	395.8253471003167
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.	734.1816471842759
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her.	640.9622558654762
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."
	627.1624068298111
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	501.0464836878981
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."
	763.4050008145316
"I do not know.	299.78424956700906
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton.	599.9003834492862
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."
	532.2058931624648
She replied in the affirmative.	652.0085138280531
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	596.3553974451332
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose?	691.5554775948375
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	525.6666934282309
But of course she did not mention my name to you."
	471.64005425045957
"Yes, she did."
	680.0898531714624
"And what did she say?"
	758.8388480298015
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	572.0759118084535
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."
	835.4974973947088
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	642.5213581370796
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,
	545.5225049983634
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	674.5453226983863
We passed each other
several times.	686.7023492348218
I wonder what he can be doing there."
	733.7630400541075
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth.	662.9133876661967
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."
	663.9571558587053
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	745.0203946999401
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."
	621.1771194221416
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."
	454.6401890037663
"And do you like her?"
	651.1757824050413
"Very much."
	592.3640888758189
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	674.048779724148
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	458.12689451504326
I am very glad
you liked her.	581.6359598918638
I hope she will turn out well."
	713.2073060079914
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."
	724.1117021789097
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"
	661.4354668699224
"I do not recollect that we did."
	713.3745901195732
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	509.6492210286331
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect."
	585.4008850579688
"How should you have liked making sermons?"
	713.0544969867545
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	719.6451138680661
One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be.	389.96961088459307
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"
	716.6827622624742
"You have.	592.3640888758189
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."
	617.7477522157027
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	367.05869010274876
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."
	549.2017732878761
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	550.1544242274601
Do not let us
quarrel about the past.	733.6545398642387
In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."
	593.2838174255385
CHAPTER XI.	592.3640888758189
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	517.7620927668739
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	638.4562288623189
Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	610.2925347950074
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"
	692.1578401379727
"Oh, lord! I don't know.	679.7828317541081
Not these two or three years perhaps."
	565.3650267336135
"Write to me very often, my dear."
	606.49242679913
"As often as I can.	592.3640888758189
But you know married women have never much time for
writing.	830.4547014057243
They will have nothing else to
do."
	391.08530808741244
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	696.797108668209
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.	728.2253297431039
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	679.6372008530851
I am prodigiously proud of him.	452.6638040266545
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."
	637.8473426856523
The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	516.9112485244285
Bennet very dull for several days.	780.169982268582
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	582.5159302136561
One seems so forlorn without them."
	780.1868542870743
"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth.	716.6989572203614
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."
	835.6862957321703
"It is no such thing.	451.91297577223355
Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	712.2006173562954
If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
	448.2062434971452
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	761.1231716321754
The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	595.3641077463249
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	780.9047482672901
She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	589.0333648567108
"Well, well, and so Mr.	509.70619047398657
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.	707.0737334030911
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.	463.46100457550045
Not that
I care about it, though.	633.8010772461732
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again.	482.7578983778187
But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	572.0152028282359
And who knows what _may_ happen?	780.1784186270178
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	611.2581900979529
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
	816.713803025925
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.	702.9726396240566
Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	494.2944634656419
He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	703.6149643837991
She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."
	680.3516103775937
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	483.89185632745927
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,
	475.2420262065183
"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed.	660.9717359331845
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	763.9817404878472
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at.	728.1611250305419
I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	641.840083549712
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."
	652.7426860686429
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	259.201849569492
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	666.8334954821555
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."
	761.9673407829897
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	522.0574663881608
They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	575.8686517441098
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	692.8196781960849
"As soon as ever Mr.	552.2607268131516
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.	505.9353349031201
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."
	599.0769862914813
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	674.3556412033129
But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."
	648.9279883599264
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.	728.1299330250156
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.	543.5981040320371
"If he wants our society, let
him seek it.	816.8100828734565
He knows where we live.	758.9885112670889
I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."
	750.7374252327525
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	450.60863624790085
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined.	704.3996358815263
We must have Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Long and the Gouldings soon.	592.3640888758189
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."
	643.8811399839307
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr.	614.6643078250052
As the day of his arrival drew near,
	530.6086686716822
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.	483.2470741471877
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	563.9521276031362
My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says.	526.7829601128602
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
	619.2678152478494
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	589.7099826862568
You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."
	729.914595560998
Bingley arrived.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	610.6087484995758
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	725.4421176031755
But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	547.4264807251985
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	707.3045707093296
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.	667.4143380813405
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"
	625.7474317439531
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know."
	536.509098238508
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	715.6654484074718
what's his name.	739.4537076905648
"Good gracious! Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.	666.378423271371
Well, any friend of
Mr.	643.3861298029659
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."
	590.6606343638974
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	691.5947428630169
She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	663.8060408835396
Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	651.1302820902868
Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr.	584.5564500224144
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	494.22198673333116
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	709.6219699666459
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley.	666.2966733842546
Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.	626.8601204869323
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	713.6735137651956
But she would not be secure.	367.63220746937884
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."
	597.4241341510237
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	665.5634965357642
Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	660.4067026977536
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	753.0211516953707
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	655.0720985303053
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	728.2301146217679
He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley.	418.044178819793
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	369.9703797998539
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	816.5643795573018
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	826.9493241779537
He was received by Mrs.	643.3793605638007
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	705.2697188491568
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	750.3093576972148
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.	707.1518421543861
Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	464.4835454592756
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	562.8131139953123
There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	554.0331717716311
But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	700.1712362304866
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	847.3320867926618
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	707.1965492481096
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.	434.62152778467527
"Yet why did he come?"
	558.6440505399323
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	700.8850787266394
"It is a long time, Mr.	559.8513598797997
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.	507.0832616371334
He readily agreed to it.	489.36707539124234
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	565.4037223669812
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true.	614.9439099421919
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	486.1589387704128
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	728.2211277129495
And one of my
own daughters.	469.2885374706499
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	534.576631129097
It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq.	623.686356928079
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	624.1308965537147
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	593.4700371446872
Did you see it?"
	728.1367288217785
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	582.6053394767744
Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	435.7905699274066
How Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	439.6316308853191
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.	420.84321099076783
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long.	651.7116247803758
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	532.2768137673273
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."
	819.3731463031876
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.	654.6874490368396
Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	550.4633960790615
It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	675.1569365796032
A few weeks, he believed.	758.9453889754523
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.	745.0157495394924
Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.	651.359683932223
Bennet's manor.	679.8195901065612
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."
	602.3949736045239
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	753.969780527751
At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	685.3918340736545
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	490.86862399498807
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"
	795.6570215164797
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	702.2193589479095
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	743.0441860333177
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	583.9047527260676
Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	631.8195310425647
But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	516.4687302143142
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	661.6861256105535
Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.	527.6465800835141
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.	684.3466314421236
Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	580.0975939267647
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."
	628.2493029876504
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	647.332194554804
They then went away.	363.6191574835631
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	647.6257755634947
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	795.6292682373322
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"
	608.0106420101364
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	830.5483990595612
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	556.5132446510079
If he fears me, why come hither?	795.6794985640053
If
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	816.7810514107418
Teazing, teazing, man! I will
think no more about him."
	577.020985344345
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	678.4579170901234
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy.	698.4317316894919
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	741.1120725018287
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	661.762214974063
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."
	740.5015099592616
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.	666.5766718397521
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."
	558.6363852681777
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."
	475.0627191620739
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.	666.4896757673938
Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	601.515368798362
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	562.2446397063118
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	589.1843731134555
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	620.9575080892796
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	675.3869212428611
He placed himself by her.	489.39318653000055
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	578.974236921065
He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr.	594.21911982883
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	703.8090358652712
He was on one side of her mother.	363.8219898226768
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	785.2031472132288
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	653.1640974699652
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	573.0687024948357
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	719.78339471829
Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	690.9249481957827
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	712.9676766687636
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."
	519.639686154215
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	621.2836322965509
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,
	548.6999648886698
"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	692.1375335610109
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	387.0720850791915
She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!
	764.4530778355293
"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	638.1999392356316
Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	817.4815605419906
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"
	816.671719543647
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,
	716.978833711615
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
	707.0921727726446
Have all her friends left her?"
	686.4866607212431
Annesley is with her.	421.3220282779238
The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."
	691.9609790502492
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	541.4051900254875
He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	706.4175506420797
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	589.9476649056505
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	713.1184832799379
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	549.7089428098155
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	576.1726800090184
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day?	351.1307588160035
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you.	650.017429862084
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	692.2339484547006
The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	852.7769516814268
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas's last week; and even Mr.	768.888285366345
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least.	614.7849604330578
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty.	683.2267404779377
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	594.1100003326679
And
what do you think she said besides?	421.3946702395976
'Ah! Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.	603.5561080150227
I do think Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
	634.5742438885252
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	655.911454710199
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	638.3109436793405
"The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	729.7630212874502
I hope we
may often meet again."
	713.1449204458323
Elizabeth smiled.	592.3640888758189
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	432.13042300580275
You must not suspect me.	758.8964007450246
I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	763.8777722446383
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	654.2837244346813
It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."
	644.0248512503947
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
	763.5871444735279
"And how impossible in others!"
	758.9927680419709
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	765.0599575220206
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."
	598.9174480276214
CHAPTER XIII.	592.3640888758189
A few days after this visit, Mr.	707.0094241547012
Bingley called again, and alone.	758.9065256089115
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	576.7120343629149
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	687.7589878582748
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."
	612.3312396368522
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	717.5890131720492
"Can you come to-morrow?"
	651.0464800027754
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	708.3654440450339
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	603.4419857405334
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,
	736.2278653145144
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	609.2514577314878
He is come--Mr.	592.3640888758189
Make haste, make haste.	728.264775358192
Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	738.3600236924558
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."
	634.5870405968009
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."
	575.7016619493024
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	625.797893960693
Come be quick, be quick!
where is your sash my dear?"
	651.7807832799047
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	389.6375662194446
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	520.9542171673863
After tea, Mr.	592.3640888758189
Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	627.5693352099661
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs.	684.7502354096393
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	678.1301573481928
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?	629.8953051448615
What do
you keep winking at me for?	807.4768393554646
"Nothing child, nothing.	679.8195901065612
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,
	758.075293761577
"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	368.21145476582984
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	703.916009027514
In a few minutes, Mrs.	390.3431899186382
Bennet half opened the door and called out,
	454.38975869214033
Elizabeth was forced to go.	381.4336231695313
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	389.82380434715697
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."
	686.675540851481
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	807.415396597393
Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	580.3390832469612
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	788.4990619193846
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	656.4565197557105
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	616.671444303019
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.	468.6298806575369
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.	710.540389308614
Darcy
returned within the stated time.	780.1193494450857
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	768.1249900872821
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.	651.0937629877053
Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	763.21570051034
There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	766.4149552587718
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs.	411.8471629107098
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	662.3563903160996
Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	544.4483923692609
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	599.6871187759242
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	719.7417137139188
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	840.1776483977592
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	460.92665856171504
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	490.0623616867416
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.	640.0252378228138
I do not deserve it.	759.2486869665069
Oh!
why is not every body as happy?"
	733.6392685902538
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	855.1031240572936
Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	644.0539240554584
But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	499.2647137523783
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	696.8863768606591
He is gone to my father already.	603.7971197868321
Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"
	690.8049071348153
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	682.7200855869461
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	776.5624176448554
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
	603.7950460196901
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	533.2834229531056
"With my mother up stairs.	548.639975843365
She will be down in a moment I dare say."
	454.6484510735587
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	663.5647118096057
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	620.587488861683
They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	696.8387825000086
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	624.9615477161644
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	774.6641915913725
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr.	606.7270492923261
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	684.7068363526256
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,
	588.772656032703
"Jane, I congratulate you.	542.3323237818173
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	724.1398462563321
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	547.7511274418664
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	560.7353311191255
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	525.2202091056669
You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."
	776.607375446083
"I hope not so.	544.2624900333328
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."
	830.3715792572161
I knew how it
would be.	338.4496849011226
I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	483.41037488104604
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"
	606.1864171010442
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	698.6503284298446
Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	795.6232878015155
At that moment, she cared for no other.	605.791301541439
Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	662.5476428240903
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	589.7188123574532
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	659.0652027583066
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	703.530155332666
In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	576.7096087710158
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
believed it possible."
	645.14047215904
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.	679.8800674222637
"But how did he account for
it?"
	498.67124888561347
They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	716.6592725992962
But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."
	606.4831545461404
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter.	689.3094412491762
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."
	649.8721472957023
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"
	738.0678306435914
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	716.9720031972893
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	462.30723546497774
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane.	780.0396284784016
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"
	699.1573283180398
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you.	591.3583126024497
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr.	709.0445933985507
Collins in time."
	526.5668378898688
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	513.8488372481414
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	728.2644461272977
Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.	742.3054808604489
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	590.7346724695932
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	583.3502974877584
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	639.6461240938996
The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	814.5486171897968
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	699.2368328241179
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	741.4556248671078
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	592.3640888758189
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.	617.1949333068927
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	662.3572377199205
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	547.7859983901958
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	676.9289837997414
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	661.1218981906421
That lady I suppose is your mother."
	598.6755923580149
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	430.89102718171864
"Yes, madam," said Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	583.0520535326502
"She is my youngest girl but one.	795.5688699706714
My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."
	555.5901374711243
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.	536.1616676911078
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
	518.2163527580105
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."
	631.2813557217521
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,
	678.5345532917893
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.	635.581684014212
and
Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Collins well."
	592.3640888758189
"Yes, very well.	375.96892776987994
I saw them the night before last."
	795.6352505281969
But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	593.247525245054
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,
	719.7192829339691
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	606.3176366464403
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."
	621.4748453630375
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	616.5793273322195
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."
	465.2774471646697
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	740.881325627012
As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	627.760154687089
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	483.25606912420204
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	718.7695028924508
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
her face.	686.8171504104625
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--
	414.1628154449325
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	660.3682650200644
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."
	707.1241186407046
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	758.9829202502245
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	450.8887532226515
I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."
	430.9051097089285
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with.	543.3448381776165
My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	657.4931325974588
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	684.6539815353948
I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.	647.905379183199
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."
	593.7584928693369
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	584.2716744293226
What could your ladyship propose by it?"
	631.0487770648031
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
	696.6804163898814
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	733.6255217848656
Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"
	540.814136077892
"I never heard that it was."
	375.97030975902777
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"
	493.1758984331414
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	672.225144721925
_You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."
	645.5665975752204
"This is not to be borne.	374.058237011842
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	707.0606250544387
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
	515.8122476190523
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	412.3517256722774
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	624.6354593336531
You
may have drawn him in."
	780.1684002958048
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
	706.9504326223449
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	567.8566056374194
I have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	579.2580912448161
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
	638.7740825746237
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."
	696.0357578956637
"Let me be rightly understood.	758.9927680419709
This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	646.7549341930851
No, never.	592.3640888758189
Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	686.6567788555632
Now what have you to say?"
	467.79455249172344
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,
	561.7848916838101
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	816.5157962451028
From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other.	573.9995659518418
It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	646.6680091222529
While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	618.9285595960031
To his
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	656.8140542234568
Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	662.0051470732715
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"
	815.0282963061572
"Yes, and I had heard it before.	598.7310911474393
But what is that to me?	483.3278527972965
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh.	621.9431718643599
You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	555.2369584241484
Its completion depended on others.	758.9829202502245
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	699.6331510089307
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
	660.1180560894243
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	733.7843352672143
Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	719.0344339246905
You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	580.6258067764636
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."
	669.0521717051745
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.	679.8122396533593
"But the wife of Mr.	483.6209578891355
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	722.5942563484646
Is nothing due to me on that
score?	807.4470649356954
"Let us sit down.	728.2593435742782
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it.	670.105553031763
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	554.1096037276321
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."
	415.4128533942877
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."
	790.8844347223845
"I will not be interrupted.	447.62150768149303
Hear me in silence.	601.238855759123
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	574.0980342322415
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	802.6435914610039
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	648.9071495636858
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	629.1579689363225
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	513.5869434622807
If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."
	495.73708076386566
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	678.9237717630126
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	565.558838487754
But who was your mother?	601.1408486899486
Who
are your uncles and aunts?	780.1868542870743
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."
	807.1829168816561
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"
	674.0043428395867
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,
	559.9632939834646
"I am not."
	526.5402339294316
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	656.803401688604
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"
	758.3507458075461
"I will make no promise of the kind."
	584.4072775714333
I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	659.1921973154159
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede.	763.8860404148703
I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require."
	672.9201255213499
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	672.317670023839
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	601.2500599876194
Your ladyship wants Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	800.1982648972391
Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	693.5576544707701
You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	715.533533501673
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	723.7534221892248
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."
	544.4708679654641
"Not so hasty, if you please.	565.6110186649349
I have by no means done.	480.54168776561323
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	669.2694092130158
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	742.8566599706634
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	641.4582420539615
And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	722.4506499840905
Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	642.6610556389511
Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	599.091583028901
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"
	711.6477823776265
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	606.358524913237
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	634.3589416287291
I must beg to return to
the house."
	396.27428142908235
And she rose as she spoke.	614.9917516849606
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	766.8154291131129
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	758.9435275955993
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"
	655.7404110359126
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	409.839031276511
You know my sentiments."
	728.2053802228041
"You are then resolved to have him?"
	603.9598330560106
"I have said no such thing.	506.53232730674637
I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
	775.180443328645
"It is well.	679.790187394607
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	780.1547052624404
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	830.5431600022599
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
	432.43990928530656
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	765.2430249374398
No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr.	779.9740220956559
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."
	616.3452177573652
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	654.5711861622437
I
shall now know how to act.	603.8285919209843
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	683.1587310054048
I came to try you.	758.8588590781219
I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."
	599.9279135926419
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,
	535.3065196845632
"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	628.4604686935465
You deserve no such attention.	651.1435365563585
I am most seriously displeased."
	758.9829202502245
She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	716.6905589462333
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	660.4318950613224
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."
	722.6284315804994
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	692.2032455220714
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	705.6877977703882
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	705.1930255357711
CHAPTER XV.	592.3640888758189
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	602.3728597187466
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.	727.0480862927081
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	701.2535003678748
And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	746.390500496663
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	513.1516264871224
From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	661.7057530875696
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	676.3132694007273
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	729.4759513833137
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	689.7909270447092
In that case he would return no more.	569.9582105725748
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it.	620.2634932691153
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	735.4025654678002
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."
	632.0046261140208
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	587.8378761285801
Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	514.336796522436
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	657.6535991235171
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."
	660.4941958281847
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	623.5476833062149
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	630.490416813646
He
then said,
	461.19280737506995
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	626.3521224120236
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	612.2114783434449
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	566.4702873943183
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."
	816.5202538617825
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,
	671.9301285479088
"You look conscious.	679.8195901065612
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	668.924008275167
This letter is from Mr.	643.3694334962107
"From Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"
	500.03662484395153
"Something very much to the purpose of course.	406.50525823904513
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.	684.2906819581787
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	707.9826970923071
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	565.6110807229725
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	745.1466002123504
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	658.4112301102333
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."
	652.0230586598537
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	816.7721858077188
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."
	690.0397043031811
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	711.7160242133868
But now it comes out."
	758.9829202502245
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	599.0360407139179
We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."
	694.395760112402
Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you.	686.4379284461029
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	770.2392935541883
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	661.3833274244427
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	503.4520719972523
"Oh! yes.	592.3640888758189
Pray read on."
	461.2127522486373
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	657.0894981671751
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.	712.3395275292858
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	734.4459874709967
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	584.0759774278096
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it.	723.1898905065809
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	743.9768371915476
But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	512.8561022667592
You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	582.92762595271
For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"
	790.8701618872993
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	666.5704941783911
But it is so
strange!"
	759.2332556160043
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	795.6380379020383
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr.	604.6325620460381
Collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	780.121193740846
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report?	643.3819558810014
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	662.7676774312284
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	489.75198541001987
It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	747.2378237637253
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr.	700.8239087036189
CHAPTER XVI.	592.3640888758189
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr.	747.3119254651542
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit.	591.2869470760098
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	707.0868401541269
Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out.	690.556195148205
It was agreed to.	601.3211057359367
Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	509.25314898677055
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	659.3433787475075
Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,
	728.23274657748
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	619.1344530973872
I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	726.8505188798896
Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
	547.6943948382677
I did not think Mrs.	430.10151584256613
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."
	572.7443081908641
"You must not blame my aunt.	686.572092818643
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars.	556.4234684518639
Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."
	585.9800806926306
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	668.1326545542703
But your
_family_ owe me nothing.	780.1868542870743
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_."
	616.1870044406688
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	506.98466489602214
After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.	570.3707867147448
If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	585.9409640819507
_My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."
	683.8423489815151
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	755.9292585225244
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	660.1456300910768
Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	684.1527020921731
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	807.457813228595
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	585.1762314434118
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	696.7978758526929
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
	703.8418485585188
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	747.8035801914921
After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."
	751.7462936418303
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	692.0468455209765
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	734.5411424712639
It was
unpardonable.	679.8195901065612
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."
	604.0882560747846
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth.	807.3650052705773
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	576.2800194609824
Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.	572.632806278698
You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
	669.7446220846522
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	683.2302197730099
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."
	405.1727299543002
"I can easily believe it.	558.6109319900432
You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did.	644.2920359229074
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."
	636.1891763714605
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	598.0935523929525
These recollections will not do at
all.	430.44608145913315
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
	521.4625713909403
Darcy mentioned his letter.	544.3541879699524
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	585.8838751136026
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"
	747.1293935446427
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	773.964793179112
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	527.7572837865924
I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."
	835.7532358047923
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."
	741.5226263340819
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."
	665.1878698337059
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	713.2552474614374
The
adieu is charity itself.	758.9927680419709
You must learn some
of my philosophy.	795.5215802017443
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	656.5248849570179
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	762.0576654341593
But with _me_, it is not so.	364.5489717419742
Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	560.2745285169548
I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	695.6273047042803
As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.	714.1264389774885
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	843.9456070060481
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	622.3645655791996
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	752.2409065377205
By you, I was properly humbled.	679.819590106562
I came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	556.7793585308318
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"
	691.6115707672358
"Indeed I had.	592.3640888758189
What will you think of my vanity?	541.0800060108958
I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."
	717.5207663562921
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	494.06357394390807
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	844.0364493270592
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"
	615.7793702209567
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."
	692.8829752737462
You blamed me for coming?"
	758.8862714168168
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."
	706.9753413554934
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	628.2898795910036
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."
	649.5972981876868
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	700.3430298209853
How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."
	649.516247083945
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	692.7586512928201
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	666.9444307020551
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	627.8243205902323
"What could become of Mr.	643.3861298029659
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	743.253421971525
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.	745.0851530842292
"Not at all.	278.44717856250907
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
	575.4226315398798
"That is to say, you had given your permission.	816.8271555194691
I guessed as much." And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	583.864578184622
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	575.006743871679
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	687.4601620457277
His surprise was great.	544.3933199182743
He had never had the
slightest suspicion.	795.7104378198507
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	570.0108530273051
"From the former.	422.3801691008958
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."
	597.9957623131768
"It did.	592.3640888758189
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	758.9829202502245
His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	740.5346126184893
I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	749.7568701194723
I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	668.0659748858501
He was
angry.	679.790187394607
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	669.0656667300204
He has heartily forgiven me
now."
	686.6688242241098
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.	598.3087658570915
Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	718.1130278202509
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	552.9965416528609
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	498.67192368277296
In the hall they parted.	758.8271749903956
CHAPTER XVII.	592.3640888758189
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	391.641607061304
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	589.7469018538305
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	616.2088879091611
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	717.7209153364819
The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	763.5717109096793
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	635.5680777196177
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	708.8681549409914
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	728.209849915265
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	668.584805022247
"You are joking, Lizzy.	592.3640888758189
Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me.	641.5186056915013
I know it to be impossible."
	345.08928235718116
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	560.6121873705725
Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest.	679.770911460774
I speak nothing but the truth.	614.7095851012872
He still loves me, and we are
engaged."
	733.6748166654797
Jane looked at her doubtingly.	465.06260056525053
I know how much
you dislike him."
	639.1966959168109
"You know nothing of the matter.	271.3990805526034
_That_ is all to be forgot.	779.9187131265563
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now.	619.9097112658915
But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	696.9426683270807
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."
	691.998186165422
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	728.2605082514226
Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	733.6852552342099
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane.	618.0892268142192
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	669.3929484798467
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"
	569.416615248501
"There can be no doubt of that.	435.6729465262619
It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	436.0147164159311
Shall you like to have such a brother?"
	666.4412425371878
"Very, very much.	422.3944957293602
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight.	711.7314170419128
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	601.3846177553022
And do you
really love him quite well enough?	717.7148084504439
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	580.5345484326356
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."
	577.5855213070205
I am
afraid you will be angry."
	354.6816468166591
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	795.664749635726
I want to talk very seriously.	780.059838831678
Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"
	601.2291618539317
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	772.4174100671485
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."
	747.2680992913217
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	641.1877655926115
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	660.9782260608835
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	523.191208853486
I
always had a value for him.	543.2722938238588
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	680.6233443008551
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	466.9010876622137
How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you."
	637.4153600190721
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	807.4406639331297
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	543.4075238184007
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	704.3826154574459
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.	627.9579723910357
Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	661.0017182811175
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	743.760019402457
What shall we do with him?	549.214714143004
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way."
	550.0807206449335
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	706.6837599616323
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.	556.1735120178855
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"
	720.701337029902
"I advise Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.	592.3640888758189
Darcy has
never seen the view."
	780.1225551652572
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.	651.0197788237206
Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty.	411.7633305438815
Wont it, Kitty?"
	592.3640888758189
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	439.9662620385788
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented.	617.0547238395441
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	536.3207807763921
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	588.9138671543891
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	459.9659400569435
So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."
	795.8503874075944
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.	728.7983722757826
Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	507.5553172622521
She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	761.1348778360334
But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.	607.5622334193465
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	810.4060737994968
In the evening, soon after Mr.	679.7788814938253
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr.	529.535618298863
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	799.299604535392
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.	676.7945802179447
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	673.5659373796278
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	559.3397413148522
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	635.6761238943445
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	630.9766144425012
Have not you always hated him?"
	780.0618539581451
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr.	713.0041202107168
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	519.0338370717321
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	575.4379088055704
But will they make you happy?"
	780.1531074560767
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"
	719.9041288469521
"None at all.	278.44717856250907
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."
	608.9758129281648
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	588.1492597481696
Indeed he has no improper pride.	780.0054190120036
He is perfectly amiable.	601.3308609503973
You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."
	496.3077967501122
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.	551.1420590942976
He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	692.344282167922
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	705.9151262422515
But let me advise you to think better of it.	413.9353678960178
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	757.3593482849874
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	751.9369416188867
You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	795.6721244108118
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	736.0695809666788
You know not what you are
about."
	570.4880240249173
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.	695.1561283339524
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	704.9025759111405
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say.	407.824353037411
If this be the case, he deserves you.	613.7206975800427
I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."
	560.5645391438917
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.	770.3898719128927
Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia.	679.8195901065612
He heard her with astonishment.	558.6467166003337
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better.	672.5868558284247
It will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	824.2814362507191
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	775.2440961510308
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."
	587.0933827669807
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr.	628.2149684026479
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."
	760.3299389066987
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	634.8985936366968
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	640.0868984517151
Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	770.4134708227781
Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	733.7374364173402
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	611.502409924451
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	860.7473846291688
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr.	698.801746393661
Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true?	627.6881961822914
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	561.2253580150574
I am so
pleased--so happy.	686.6493578196809
Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	718.5749346860301
I
hope he will overlook it.	686.6101352245847
Dear, dear Lizzy.	592.3640888758189
A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me.	552.4766691861853
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	658.437951512642
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	536.8745350568511
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence.	500.4471129997946
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	707.0210689262167
Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."
	707.0900965804905
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	684.0925556250057
Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	646.9399495265432
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr.	504.21719957675987
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	538.2911531830476
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	729.4353461918508
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."
	616.4200595824631
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	402.9341133326119
"How could
you begin?" said she.	568.084983983671
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"
	727.2948867703728
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	857.1986713926043
I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."
	603.8623214682455
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	674.3259523070435
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"
	824.2107265130716
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."
	691.385297808598
"You may as well call it impertinence at once.	533.6157936814684
It was very little less.	570.2528496245285
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	742.0141816382427
Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	726.4730245502091
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	652.3724548514728
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?"
	747.2277895470573
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	532.9256635868451
But make a virtue of it
by all means.	588.0257436710244
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	571.6961394968944
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	726.9418166036139
Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"
	546.0829271519348
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."
	830.428334526852
"And so was I."
	592.3640888758189
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."
	696.0544258026938
"A man who had felt less, might."
	648.7931624492269
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	612.4270680190766
I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	694.8664585604288
_Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	654.4081777270679
This will never do."
	728.2306166072362
"You need not distress yourself.	758.9240969554261
The moral will be perfectly fair.	779.9288732710398
Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	735.5703279690782
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	850.1537670643306
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	616.0279929383191
My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."
	655.3015539530071
But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for?	622.5764904373979
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	728.2393510694088
My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."
	608.2158844757317
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."
	451.2306205364
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	713.455728199229
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."
	716.7387546095346
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.	770.4427184760518
Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	619.0877503331668
Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:
	671.9514249151489
to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	732.6187583625989
You supposed more than
	728.3114228166286
really existed.	895.3431064662041
actually married, you cannot greatly err.	895.3213875828815
You must write again very
	651.1403434163518
soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	602.4811234637085
thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	361.3799474998562
How could I
	592.3640888758189
be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	628.1859599936396
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
	763.4498643723173
with such justice.	556.2558827617312
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
	670.5143512866381
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
	608.213109709354
spare from me.	607.4140255704464
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	499.2164908602715
Your's, &c."
	422.4571906875115
Bennet sent to Mr.	592.3640888758189
Collins, in
reply to his last.	565.4633578464567
"DEAR SIR,
	592.3640888758189
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	807.4677979780874
Elizabeth will
	592.3640888758189
soon be the wife of Mr.	614.8735868838468
Console Lady Catherine as well as
	415.02346860243415
you can.	223.08261969738837
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	688.1378833882338
He has
	592.3640888758189
more to give.	607.2967681521592
"Your's sincerely, &c."
	728.2762576714733
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	660.7910340595245
She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	611.332017624827
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	688.3254314869615
Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	608.7918809536898
Before any answer could arrive from Mr.	707.0933939274524
Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	688.302469129617
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	750.0390821443913
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	734.3561498169722
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr.	543.214955251398
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	592.8015976671552
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	713.1490480659685
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St.	711.8690066353196
James's, with very decent composure.	780.1784186270178
If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	470.5876153166916
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs.	733.7144621856232
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	645.9003929287519
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	752.9161642912886
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.	662.1532237591878
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.	780.043812646514
Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	689.0034400144834
With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs.	728.2703518754396
Darcy may be guessed.	727.8779931101853
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	608.0768577075395
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	599.0035905788496
He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	669.0117173700651
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	570.5164466961019
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	678.8940044282415
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	637.5798095881029
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	579.9303304656503
In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	591.415445141721
She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	721.4665329234803
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.	627.3364252322465
Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	713.1388996743267
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.	604.6002495382281
Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	807.3782086939643
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	554.5247969033884
He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	562.7759451428499
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	718.5904624306036
The letter was to this
effect:
	409.940217603198
If you love Mr.	592.3640888758189
Darcy half as well as I do my dear
	380.88570303989417
Wickham, you must be very happy.	393.9732344559583
It is a great comfort to have you
	544.375601887262
so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
	440.30314400045046
think of us.	430.917208880876
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
	742.0381605924439
much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
	611.5687004038874
upon without some help.	895.4443432161835
Any place would do, of about three or four
	682.0480938836008
hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.	763.6494073634393
Darcy about it,
	327.68278065007564
if you had rather not.	432.14802128423185
"Yours, &c."
	592.3640888758189
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	646.6474420534815
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	593.0151324810025
It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	753.920390565682
Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	750.8813990805961
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	704.5873557773853
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	614.1573997752178
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	715.433110906496
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	698.3587602717935
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.	708.8114471289896
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.	663.2982745285478
Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	616.5189064347679
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	780.621845067491
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	645.8313926233536
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	689.3711906321145
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	602.9084599806386
Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	589.6590548331553
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed.	830.3753748949669
