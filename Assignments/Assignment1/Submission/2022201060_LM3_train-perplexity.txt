	592.3640888758189
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	1412.8458615614923
A yellow
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air.	1744.5555814973532
He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
	1616.804125667366
—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.	592.3640888758189
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
	1911.2179040558565
—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
	1003.5207247794181
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	1496.6093851734731
He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains.	1886.831414067932
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head.	1324.022059986542
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.	1787.4481286308924
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.	1512.6682527505625
He added in a preacher’s tone:
	1452.229978061234
—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns.	1189.3166456136653
Slow music, please.	946.4336915828404
Shut your eyes, gents.	1196.291823252409
One
moment.	592.3640888758189
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	1616.8097872075996
Silence, all.	592.3640888758189
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points.	1858.669849678458
Two strong shrill whistles
answered through the calm.	1699.822275724704
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	1512.105814575813
That will do nicely.	1196.289489039867
Switch off
the current, will you?	1031.3961511555733
The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	1851.6810208159347
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	1161.990521257202
—The mockery of it! he said gaily.	883.7111534166298
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
	946.4336915828393
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.	1347.526801463808
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.	1685.184442815486
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.	1188.3858525822793
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	946.4110278693748
But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?	878.8984479064198
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	1616.6600942936332
We
must go to Athens.	784.6569260199074
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?	1386.1487612883661
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
	1823.8402529163222
—Will he come?	737.2943990675084
The jejune jesuit!
	946.4336915828404
Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	1031.5927920865129
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	574.1908487392924
—Yes, my love?	946.4203558902273
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	1109.9243862751387
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	1364.1653987598584
—God, isn’t he dreadful?	1001.3112572484637
he said frankly.	940.1420371481895
A ponderous Saxon.	592.3640888758189
He thinks
you’re not a gentleman.	684.3987241540965
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
and indigestion.	870.8332444381799
Because he comes from Oxford.	675.4859772780535
You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner.	713.2192677332072
He can’t make you out.	1334.5619211752844
O, my name for you
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.	1263.4713168139492
He shaved warily over his chin.	1250.4087551753344
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	1191.2255763775224
Where is
his guncase?	1196.239052431183
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
Were you in a funk?	1184.681402886813
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	1293.4680394945897
Out here in the dark
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther.	1167.8412018102508
You saved men from drowning.	1020.3515098952826
I’m not a hero, however.	1197.3795032264102
If
he stays on here I am off.	1003.524259793509
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	1280.0258055487707
He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	1384.710826163789
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
pocket, said:
	1228.1546403436703
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	1870.9437794580278
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	1196.3022706333559
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
	838.1728466451367
—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	1017.1784933356415
You can almost taste it, can’t you?	1014.8284781995512
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.	1534.297095209483
—God! he said quietly.	666.5079212829693
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother?	1056.3591198605347
The snotgreen sea.	946.4336915828404
The scrotumtightening sea.	946.4336915828404
_Epi oinopa
ponton_.	946.4336915828404
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	841.809959736356
You must read them
in the original.	861.1513267096818
_Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.	801.8117641295776
Come and look.	946.4215135713408
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	681.3583047850323
Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown.	1042.6717078985703
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face.	1088.3791496443412
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	826.218432264878
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	748.7545201171381
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	1147.8427573882848
I’m hyperborean as much as you.	1046.6358262675308
But to
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
pray for her.	1219.3806579502073
And you refused.	946.4336915828404
There is something sinister in you....	1334.6300956903033
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	1823.8381246555239
A tolerant
smile curled his lips.	1031.5077834022027
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	1548.0494186361573
Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!
	920.4044134769237
He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	1626.5761450579416
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.	1900.726142741916
Silently,
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes.	1500.9237451791703
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	1541.6753828730543
The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	1946.088776806097
A bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	2099.4689370536057
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	1055.8742985819104
—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	1049.2909108607564
I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags.	1442.7398889572396
How are the secondhand breeks?	1376.7941955701383
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	748.7545201171381
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	1426.0955467686576
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	983.532214818538
Secondleg they should be.	991.9222667923942
God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	1427.1310276820964
I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey.	1823.1541439556318
You’ll look spiffing in them.	1334.618373883897
I’m not joking, Kinch.	784.6684206127763
You
look damn well when you’re dressed.	1427.1291224760673
—Thanks, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
I can’t wear them if they are grey.	1318.4685612883884
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	688.1353534280103
Etiquette is etiquette.	946.4336915828404
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers.	1439.2732336421768
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.	2003.0338692603148
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.	1376.2998185024971
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g.	972.8854915816032
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	643.0299576241225
General paralysis of the insane!
	1376.0023806314257
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	1511.8189285146627
His curling shaven lips
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	1836.3886623460096
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
	1548.4994334461358
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack.	1753.142168384332
Hair on end.	946.4248011905848
As he and others see me.	1103.6331726567155
Who chose this
face for me?	1011.5635498217432
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	1512.121060961331
It asks me too.	899.573413215382
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.	719.2676176757309
It does her
all right.	812.009771111113
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	1196.3022706333559
Lead him not into temptation.	1376.8378625310465
And her name is Ursula.	675.4846323035769
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	926.3729807170298
If
Wilde were only alive to see you!
	939.6436373869744
Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
	1003.4927242484933
—It is a symbol of Irish art.	885.0560738932307
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	722.3240595168754
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them.	1671.672660909772
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	1040.0367836246485
he said kindly.	570.5482614561977
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	1322.5918800936047
Parried again.	592.3640888758189
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	1149.8938392322493
The
cold steel pen.	1196.2938424605543
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	1128.9086797125278
He’s stinking with money and
thinks you’re not a gentleman.	1087.51712837169
His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	1597.780066571986
God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might do something for the island.	1407.463737949015
Hellenise it.	592.3640888758189
Cranly’s arm.	647.1842956733051
His arm.	592.3640888758189
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	1386.760092230752
I’m the only one
that knows what you are.	1311.8160760702126
Why don’t you trust me more?	922.4352020678831
What have you up
your nose against me?	1548.0749031266464
Is it Haines?	592.3640888758189
If he makes any noise here I’ll
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
Clive Kempthorpe.	1093.8165163448602
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.	1039.4171402024822
Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	1823.8580150361684
O, I shall
expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears.	1320.0943019092415
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.	1700.0551995049875
I don’t
want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!
	895.1672182833101
Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	1400.8357465646
A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	1699.9633348689345
To ourselves...	592.3640888758189
new paganism...	2415.8767426140507
—Let him stay, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night.	1626.5339673478375
—Then what is it?	283.24921913491715
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	841.8114424048898
Cough it up.	383.01190899943276
I’m
quite frank with you.	1087.3388136054566
What have you against me now?	1197.4624057868978
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	1394.64904271567
Stephen freed his arm
quietly.	1376.836898874594
—Do you wish me to tell you?	883.8621397341815
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—Yes, what is it?	283.24921913491715
Buck Mulligan answered.	592.3640888758189
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.	936.6890126602054
A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes.	1721.879924267891
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
	1323.5680461894497
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
death?	1147.2418089735327
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
	894.3262225484062
I can’t remember anything.	1020.3148441526308
I remember only ideas and
sensations.	1512.1352658891194
What happened in the name of God?	621.0530133552722
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
more hot water.	1557.041122909792
Your mother and some visitor came out of the
drawingroom.	1060.8227923081495
She asked you who was in your room.	1474.196304045476
Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
What did I say?	592.3640888758189
I forget.	592.3640888758189
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead._
	788.933278631433
A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
Mulligan’s cheek.	1360.8560623456226
he asked.	168.4727106542555
What harm is that?	624.4505370395897
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	1616.8081299031865
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?	1636.9924558850394
You saw
only your mother die.	1512.1122568908575
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	1314.0376166778906
It’s a beastly
thing and nothing else.	1699.8907947988437
It simply doesn’t matter.	1185.2404452426529
You wouldn’t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	1677.6625070399787
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected
the wrong way.	1887.297596878097
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.	1260.5438761267044
Her cerebral lobes
are not functioning.	1512.0998997841007
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt.	1262.691809681895
Humour her till it’s over.	1250.5749946287558
You crossed her
last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
some hired mute from Lalouette’s.	1540.8266806205816
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	795.303071916556
I
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	1159.926774906597
He had spoken himself into boldness.	1512.1317147529485
Stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
	1856.742377456229
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	1456.2329890376627
—Of what then?	647.1903747676978
Buck Mulligan asked.	592.3640888758189
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	795.3158796518718
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	1322.5699717274192
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	1512.1317148251362
Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	1836.8579051771371
Sea and headland now
grew dim.	1512.138816961438
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks.	1644.3277903367252
A voice within the tower called loudly:
	1452.685209931502
—Are you up there, Mulligan?	784.6701945885609
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	592.3640888758189
He turned towards Stephen and said:
	559.7583937287142
—Look at the sea.	654.4033585490936
What does it care about offences?	1512.1339988826137
Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down.	1082.0041505167685
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	1196.3022706333559
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:
	1136.6088880307973
—Don’t mope over it all day, he said.	1152.6287754507907
I’m inconsequent.	946.4336915828404
Give up the
moody brooding.	1376.7193979119616
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:
	1430.649174868945
And no more turn aside and brood
	716.0717362356347
Upon love’s bitter mystery
	812.2953828504092
For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	1196.297383539534
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed.	1904.9706485477946
Inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	1873.3130349108187
White breast of the
dim sea.	1333.9426384841393
The twining stresses, two by two.	1177.9728072386667
A hand plucking the
harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	1767.7688841065128
Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide.	1699.7639390703953
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green.	1446.1695119249111
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	1513.0153073075219
Fergus’
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	1263.2297750733674
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	1585.5519880266854
Silent with awe and
pity I went to her bedside.	1196.2493783164057
She was crying in her wretched bed.	1616.6938340010122
For
those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.	721.5925010356215
Where now?	592.3640888758189
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	2066.549611116158
A birdcage hung in the
sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	1136.1410142245206
She heard old Royce sing
in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he
sang:
	1043.8364284507554
I am the boy
	803.3455444088341
That can enjoy
	946.4336915828404
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	1376.861144421135
And no more turn aside and brood.	716.0717362356347
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	1349.7775801663277
Memories beset his
brooding brain.	1376.8650244983396
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	1939.4757395650688
Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
shirts.	1782.5145741623624
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	1388.3091717902932
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	1734.7375146224579
On
me alone.	946.4248011905848
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	1512.13619067013
Ghostly light on the
tortured face.	1250.1352855543369
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
prayed on their knees.	1837.0818265545188
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	1547.9670740068523
_Liliata
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum
chorus excipiat._
	1597.9673729164892
Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
	841.8114424048898
No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	1190.1414750460071
—Kinch ahoy!
	592.3640888758189
Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.	1177.945600258105
It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again.	1366.7299407062008
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	1610.1149974924276
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	1124.5450060624537
Breakfast is ready.	737.2943990675084
Haines is
apologising for waking us last night.	1312.1612204006674
It’s all right.	348.34396156533904
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.	619.1667012986588
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
For my sake and for all our
sakes.	1393.124574922235
His head disappeared and reappeared.	1376.8650244983396
—I told him your symbol of Irish art.	1003.5073937287291
He says it’s very clever.	1334.8055300508101
Touch
him for a quid, will you?	757.4960524049296
A guinea, I mean.	592.3640888758189
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	885.1534237904042
—The school kip?	946.4292464214541
Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
How much?	592.3640888758189
Four quid?	592.3640888758189
Lend us one.	946.4348492096655
—If you want it, Stephen said.	748.7652472707106
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	676.810330698633
We’ll have
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	1747.812376173674
Four omnipotent
sovereigns.	946.4336915828404
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a Cockney accent:
	1490.634609848725
O, won’t we have a merry time,
	683.0783947276636
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
	878.3805381550931
On coronation,
	592.3640888758189
Coronation day!
	592.3640888758189
O, won’t we have a merry time
	683.0783947276636
On coronation day!
	647.1873352442567
The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet.	1299.3425005624924
Why should I bring it down?	749.4742172602536
Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?	1700.0541999709599
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	1688.899363225746
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	1196.2887854825774
I am another now
and yet the same.	1266.3179133775807
A servant too.	946.4336915828404
A server of a servant.	895.2197224380458
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow.	1546.6123592948964
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	1896.3629541406553
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	724.100360399574
Haines, open that door, will you?	1031.5052807476075
A tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.	1615.1026070576595
—Have you the key?	842.9996555529946
a voice asked.	598.0557567897114
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
Janey Mack, I’m choked!
	784.6746171349943
He howled, without looking up from the fire:
	730.6423560437592
—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	737.5069353195125
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	1932.929322964928
Haines stood at the
doorway, looking out.	1234.1690983563012
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him.	1148.185777727072
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.	1493.1005297620925
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	1570.240855278072
But, hush! Not a
word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	946.4305636296598
Haines, come in.	528.9529370108487
The grub is ready.	991.9824392102742
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
gifts.	1003.5136543574038
Where’s the sugar?	991.8237828705397
O, jay, there’s no milk.	1070.691850653141
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker.	1650.1169791947375
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	1076.481844159874
—What sort of a kip is this?	962.415799943907
I told her to come after eight.	1259.9310705530395
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	1003.5224923028728
There’s a lemon in the
locker.	1324.0436791180384
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	784.6690523475067
I want Sandycove
milk.	592.3640888758189
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
	845.0741838869244
—That woman is coming up with the milk.	1392.5722711382527
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair.	879.2919923435553
Sit down.	592.3640888758189
Pour out the tea there.	1185.1019094726355
The sugar is in the bag.	862.6243970059147
Here,
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	1584.4782351447343
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:
	1639.6922680789937
—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._
	592.3640888758189
Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	1183.2954238577272
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.	1152.6481510108863
But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?	875.0632575583672
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
woman’s wheedling voice:
	1587.9063527850171
—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	841.8087344744109
And when I
makes water I makes water.	706.1565772035038
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	724.1670767226112
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
	1322.6279686447779
—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.	698.039766838391
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
send you don’t make them in the one pot._
	989.9948232827046
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.	1887.169705662327
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	1306.6225489654498
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	1232.9419047496435
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:
	1462.0750022467346
—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	1025.0056047521155
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	748.7527617590948
—Do you now?	737.2909362695849
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	639.3698090205396
Your reasons, pray?	946.4336915828404
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion.	981.2414239655104
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	1039.413688448304
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.	1030.7650381502704
—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	1661.3107380862266
Do you think she was?	909.6830568201376
Quite charming!
	592.3640888758189
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
	2001.170800029932
_—For old Mary Ann
	592.3640888758189
She doesn’t care a damn.	1334.591600757803
But, hising up her petticoats..._
	1512.1122568908556
He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	1692.1965323714937
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	1700.0147623380526
—The milk, sir!
	946.4336915828404
—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.	748.7545201171381
Kinch, get the jug.	1196.2412508091231
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.	1112.8184044669413
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	972.9509764663954
Glory be to God.	592.3640888758189
—To whom?	592.3640888758189
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	1020.2688583742237
Ah, to be sure!
	568.2162529096959
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	1470.7243264713015
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.	1045.0403206198087
—How much, sir?	946.4336915828404
—A quart, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers.	2047.4705807404073
Old shrunken paps.	946.4336915828404
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger.	1945.9467220889885
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	1442.6478146827637
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	2148.854398103011
They
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	1767.7135288462603
Silk of the kine and
poor old woman, names given her in old times.	1540.8366526505638
A wandering crone, lowly
form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	2148.590319425716
To serve or to
upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	1817.1467993182387
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	1262.7534703951196
—Taste it, sir, she said.	563.8403996514123
He drank at her bidding.	1376.770023988661
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts.	1550.3941715274207
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.	2047.0105501818784
—Are you a medical student, sir?	1512.0783238508939
the old woman asked.	988.3783520071005
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.	724.1084873131331
—Look at that now, she said.	907.3737733777249
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	1376.861144421135
She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights.	2021.7790386285135
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.	1747.8301400503753
And to the loud voice that now bids
her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	2002.5632863900705
—Do you understand what he says?	997.7457040242911
Stephen asked her.	647.1751766753763
—Is it French you are talking, sir?	972.1963938362555
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	1496.5815896041718
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
Is there Gaelic on you?	553.4378924634711
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	784.7956763357622
Are you from the
west, sir?	1334.1034414107073
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	592.3640888758189
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
Irish in Ireland.	837.228233335331
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
the language myself.	992.2801439250375
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.	1424.2039391258497
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	1106.4172860135138
Wonderful entirely.	592.3640888758189
Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch.	1082.0116790467187
Would you like a cup, ma’am?	1156.9303122526253
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	1288.3162921526584
Haines said to her:
	568.2580355066788
—Have you your bill?	1196.2896284392518
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?	1018.0408414837765
—Bill, sir?	592.3640888758189
she said, halting.	1421.4289393314414
Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	2014.8957620500053
That’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	1588.4755544969546
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
his trouser pockets.	1581.0100923547018
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	946.5565377586493
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk.	2003.0243498399532
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:
	1522.3653374815792
—A miracle!
	592.3640888758189
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
	1072.988968275695
All I can give you I give.	615.2656732271747
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	1699.9252744481803
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.	702.7130549393063
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	1237.646632159616
Time enough.	592.3640888758189
Good
morning, sir.	737.2918380794588
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
	1196.2920839605315
_—Heart of my heart, were it more,
	1298.5205273677502
More would be laid at your feet._
	1700.0256447623938
He turned to Stephen and said:
	559.7583937287142
—Seriously, Dedalus.	592.3640888758189
I’m stony.	946.4336915828404
Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money.	1686.999083101798
Today the bards must drink and junket.	1305.276211649817
Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.	1747.8408670635938
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today.	1141.5163399434036
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
	885.1480785295871
Then he said to Haines:
	553.6928307231734
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	1525.2707316850767
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.	1136.2934923546673
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
	1840.9404027873766
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	1339.6362204248067
Speaking to me.	374.58535743395163
They wash and tub and scrub.	1512.1246122890575
Yet here’s a spot.	1095.944907776243
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good.	1199.5522959349134
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
warmth of tone:
	1085.2341050770403
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	767.1077975211829
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	784.6735115072871
I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	1588.6275437674135
—Would I make any money by it?	1322.6505465697828
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:
	1553.5583955362897
—I don’t know, I’m sure.	603.8743222310895
He strolled out to the doorway.	716.4719963998704
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
and said with coarse vigour:
	979.3366398421798
—You put your hoof in it now.	1237.5157997463089
What did you say that for?	1103.5968134450964
Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
The problem is to get money.	1334.7229548185028
From whom?	592.3640888758189
From the
milkwoman or from him.	1177.958975023317
It’s a toss up, I think.	885.0658628825299
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	1467.6012483593695
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	1112.7974360321798
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.	968.0846531869589
—From me, Kinch, he said.	363.3982156167861
In a suddenly changed tone he added:
	1452.7078434998086
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.	670.70380267817
Damn all else they
are good for.	1452.6451399452928
Why don’t you play them as I do?	715.0878803340293
To hell with them all.	815.1683657191629
Let us get out of the kip.	759.0692750232071
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:
	1734.0060070352235
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	683.671792623458
—There’s your snotrag, he said.	796.1347774458856
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	1947.402374657346
His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	2002.8700479970003
God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character.	1432.964120070099
I want puce gloves and green
boots.	1452.69830879911
Do I contradict myself?	698.0360971394099
Very well then, I
contradict myself.	660.8681600265427
Mercurial Malachi.	592.3640888758189
A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.	1377.0229622441045
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	635.6403897219162
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	724.838272602743
Haines called to them from the
doorway:
	1053.9675833718347
—Are you coming, you fellows?	1376.8572642759873
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	702.8738309027268
Come out,
Kinch.	592.3640888758189
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	757.7385833440167
Resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
	1682.8391377860028
—And going forth he met Butterly.	946.4336915828393
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it.	1696.1801256489323
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
	610.461974143016
—Did you bring the key?	1040.6234827733508
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	885.1534237904042
He walked on.	647.1698887573939
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	1511.9923372775575
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
	611.5129455709882
Haines asked:
	592.3640888758189
—Do you pay rent for this tower?	1452.6815222643463
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	805.8139436247167
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
	1191.2526184698168
—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	885.1480785295871
Martello you call it?	581.4703390158298
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea.	645.0087072436926
But ours is the _omphalos_.	1376.5756775398402
—What is your idea of Hamlet?	946.4203554835648
Haines asked Stephen.	592.3640888758189
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	885.149860352047
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	1343.3426640658467
Wait till I
have a few pints in me first.	1228.3870913003768
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:
	1556.8498966731643
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	1149.6278360875422
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	1344.9802817989716
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	885.1534237904042
Is it some paradox?	1196.2938424605543
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	1003.524259793509
It’s quite simple.	1196.281199670174
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.	933.5753391664331
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	1081.9948206715394
He himself?	592.3640888758189
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
	1285.8062830666365
—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
	835.101827093437
—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	774.3341684683643
And it is
rather long to tell.	1234.4958675527175
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	1146.5506174311327
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	916.873613551832
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	1232.518422092174
_That
beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?	1060.6732385987593
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
not speak.	1104.0515926680127
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	1568.230101170651
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	1263.4925748695098
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the Muglins.	1938.7662798002675
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	1748.2853957901423
The Father and the Son idea.	592.3640888758189
The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father.	1106.3775052818949
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	1646.4221020909608
He looked
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	1785.646476524657
_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	1646.5617446637611
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.	1299.5239015842478
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	724.1084873131331
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._
	913.8024694346365
He held up a forefinger of warning.	1452.6370052748007
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again._
	1217.1178144449457
He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
	1708.4388936886921
_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	629.0941871078323
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy...	1058.9347495715306
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_
	991.9789448889109
He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	1828.4163391267366
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:
	1057.419432560624
—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.	752.1053935511144
He’s rather blasphemous.	1196.2896282679212
I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say.	832.8883159188116
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn’t it?	1181.2368269569708
What did he call it?	1095.9986280826681
Joseph the Joiner?	592.3640888758189
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	724.1084873131331
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	1182.5244585600742
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	871.397702089677
—You’re not a believer, are you?	961.8981380510623
Haines asked.	592.3640888758189
I mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word.	1123.0876482430895
Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God.	1293.21646776902
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	975.885752560784
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
green stone.	2002.958467865084
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	1205.7608702967923
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	972.1901265661828
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	1548.0964693238939
He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	1629.9547079919253
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	872.6488973605259
Either you believe or
you don’t, isn’t it?	915.7117542786442
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal God.	1274.7988695937393
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?	1003.7183716314995
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought.	1512.1286717712974
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
side.	1695.030379468745
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	1575.5128446270628
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
along the path.	1087.847587297008
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	1082.941954418174
He wants that key.	1196.2980565823661
It is mine.	737.2874734175336
I paid the rent.	991.975450508825
Now I eat his salt
bread.	1196.299461264378
Give him the key too.	1185.1679129090458
He will ask for it.	870.0558279578343
That was in his
eyes.	410.9133186930142
—After all, Haines began...	592.3640888758189
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
not all unkind.	1933.7563394492936
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	1449.0673251200687
You are your
own master, it seems to me.	978.7400378051159
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
Italian.	885.1331644687742
Haines said.	592.3640888758189
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	1512.1246122890575
Kneel down before me.	991.9719563386063
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	1406.9838438597428
Haines said again.	737.2840105113547
What do you mean?	545.112375743011
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	1147.6175283162556
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.	1795.571750596852
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	1299.2079100536127
An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay.	841.8114424048898
We feel in England that we have treated you
rather unfairly.	1149.6419350372964
It seems history is to blame.	677.1455960789835
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	1998.3871358187155
Symbol of the apostles in the mass
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	1818.7950672414597
A horde of heresies
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	963.1004617439717
Words Mulligan had spoken
a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	1500.086267520288
Idle mockery.	592.3640888758189
The void
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
shields.	1760.7194438946453
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	592.3640888758189
_Zut! Nom de Dieu!_
	592.3640888758189
—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.	861.7585425994416
I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	911.1192351938856
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.	1067.3811271144834
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,
boatman.	1484.3888930590883
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	1795.0728378816073
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.	871.3652580056023
It’ll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one.	1775.7078444555302
It’s nine days today.	1376.8572642759873
The man that was drowned.	895.8685376613132
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
saltwhite.	1861.927030189729
Here I am.	592.3640888758189
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	1390.88707941032
Buck Mulligan stood
on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his
shoulder.	1303.2491096792498
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly
frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	1846.6946440334434
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?	946.4421263271636
—Down in Westmeath.	592.3640888758189
With the Bannons.	592.3640888758189
—Still there?	592.3640888758189
I got a card from Bannon.	946.3887486591059
Says he found a sweet young
thing down there.	1456.098910533236
Photo girl he calls her.	1020.3515443626613
—Snapshot, eh?	592.3640888758189
Brief exposure.	592.3640888758189
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	1004.9895290880557
An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face.	1636.8790851855806
He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.	1853.423529460754
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
lips and breastbone.	1337.8497526323881
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock.	1616.8744621661247
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	1299.2781618953723
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
—Going over next week to stew.	1512.1281635529294
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	724.103117601836
—Spooning with him last night on the pier.	1409.4661846155796
The father is rotto with
money.	1512.1290884927746
—Is she up the pole?	1376.7193979119616
—Better ask Seymour that.	592.3640888758189
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	724.1055721776142
—Redheaded women buck like goats.	1376.8650244983396
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	1911.3005915330764
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	1234.3422107900892
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen.	673.1147743861916
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.	1409.7480779096322
—Are you going in here, Malachi?	946.4247277163993
Make room in the bed.	542.2284621125085
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	1569.5275656019267
Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.	1048.6709355918454
Buck Mulligan asked.	592.3640888758189
—Later on, Haines said.	592.3640888758189
Not on my breakfast.	1196.206603220502
Stephen turned away.	946.415910520381
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	1133.3496859890734
Stephen handed him the key.	713.096842887211
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.	1426.0980585315194
—And twopence, he said, for a pint.	1173.0099333571397
Throw it there.	737.2805475510427
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	1547.8018131821316
Dressing, undressing.	592.3640888758189
Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
	1413.8999496325619
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	878.1478529742943
Thus spake
Zarathustra.	592.3640888758189
His plump body plunged.	1196.3022706333559
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
path and smiling at wild Irish.	1085.6677337356227
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	1344.8546625620584
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	592.3640888758189
Half twelve.	592.3640888758189
—Good, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	1250.3977297144077
Liliata rutilantium.	592.3640888758189
Turma circumdet.	592.3640888758189
Iubilantium te virginum.	647.1873352442567
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	1910.9491382135577
Home also I cannot go.	784.6746171349943
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	1004.3797363412473
Turning
the curve he waved his hand.	1202.5929139355205
It called again.	946.4336915828404
A sleek brown head, a
seal’s, far out on the water, round.	1545.7430021862654
—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	907.083935284893
—Tarentum, sir.	592.3640888758189
—Very good.	592.3640888758189
—There was a battle, sir.	1376.574856495803
—Very good.	592.3640888758189
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.	1767.7260431782954
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	1023.151993457931
And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it.	1478.8188738873002
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame.	1331.2951575313673
What’s left us then?	1376.8456240639034
—I forget the place, sir.	1376.8163454064954
279 B.	592.3640888758189
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
gorescarred book.	1469.5172511073272
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
for._
	1230.1987398138067
That phrase the world had remembered.	1512.2484004885953
From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear.	2047.5376232728927
Any general to any officers.	1376.8378625310465
They lend ear.	946.4336915828404
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	605.6206221140251
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?	592.3640888758189
—I know, sir.	946.4336915828404
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	592.3640888758189
You, Armstrong.	592.3640888758189
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	835.3826490099997
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel.	1196.2904706083634
He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	1911.335991431323
Crumbs adhered
to the tissue of his lips.	1275.2406834716803
A sweetened boy’s breath.	1376.8349931155365
Welloff people,
proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	1261.3127694800073
Vico Road, Dalkey.	592.3640888758189
—Pyrrhus, sir?	592.3640888758189
Pyrrhus, a pier.	737.2909362695849
All laughed.	592.3640888758189
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	1196.3022706333559
Armstrong looked round
at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	1692.1493002912534
In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	1850.8005305847971
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
what is a pier.	1316.4891859300574
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	592.3640888758189
A thing out in the water.	790.389422385101
A kind of a
bridge.	794.053475850101
Kingstown pier, sir.	946.4292464214541
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	1616.8090754835305
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	1767.7502314191693
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	903.1081299972379
Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
tittering in the struggle.	2026.9114979560138
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	1196.3022706333559
The words troubled their gaze.	1185.2823396500055
—How, sir?	592.3640888758189
Comyn asked.	592.3640888758189
A bridge is across a river.	1512.1281636973065
For Haines’s chapbook.	841.8114424048898
No-one here to hear.	971.1334121655151
Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	1765.7437147459714
What then?	592.3640888758189
Why had they chosen all that part?	1452.6843808615968
For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	2047.5585214651765
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death.	1241.3069742905552
Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted.	1779.4530927606866
But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were?	1870.9761341632195
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	1496.587386200745
Weave, weaver of the wind.	970.5318843747532
—Tell us a story, sir.	1185.21305816455
—O, do, sir.	647.1903747676978
A ghoststory.	592.3640888758189
—Where do you begin in this?	1334.8863872274096
Stephen asked, opening another book.	1376.8650244983396
—Go on then, Talbot.	592.3640888758189
—And the story, sir?	991.975450508825
—After, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
Go on, Talbot.	592.3640888758189
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel.	1933.6375373123058
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
	1870.8953586922096
_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._
	1150.2740423181601
It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	1259.7030020523287
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where
he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	1415.2772716006305
By his
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	1275.237173954207
Fed and feeding
brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating
feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	2218.4267688542836
Thought
is the thought of thought.	1334.4049884234
Tranquil brightness.	592.3640888758189
The soul is in a manner
all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	1115.765565040003
Tranquility sudden, vast,
candescent: form of forms.	1124.7678641317796
Talbot repeated:
	592.3640888758189
_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
	791.5428638268393
Through the dear might..._
	1185.2622984166494
—Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	570.6236605532046
I don’t see anything.	1001.5731643734608
—What, sir?	592.3640888758189
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	1376.8650244983396
His hand turned the page over.	1512.0935758338449
He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered.	1351.5413105142898
Of him that walked the waves.	797.2833139758249
Here also over these
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and
on mine.	1755.821233217184
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute.	1872.923494548504
To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s.	592.3640888758197
A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
church’s looms.	2083.4622914832344
Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	1512.1317148251362
My father gave me seeds to sow.	1616.8140704597195
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	1548.0588225553631
—Have I heard all?	841.8114424048898
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
Hockey at ten, sir.	991.9789448889109
—Half day, sir.	737.2918380794588
—Who can answer a riddle?	1185.2789995483442
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	1767.7688841065128
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:
	1871.0774890473344
—A riddle, sir?	946.4336915828404
Ask me, sir.	528.9653583798028
—O, ask me, sir.	581.494364640215
—This is the riddle, Stephen said:
	748.6233927410699
The cock crew,
	946.4336915828404
The sky was blue:
	1196.2938424605543
The bells in heaven
	699.0476846265252
Were striking eleven.	647.1903747676978
’Tis time for this poor soul
	1334.591795376112
To go to heaven.	991.919201848287
—What, sir?	592.3640888758189
—Again, sir.	592.3640888758189
We didn’t hear.	633.9495241316795
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	1767.5447923947793
After a silence
Cochrane said:
	592.3640888758189
—What is it, sir?	1196.403622520778
We give it up.	456.4498761982876
Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
	1376.8427535862386
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	1548.0534493143641
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.	1536.504778384262
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
	1364.6386004238404
They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	1532.2196079016926
Quickly
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
clamour of their boots and tongues.	1911.2551622078288
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook.	1911.335473489759
On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail’s bed.	1832.1042878417143
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	1089.1601489372226
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
blind loops and a blot.	1602.3777902648137
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	1055.9090144537827
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
to you, sir.	1382.4133308913574
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	1048.330535752784
—Do you understand how to do them now?	1409.6568184578066
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	748.7545201171381
Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir.	1344.8972513947647
—Can you do them yourself?	1376.8361452285467
—No, sir.	592.3640888758189
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail’s bed.	1571.7688317406105
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart.	1430.1541727689796
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	1637.9838999751864
She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own.	1686.7738499709594
Was that then real?	1196.2896282679212
The only true thing in
life?	777.2844285465959
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode.	1344.9502718834747
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	1732.541680748096
She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	1873.3826686513632
A poor
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	1909.3588857671496
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	871.3100481267367
He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.	835.3414534047658
Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses.	1616.7804924631705
Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	1750.2926849253145
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	2126.2703406527157
Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	1479.8563875767056
Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.	1525.8972066987494
—Do you understand now?	1196.2968198958201
Can you work the second for yourself?	1452.6762424120636
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	1003.524259793509
Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	1998.0976617458734
_Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive.	1305.2867215594392
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	2099.0615270425556
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	1106.4301849033661
My
childhood bends beside me.	1376.861144421135
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly.	1632.854780490493
Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	1801.396339922092
The sum was done.	991.9684619306007
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	710.5089364182518
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
Thanks, Sargent answered.	592.3640888758189
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	1746.0214543045818
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.	1256.0802976634968
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	1387.184900115701
—Run on, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
Mr Deasy is calling you.	1039.41860477134
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife.	1804.191233743523
They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	1512.1293474056583
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
him.	1226.48269633925
He turned his angry white moustache.	1512.113958547462
—What is it now?	621.372524073536
he cried continually without listening.	2083.257025853516
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	741.9014369605401
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
order here.	967.550945949436
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
cried sternly:
	1718.3890489198966
—What is the matter?	822.3495200192032
What is it now?	621.372524073536
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
illdyed head.	2013.1872689659222
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
leather of its chairs.	1638.042439556933
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	1346.8857433260125
As it was in the beginning, is now.	703.3884096269086
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	1306.3383317323232
And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without end.	1730.0958600236786
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	1337.0058353959012
Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	789.7608272228356
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.	932.9808277626616
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	1407.6028723903032
It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table.	1456.393530353058
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	1768.1759488081773
And now his strongroom for the gold.	1156.8197692282267
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James.	2066.65954929034
An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead
treasure, hollow shells.	1626.5785949989172
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	1836.4742867556513
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	942.2025615370324
These are handy things to have.	1250.4106898076125
This is for sovereigns.	1196.3010339675943
This is
for shillings.	1196.3010339675943
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	592.3640888758189
And here crowns.	946.4336915828404
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	1432.9943128377577
—Three twelve, he said.	457.04336643229624
I think you’ll find that’s right.	935.6375110180295
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	1210.435324459361
You have earned it.	1196.3022706333559
Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	1418.2970265090166
Symbols too
of beauty and of power.	1305.2849757364302
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
and misery.	1870.9760325242876
You’ll pull it out somewhere
and lose it.	1626.6206816233391
You just buy one of these machines.	1189.5597733448667
You’ll find them very
handy.	1512.1210612500947
Answer something.	592.3640888758189
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	885.1354136893032
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	1105.1746331816666
Three times
now.	946.4336915828404
Three nooses round me here.	1096.1097349211489
I can break them in this instant
if I will.	1196.2702297144758
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	874.2850254370967
You don’t
know yet what money is.	1216.615530158744
Money is power.	946.4336915828404
When you have lived as long as
I have.	911.3909787849431
I know, I know.	592.3640888758189
If youth but knew.	822.5560693485747
But what does Shakespeare
say?	592.3640888758189
_Put but money in thy purse._
	1616.8195509831073
—Iago, Stephen murmured.	592.3640888758189
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.	1508.1327737255158
—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	841.8088631987181
He made money.	946.4336915828404
A poet, yes, but
an Englishman too.	885.1462967107119
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	638.7811744861884
Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
mouth?	1130.0040029696752
The seas’ ruler.	946.4292464214541
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	1499.7522605219965
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	1109.8982215685135
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	592.3640888758189
That’s not English.	592.3640888758189
A French Celt said that.	624.6737324671168
He
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	1616.7804945806408
—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	1203.5148298358765
_I paid
my way._
	1001.297246356385
Good man, good man.	991.9649674638666
_—I paid my way.	533.1617683543355
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
that?	1183.5227428153955
_I owe nothing._ Can you?	748.7545201171381
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	1686.8349042010932
Curran, ten guineas.	946.4336915828404
McCann, one guinea.	946.4215135713408
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	633.0210592346853
Temple, two lunches.	946.4336915828404
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
weeks’ board.	739.5765342506055
The lump I have is useless.	946.4336915828393
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	748.736040378397
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	1470.2829204190696
—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously.	1209.1483701166437
But one day you must feel it.	1373.7528633459467
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	1871.024679399011
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	1344.9703948476772
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
Wales.	1236.5772344106208
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	1618.0946899186483
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.	870.8414250817003
I remember the famine
in ’46.	946.4070184424706
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your
communion denounced him as a demagogue?	1553.0405064984468
You fenians forget some things.	1376.8650244983396
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	1376.8572642759873
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	1133.336946185973
Hoarse, masked and armed, the
planters’ covenant.	1616.8260600451579
The black north and true blue bible.	1616.8185959602772
Croppies lie
down.	737.2909362695849
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	1376.833981978199
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	1039.4024932875066
On the spindle side.	1196.3022706333559
But
I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	1069.7199700519482
We are
all Irish, all kings’ sons.	714.5984127974934
—Alas, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so.	941.6038720956611
Lal the ral the ra
	812.3000287389235
The rocky road to Dublin.	784.6724058811368
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	1700.070883610277
Soft day, sir John!
Soft day, your honour!...	664.7353654405769
Two topboots jog dangling on
to Dublin.	1082.0154678135393
Lal the ral the ra.	812.3000287389235
Lal the ral the raddy.	1096.1167169915855
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	592.3640888758189
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends.	1219.1249553605694
I have a letter here for the press.	1299.2025997198266
Sit down a moment.	698.1114746716282
I have just to copy the end.	1260.0687474243593
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	1920.9032001901635
—Sit down.	592.3640888758189
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
common sense._ Just a moment.	1008.7632571712656
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	2048.3920947845663
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	1699.9795981815157
Framed
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of
Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de
Paris_, 1866.	1053.0605064834713
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	1547.4411890043525
He saw their
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
crowds.	2026.2231469893984
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	885.1498603158275
_But prompt ventilation of this
allimportant question..._
	1700.026948437438
Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush.	2068.334093672298
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to
one the field.	662.9758976237482
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	1747.2304088857609
Again: a goal.	946.4336915828404
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life.	1580.4052973864527
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling
who seems to be slightly crawsick?	1747.354127435157
Time shocked rebounds, shock
by shock.	1512.138816961438
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of
the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.	2018.4471349174598
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	660.8666080985872
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	1120.353335708601
Stephen stood up.	556.5679096831182
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	1122.1949955950809
It’s about the
foot and mouth disease.	642.813818757292
There can be no two
opinions on the matter.	1318.3353758660537
May I trespass on your valuable space.	1067.7811087278571
That doctrine of _laissez faire_
which so often in our history.	1871.0463295558957
Our cattle trade.	946.4336915828404
The way of all our old
industries.	1305.2506921645054
Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.	1003.5224923028716
European conflagration.	592.3640888758189
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
channel.	1512.384275396189
The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
agriculture.	1699.3931195429152
Pardoned a classical allusion.	1196.3022706333559
By a woman who
was no better than she should be.	978.2034373608203
To come to the point at issue.	1093.6825258626652
—I don’t mince words, do I?	1082.261200276417
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	615.2669116519531
Foot and mouth disease.	563.460564284891
Known as Koch’s preparation.	784.6746171349943
Serum and virus.	946.4336915828404
Percentage of salted horses.	1196.2980565823646
Veterinary surgeons.	592.3640888758189
Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	592.3640888758189
Courteous
offer a fair trial.	1020.332129651682
Dictates of common sense.	991.9754505088239
Allimportant question.	592.3640888758189
In
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	1043.6342799302079
Thanking you for
the hospitality of your columns.	1278.0213310259514
—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	882.8702211171195
You will see at the
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	1438.348654942767
And it can be
cured.	1376.8127193963714
It is cured.	946.4336915828404
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	1240.8088544445973
They
offer to come over here.	1512.1120722551263
I am trying to work up influence with the
department.	1691.638102086718
Now I’m going to try publicity.	1030.7606249730625
I am surrounded by
difficulties, by...	1512.1317147529485
intrigues by...	2415.9788711002393
backstairs influence by...	2415.9788711002393
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	1837.1166714921337
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	417.84292854885445
England is in the hands of the
jews.	672.0805932878453
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	1767.6870369321296
And they are
the signs of a nation’s decay.	1569.4267885575105
Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation’s vital strength.	1870.9803429145163
I have seen it coming these years.	1616.8097869429505
As sure as
we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction.	1959.352407886483
Old England is dying.	841.8114424048898
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam.	1933.8509822047647
He faced about and back again.	1103.6558593969683
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	1372.3948167202811
Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.	660.8681600265427
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.	1735.6004152518651
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not?	1767.735641628463
And you can see
the darkness in their eyes.	1376.860724429236
And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day.	1495.634787986043
Gabble of geese.	946.4336915828404
They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats.	1976.267712258873
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	1700.0678893036238
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
zeal was vain.	2033.3663433826262
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	1512.138816961438
Time surely would
scatter all.	1376.8650244983396
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	1569.7484506228272
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
dishonours of their flesh.	2002.9349741799708
Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
—What do you mean?	545.112375743011
Mr Deasy asked.	592.3640888758189
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	1066.6483490541743
His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly.	1512.138816961438
Is this old wisdom?	1196.2980565823646
He waits to hear from
me.	1023.4740156835234
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	1125.2097557986444
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	1700.0549339533122
A whirring whistle: goal.	1196.2980565823646
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	1767.6857580715175
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	719.1688302647998
All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	1375.0745346322433
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
	1474.102747703536
—That is God.	592.3640888758189
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
	592.3640888758189
Mr Deasy asked.	592.3640888758189
—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	848.6696864180457
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers.	1452.5619592984415
Looking up again he set them free.	1616.8017188610554
—I am happier than you are, he said.	956.8749265276608
We have committed many errors and
many sins.	1700.0619006452653
A woman brought sin into the world.	612.8731084100812
For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
years the Greeks made war on Troy.	810.7399537358777
A faithless wife first brought the
strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	1156.1980365602244
A woman too brought Parnell low.	748.7527617590948
Many
errors, many failures but not the one sin.	1626.4659979051614
I am a struggler now at the
end of my days.	1068.6255676467852
But I will fight for the right till the end.	1187.2773628258547
For Ulster will fight
	841.8084770704346
And Ulster will be right.	1039.3825287201369
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	682.7363175368896
—Well, sir, he began.	899.6094822950894
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
this work.	1237.0922078939338
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	911.8217025672279
Perhaps I am
wrong.	841.8114424048898
—A learner rather, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
And here what will you learn more?	1323.7756860680472
Mr Deasy shook his head.	490.41362742750636
—Who knows?	592.3640888758189
To learn one must be humble.	1512.0159538224243
But life is the great
teacher.	1334.3343935194184
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	1185.2698489280301
—As regards these, he began.	1096.1263603411965
—Yes, Mr Deasy said.	592.3640888758189
You have two copies there.	1376.8650244983396
If you can have them
published at once.	1327.506304210046
_ Telegraph.	592.3640888758189
Irish Homestead._
	592.3640888758189
—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	1109.946377980329
I know two
editors slightly.	1376.8650244983396
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	724.1084873131331
I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P.	809.5790022862059
There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
City Arms hotel.	1188.0855914636934
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	1569.9477095340267
You
see if you can get it into your two papers.	1170.4408483952636
What are they?	528.9628741836711
_—The Evening Telegraph..._
	592.3640888758189
—That will do, Mr Deasy said.	592.3640888758189
There is no time to lose.	1334.5984411150857
Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin.	1584.6138360735554
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	744.0484588360056
Thank you.	592.3640888758189
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	1106.7197444189055
I
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	1344.975785278228
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	1275.0917519194152
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	1620.0515734864696
The
lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors.	1547.4209928951254
Still I will help him in his fight.	1168.629477290954
Mulligan will
dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	1692.1271636782935
—Mr Dedalus!
	592.3640888758189
Running after me.	737.2849123494218
No more letters, I hope.	592.3640888758189
—Just one moment.	593.5229010712899
—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	923.6648806985854
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	1332.1946916389677
—I just wanted to say, he said.	686.3214494056971
Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	1701.2440464865992
Do you know
that?	460.2673985545048
And do you know why?	585.2356915506325
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	1452.4014847221483
—Why, sir?	592.3640888758189
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	1376.8194713003752
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	740.7269208124281
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm.	1933.8344582492773
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.	1430.2658946601375
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	1905.8512840795356
That’s why.	737.2933828658961
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.	2002.9023102800068
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes.	1650.7349884093412
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	1483.8571892293562
Snotgreen, bluesilver,
rust: coloured signs.	1376.8650244983396
Limits of the diaphane.	991.1977273031595
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	1871.082350955651
By
knocking his sconce against them, sure.	1616.8260600451579
Go easy.	592.3640888758189
Bald he was and a
millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	1439.1733654047061
Limit of the diaphane in.	1184.5321822051937
Why in?	592.3640888758189
Diaphane, adiaphane.	592.3640888758189
If you can put your five fingers through
it it is a gate, if not a door.	1726.1115155265954
Shut your eyes and see.	1020.2667351400736
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
shells.	1448.3368739164425
You are walking through it howsomever.	1512.1281635529294
I am, a stride at a
time.	1054.2913458539224
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	1738.0839548114984
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable
modality of the audible.	996.1861128777756
Open your eyes.	946.4226712477422
Jesus! If I fell over a
cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_
ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	1222.4221117289446
My ash sword hangs at
my side.	1452.7041571062439
Tap with it: they do.	1040.601493346542
My two feet in his boots are at the ends
of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	1541.4078539318675
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los
Demiurgos_.	1106.1689011150463
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	841.8069943769832
Crush,
crack, crick, crick.	1196.3022706333559
Wild sea money.	946.4336915828404
Dominie Deasy kens them a’.	1039.3871444212211
Won’t you come to Sandymount,
	749.5451508227693
Rhythm begins, you see.	638.3463744024033
I hear.	592.3640888758189
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs
marching.	1512.138816961438
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	1376.8650244983396
Open your eyes now.	1196.291823252409
I will.	592.3640888758189
One moment.	592.3640888758189
Has all vanished since?	1196.3022706333559
If I
open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	1169.986089594996
_Basta!_ I will see if I
can see.	809.5603760658395
See now.	592.3640888758189
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
without end.	994.5104627604754
They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently,
_Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed
feet sinking in the silted sand.	1277.5638221132363
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our
mighty mother.	1067.3689377522774
Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s
gamp poked in the beach.	1691.1042882146003
From the liberties, out for the day.	777.3992302693802
Mrs
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of
Bride Street.	706.5939408546302
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	1767.5593258545864
Creation from nothing.	946.4292464214541
What has she in the bag?	1040.0726066457357
A misbirth with a
trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	1823.2549481348617
The cords of all link back,
strandentwining cable of all flesh.	1871.085956992658
That is why mystic monks.	1376.8572642759873
Will you
be as gods?	1185.2489365714914
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	1196.2413429956325
Kinch here.	592.3640888758189
Put me on to
Edenville.	675.4956636264213
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	1376.8650244983396
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	692.5044133719111
She had no navel.	1196.272770789106
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,
whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
everlasting.	1768.0108826650655
Womb of sin.	556.5706012132994
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	1196.2736117466036
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will.	1767.7267600610937
From before the ages
He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	1556.9954046613905
A _lex eterna_ stays
about Him.	946.4336915828393
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
consubstantial?	1064.0195795182333
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	1003.5078327157654
Warring
his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	1108.9853705946132
Illstarred
heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	1122.239936342738
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	2112.8781526395446
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	1700.0460487536634
They are coming, waves.	1196.2980565823646
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
Mananaan.	1293.4744028585194
I mustn’t forget his letter for the press.	1280.7990230144549
And after?	592.3640888758189
The Ship, half
twelve.	698.0360971394099
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	1588.4403322897078
Yes, I must.	592.3640888758189
His pace slackened.	946.4336915828404
Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not?	946.4315755820971
My
consubstantial father’s voice.	943.5374601665626
Did you see anything of your artist
brother Stephen lately?	1109.9026208395242
Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace
with his aunt Sally?	847.6034706008837
Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	1585.6095711575858
And
and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	861.859109997951
O, weeping God, the
things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	885.1746575383669
The drunken little
costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	1569.92018094408
Highly respectable
gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	841.8044467310717
Yes,
sir.	592.3640888758189
No, sir.	592.3640888758189
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
	972.1773886333722
I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	1747.7744040211717
They take
me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	1649.3824328258765
—Let him in.	647.1933621212474
Let Stephen in.	592.3640888758189
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	1003.524259793509
—We thought you were someone else.	1056.8743561561098
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over
the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	1668.663134662634
He has washed
the upper moiety.	1512.1281635529294
—Morrow, nephew.	592.3640888758189
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the
eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	1380.6497628132206
A bogoak frame over his
bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_.	964.3866586053888
The drone of his misleading whistle
brings Walter back.	1017.8526109221142
—Yes, sir?	592.3640888758189
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother.	724.1070297587211
Where is she?	593.4838720831418
—Bathing Crissie, sir.	592.3640888758189
Papa’s little bedpal.	1196.2854140044617
Lump of love.	593.5326230218669
—No, uncle Richie...	592.3640888758189
—Call me Richie.	592.3640888758189
Damn your lithia water.	1196.3022706333559
It lowers.	592.3640888758189
—Uncle Richie, really...	592.3640888758189
—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.	1021.836175908079
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	1250.254727847876
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	1278.4232356980021
—He has nowhere to put it, you mug.	1393.1617079867017
Bring in our chippendale chair.	1376.8262206686227
Would you like a bite of something?	1287.5941635514903
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
here.	1616.6989827103623
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?	1766.4463382856516
So much the
better.	899.5583936557089
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	1178.333335730583
_All’erta!_
	946.4336915828404
He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_.	1106.4301849033661
The grandest number,
Stephen, in the whole opera.	749.0198633544619
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the
air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	2002.7423021181671
This wind is sweeter.	1196.3022706333559
Houses of decay, mine, his and all.	1323.766474567825
You told the Clongowes gentry you
had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.	1297.3111071924955
Come out of
them, Stephen.	553.8674695124269
Beauty is not there.	899.5343468758986
For
whom?	592.3640888758189
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	1616.1024337904573
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	592.3640888758189
The oval equine
faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws.	681.772003416944
Abbas father,
furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?	1871.0277743503925
Paff! _Descende,
calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.	1322.66050282485
A garland of grey hair on his
comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
(_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	1765.2594965617504
Get down,
baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the
altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their
albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of
wheat.	1776.0697651079972
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
it.	1415.479561410001
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	1484.4555548068736
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
cheek.	1648.295164772798
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	1039.41860477134
Dan Occam thought of that,
invincible doctor.	1082.806557065193
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
his brain.	1277.4800983134046
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
in diphthong.	2017.500841627745
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	945.2490840469893
You were
awfully holy, weren’t you?	1095.08548658771
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
might not have a red nose.	1126.4311331324857
_O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags
pinned round a squaw.	1557.056251949084
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth
tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about
that, eh?	802.6892835529889
What about what?	946.4336915828404
What else were they invented for?	1512.0926497010419
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	1823.8503051903576
I was young.	737.2805475510427
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
earnestly, striking face.	1729.336578958386
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one
saw: tell no-one.	818.3140346242769
Books you were going to write with letters for
titles.	1188.129933479176
Have you read his F?	784.6713463521713
O yes, but I prefer Q.	592.3640888758189
Yes, but W is
wonderful.	784.6746171349943
O yes, W.	592.3640888758189
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval
leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great
libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	1663.884909131346
Someone was to read them
there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	1837.0191943206307
Pico della
Mirandola like.	592.3640888758189
Ay, very like a whale.	1376.5686320155517
When one reads these strange
pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who
once...	2001.497669934725
The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	1392.2254185232762
His boots trod again a
damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	1852.3404258984358
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
midden of man’s ashes.	1981.5353277054278
He coasted them, walking warily.	1376.8650244983396
A porterbottle
stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough.	1946.4207190569145
A sentinel:
isle of dreadful thirst.	1512.141325882671
Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.	1989.2076916956512
Ringsend: wigwams
of brown steersmen and master mariners.	1700.0357297234473
Human shells.	592.3640888758189
He halted.	592.3640888758189
I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s.	878.88701614951
Am I not going there?	1039.4474259248502
Seems not.	592.3640888758189
No-one about.	737.289920052089
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer
sand towards the Pigeonhouse.	1449.0735046972306
_—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_
	1007.6306468897727
_—C’est le pigeon, Joseph._
	724.1084873131331
Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar
MacMahon.	1136.3836233452648
Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris.	712.9852336410593
My father’s a
bird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump
bunny’s face.	1770.734439802102
Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_.	1275.4766526048113
But he must send me _La Vie de
Jésus_ by M.	764.8758852047724
Léo Taxil.	592.3640888758189
Lent it to his friend.	772.944461782247
_—C’est tordant, vous savez.	1196.2994612643795
Moi, je suis socialiste.	1196.3022706333559
Je ne crois pas
en l’existence de Dieu.	1293.4744028585194
Faut pas le dire à mon père._
	1700.0678893036218
_—Il croit?_
	841.8114424048898
_—Mon père, oui._
	1039.4156756356842
He laps.	592.3640888758189
My Latin quarter hat.	841.8084770704346
God, we simply must dress the character.	1109.0831153940092
I want
puce gloves.	991.9789448889109
You were a student, weren’t you?	1095.070056142648
Of what in the other
devil’s name?	990.9074476674975
N., you know: _physiques, chimiques et
naturelles_.	1616.889522283263
Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots
of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen.	1462.3637252610708
Just say in the most natural
tone: when I was in Paris; _boul’ Mich’_, I used to.	805.7466737623453
Yes, used to carry
punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder
somewhere.	2047.672393971274
On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904
the prisoner was seen by two witnesses.	1093.9178648788306
Other fellow did it: other me.	1512.0784412022956
Hat, tie, overcoat, nose.	1196.3022706333559
_Lui, c’est moi_.	1196.2896282679212
You seem to have enjoyed
yourself.	1512.096156702132
Proudly walking.	592.3640888758189
Whom were you trying to walk like?	1234.2909516505456
Forget: a
dispossessed.	946.4336915828404
With mother’s money order, eight shillings, the banging
door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher.	1727.0109176082526
Hunger
toothache.	592.3640888758189
_Encore deux minutes_.	946.4336915828404
Must get.	592.3640888758189
Hired
dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered
walls all brass buttons.	1767.4122125397353
Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back.	1616.8260600451579
Not
hurt?	592.3640888758189
O, that’s all right.	320.3867262099514
Shake hands.	592.3640888758189
See what I meant, see?	784.6746171349943
O,
that’s all right.	320.3867262099514
Shake a shake.	946.4304040663756
O, that’s all only all right.	792.0536179503646
You were going to do wonders, what?	1054.3870399320972
Missionary to Europe after fiery
Columbanus.	592.3640888758189
Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt
from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge!_ Pretending to
speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence,
across the slimy pier at Newhaven.	1299.3945705743638
_Comment?_ Rich booty you brought
back; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte
Rouge_; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
	878.0651861503889
—Mother dying come home father.	1376.8554050927173
The aunt thinks you killed your mother.	946.8138934797443
That’s why she won’t.	912.6239241913721
Then here’s a health to Mulligan’s aunt
	974.6910774319019
And I’ll tell you the reason why.	738.2124403399245
The Hannigan famileye.	592.3640888758189
His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by
the boulders of the south wall.	1803.9142284240622
Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders.	1700.0640161854183
The sun is
there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	1823.8189030357078
Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets.	1767.6422179074345
Moist pith of
farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the
air.	1602.1786272805755
Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife’s lover’s wife, the
kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand.	1541.9661247452066
In
Rodot’s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering
with gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the
_pus_ of _flan bréton_.	1654.5181971544978
Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased
pleasers, curled conquistadores.	1449.0605108983223
Noon slumbers.	592.3640888758189
Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
smeared with printer’s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his
white.	1584.6685662753828
About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets.	1626.5760485164406
_Un demi

She serves

_Il est irlandais.	946.4336915828404

Deux

cheese _hollandais_.	1196.3017344783025
Your postprandial, do you know that word?	710.3795436622858
There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer
fellow, used to call it his postprandial.	1043.193143218366
Well: _slainte!_ Around the
slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges.	1512.1388169614418
His
breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy’s fang
thrusting between his lips.	1675.495318859226
Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes,
conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of
men.	866.2857900245831
To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause.	1871.0535205103247
You’re
your father’s son.	976.9916426917403
I know the voice.	1196.3655927028224
His fustian shirt,

Licentious men.	592.3640888758189
The froeken, _bonne à

_Moi
faire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_.	885.1534237904042
Not this _Monsieur_, I said.	592.3640888758189
Most licentious custom.	946.4336915828404
Bath a most private thing.	1376.8155888887193
I wouldn’t let my
brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing.	1821.7735417874003
Green eyes, I
see you.	570.612822632062
Fang, I feel.	592.3640888758189
Lascivious people.	592.3640888758189
The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear.	1823.8220324988863
Loose
tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner.	1911.3550882392626
Raw
facebones under his peep of day boy’s hat.	1570.0274377946396

Did, faith.	592.3640888758189
Of lost
leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	1616.8260600451579
Disguises, clutched at, gone, not
here.	1197.4746439662513
Spurned lover.	592.3640888758189
I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell
you.	1004.9602949024758
I’ll show you my likeness one day.	1237.5632894815046
I was, faith.	737.2943990675084
Lover, for her
love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under
the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl
them upward in the fog.	1552.5359614479987
Shattered glass and toppling masonry.	872.6029999120732
In gay
Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me.	978.6444280228823
Making his
day’s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the
Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d’Or,
damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.	1556.9182286196879
Loveless, landless,
wifeless.	946.4336915828404
She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in
rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers.	1477.109225416485
Peachy cheeks, a zebra
skirt, frisky as a young thing’s.	1747.6860229562242
Spurned and undespairing.	946.4336915828404
Tell Pat
you saw me, won’t you?	912.6055386933521
I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time.	1109.9319704053905
_Mon
fils_, soldier of France.	784.6746171349943
I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny
are stout roaring blades_.	1017.1574724351003
Know that old lay?	1196.2264068778948
I taught Patrice that.	592.3640888758189
Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow’s castle on the Nore.	784.6735115072871
Goes like
this.	737.2805475510427
_O, O_.	592.3640888758189
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	766.3513046054413
O, O the boys of
	827.458322428374
Weak wasting hand on mine.	1185.300207892989
They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.	841.8069943769832
Remembering thee, O Sion.	592.3640888758189
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	1088.1614478290908
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of
seeds of brightness.	1874.95255102235
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,
am I?	818.3230273320006
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the
quaking soil.	1837.4000843804845
Turn back.	592.3640888758189
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in
new sockets.	1976.3816063424476
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	1341.910189077986
Through the
barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet
are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	2069.370809417286
Blue dusk,
nightfall, deep blue night.	1512.138816961438
In the darkness of the dome they wait,
their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
platters.	2021.644594297332
Who to clear it?	1196.2938424605543
He has the key.	842.9905791809047
I will not sleep there when
this night comes.	1626.551245654425
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind
bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	2026.1427112508118
Call: no answer.	647.1812560548422
He lifted
his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	1708.4574583648914
Take
all, keep all.	1196.3022706333559
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	1237.5516853297443
So in the moon’s
midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing
Elsinore’s tempting flood.	1276.7809604134998
The flood is following me.	1185.2789995483442
I can watch it flow past from here.	1548.0800097496551
He climbed over the sedge
and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
grike.	1898.3331520123868
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	1823.2283017446264
Before him the
gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	1691.5608255189695
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot
called Gautier’s prose.	692.5044133719111
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren
of weasel rats.	1911.3550882392626
Hide gold there.	946.4336915828404
Try it.	592.3640888758189
You have some.	946.415910520381
Sands and
stones.	946.4292464214541
Heavy of the past.	445.4035655918402
Sir Lout’s toys.	841.8114424048898
Mind you don’t get one bang
on the ear.	1285.6268659034947
I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well
boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	2026.5944845420038
I zmellz de bloodz
odz an Iridzman.	1082.0154678135393
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	1946.058775680101
Lord, is he going to attack me?	1452.7440683673249
Respect his liberty.	946.4336915828404
You will not be
master of others or their slave.	1692.1587702667498
I have my stick.	991.9789448889109
Sit tight.	592.3640888758189
From
farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,
two.	1910.98017810929
The two maries.	946.4336915828404
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	1700.0678893036238
I see you.	556.5575301919739
No, the dog.	946.4101604905521
He is running back to them.	1177.953622262569
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	1696.3965124093372
Dane vikings,
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
collar of gold.	1417.8477830582285
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	1976.7098327648475
Then from the starving cagework
city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives,
running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	2034.3725745418553
Famine, plague
and slaughters.	1196.2980565823646
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	1767.7176055283367
I moved
among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
spluttering resin fires.	1266.2910576100562
I spoke to no-one: none to me.	1200.893180016096
Dog of my enemy.	1196.1318087003006
I
just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	1700.070883610277
_Terribilia meditans_.	592.3640888758189
A
primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear.	1823.7919627946046
For that are you
pining, the bark of their applause?	1823.7279658226832
Pretenders: live their lives.	843.0492052997216
The
Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,
York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a
day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion
crowned.	1284.799741084215
All kings’ sons.	737.2943990675084
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	1177.9360296705552
He saved
men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping.	1734.1708125410705
But the courtiers
who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	963.2596688576302
We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	1237.1398995647774
Would you do what
he did?	958.8563060983743
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	1616.7801447311558
_Natürlich_, put there for
you.	818.5276894618536
The man that was drowned nine days ago
off Maiden’s rock.	1124.4616198764659
They are waiting for him now.	1056.9500096363524
The truth, spit it
out.	1001.3285365719655
I would want to.	666.1753269356359
I would try.	946.4292464214541
I am not a strong swimmer.	1512.000111965519
Water
cold soft.	946.4336915828404
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	980.756785090239
Can’t
see! Who’s behind me?	752.100457674444
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing
quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,
shellcocoacoloured?	1506.7644244890646
If I had land under my feet.	1188.4037465827532
I want his life still
to be his, mine to be mine.	1632.7592039192223
A drowning man.	946.4336915828404
His human eyes scream to me
out of horror of his death.	1513.8892462452573
With him together down...	1196.3022706333559
I could not
save her.	1185.2239498578763
Waters: bitter death: lost.	1196.3022706333559
A woman and a man.	724.0150542894766
I see her skirties.	1196.257009819142
Pinned up, I bet.	592.3640888758189
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
all sides.	1744.716520529543
Looking for something lost in a past life.	1283.2847170533444
Suddenly he made
off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
lowskimming gull.	1814.048725311959
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	1767.681016537955
He
turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	1823.855445171015
On a
field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	1767.7613020413205
At the lacefringe of
the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	1945.6256683121048
His snout
lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	1823.6781463375676
They serpented
towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,
breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	2113.2046399813503
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	1676.4454622045544
The dog yelped
running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	1986.1837119730808
Unheeded he kept by them
as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting
from his jaws.	2054.8067900620786
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped
off at a calf’s gallop.	1800.8038860589804
The carcass lay on his path.	1177.8932936934373
He stopped,
sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,
sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.	1974.7348958251175
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	1130.9441408187035
Ah,
poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.	1106.4249882434176
—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
	1196.132117705613
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	2062.476423872967
He
slunk back in a curve.	1159.1345374874386
Doesn’t see me.	676.4498623854969
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
quick short at an unsmelt rock.	2003.0050426592518
The simple pleasures of the poor.	1196.7856814232234
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	1334.6332301979412
He rooted in the sand,
dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	1814.883183963999
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	1405.7649409069459
Open hallway.	592.3640888758189
Street of harlots.	737.2909362695849
Haroun al Raschid.	592.3640888758189
I am almosting it.	1196.3022706333559
That
man led me, spoke.	1376.861144421135
The melon he had he held against
my face.	1496.6578270431999
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	946.4336915828404
That was the rule, said.	1376.6451373695359
Red carpet spread.	737.2943990675084
You will see who.	1196.2727716458212
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	1196.3001636060046
His blued feet
out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
strangling his unshaven neck.	2084.065624911127
With woman steps she followed: the
ruffian and his strolling mort.	1870.9007641063815
Spoils slung at her back.	1185.1905381144677
Loose sand
and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	1700.0589063544317
About her windraw face hair
trailed.	1512.138816961438
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	1293.4683276928945
When
night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an
archway where dogs have mired.	2083.637195992073
Her fancyman is treating two Royal
Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.	735.3811231526863
Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum
lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her
rancid rags.	1414.222335833823
Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	1700.0498242176852
White thy fambles, red thy gan
	917.6839735979954
And thy quarrons dainty is.	878.3780628965003
Couch a hogshead with me then.	1334.6289773780047
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	1512.1406665234754
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	1196.3022706333559
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	1196.2482693118466
Call away let him: _thy quarrons
dainty is_.	1700.0110125567653
Language no whit worse than his.	1512.110407677918
Monkwords, marybeads
jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their
pockets.	1945.9321509095714
Passing now.	592.3640888758189
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	885.1462968193742
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	946.4336915828404
I
am not.	946.4114650810416
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s
flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	1376.8707436950658
She trudges,
schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	1700.070883610277
A tide westering,
moondrawn, in her wake.	1616.6970882426258
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not
mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	1911.3550882392626
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	769.4185053263602
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	1871.0619600745558
Bridebed,
childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	1512.111227345969
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	878.3805381550931
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	1275.9646799470556
My tablets.	592.3640888758189
Mouth to her kiss.	991.8998910576252
Must be two of em.	1376.8503864006284
Glue em well.	946.4336915828404
Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	805.4755551207721
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	1747.3849968693048
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
wayawayawayawayaway.	2003.0497127767173
The banknotes, blast them.	1196.3022706333559
Old Deasy’s
letter.	633.0210592346853
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	1451.6829610287252
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
scribbled words.	1707.1018720821135
That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library
counter.	1263.3108847427998
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	1691.9760086697434
Why not endless till
the farthest star?	1616.7715732290355
Me sits there
with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth
stars.	2065.4612411919097
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it
back.	1673.7662653101142
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	1626.4355302385536
Who watches me here?	899.5892575007476
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	1700.0648950022403
Signs on a white
field.	1376.5090421001903
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	1616.778050030866
The good bishop of
Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space
with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	1654.5576472988014
Hold hard.	592.3640888758189
Coloured on a
flat: yes, that’s right.	935.5153051783774
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,
flat I see, east, back.	1262.7589453437074
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in
stereoscope.	1106.4301849033661
Click does the trick.	699.0550718138056
You find my words dark.	1376.853384062898
Darkness is
in our souls do you not think?	1318.7075620888281
Our souls, shamewounded by our
sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
more.	1967.6435544572328
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	1767.7346020725302
Now where the blue
hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	1344.9075724251716
Into the ineluctable modality
of the ineluctable visuality.	1090.539508600091
She, she, she.	946.4292464214541
What she?	592.3640888758189
The virgin at
Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet
books you were going to write.	877.02268272961
Keen glance you gave her.	1376.8349931155383
Wrist through
the braided jesse of her sunshade.	1699.5985793351133
She lives in Leeson park with a
grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	1461.9981896326995
Talk that to someone else,
Stevie: a pickmeup.	1003.5145169034193
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders
and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	1557.0688859562954
Talk about apple
dumplings, _piuttosto_.	1376.8650244983396
Where are your wits?	1196.2980565823646
Touch me.	592.3640888758189
Soft eyes.	592.3640888758189
Soft soft soft hand.	1196.2938425462191
I am lonely here.	1196.3022706333559
O, touch me
soon, now.	1376.8582747755074
What is that word known to all men?	961.3122170976343
I am quiet here alone.	1376.8650244983396
Sad too.	592.3640888758189
Touch, touch me.	737.2840105113547
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the
scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his
eyes.	1733.7615617098675
That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap,
sabbath sleep.	1081.9746389184882
_Et vidit Deus.	592.3640888758189
Et erant valde bona_.	1196.3022706333559
Alo! _Bonjour_.	592.3640888758189
Welcome as the flowers in May.	946.2559570589335
Under its leaf he watched through
peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	1871.0763406692977
I am caught in this burning
scene.	1616.7723142573427
Pan’s hour, the faunal noon.	1334.6394984235985
Among gumheavy serpentplants,
milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	1945.9005844434112
Pain is
far.	946.4248011905848
And no more turn aside and brood.	716.0717362356347
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs,
_nebeneinander_.	1795.6066787943294
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
another’s foot had nested warm.	1976.403405702965
_Tiens, quel petit pied!_
Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its
name.	1012.5517045557422
His arm: Cranly’s arm.	624.6723327035223
He now will leave me.	1376.861144421135
And the blame?	946.4336915828404
As I am.	592.3640888758189
All or not at all.	510.9983518481472
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	1634.9469667579747
My ashplant will float
away.	1376.8650244983396
I shall wait.	946.4336915828404
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
low rocks, swirling, passing.	1946.02346424298
Better get this job over quick.	1512.138816961438
Listen: a
fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	1700.070883610277
Vehement breath of
waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	1767.7529988626434
And, spent, its speech
ceases.	1376.8650244983396
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower
unfurling.	1767.7688841065128
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	2043.8721243369175
Day by day: night by night:
lifted, flooded and let fall.	1575.759407318683
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
they sigh.	1767.692211278966
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
patiens ingemiscit_.	1994.4649241689506
To no end gathered; vainly then released,
forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	1479.5255810736608
Weary too in sight of
lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws
a toil of waters.	1967.66449880181
Five fathoms out there.	991.9544829949613
Full fathom five thy father lies.	1512.141325882671
At one, he
said.	378.97830369861305
Found drowned.	592.3640888758189
High water at Dublin bar.	592.3640888758189
Driving before it a
loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	1946.0712809874246
A corpse
rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise
landward.	1636.4741547467177
There he is.	409.57939890750083
Hook it quick.	946.4336915828404
Sunk though he be beneath
the watery floor.	1064.4392115832459
We have him.	946.3892368418818
Easy now.	592.3640888758189
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	1616.8260600451579
A quiver of minnows, fat of a
spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	2046.9395148313067
God
becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
mountain.	1686.8478688958573
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
urinous offal from all dead.	1660.6881574580277
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
the sun.	1717.0641326589948
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	1512.138816961438
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
known to man.	1548.0956431865484
Old Father Ocean.	592.3640888758189
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	737.2913871483535
Just you give it a fair trial.	1068.6541721250098
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	1196.3022706333559
I thirst.	592.3640888758189
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	1512.1317147529485
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	1288.5075648010545
My cockle hat and staff and
hismy sandal shoon.	1767.7320889619762
To evening lands.	737.2943990675084
Evening will find itself.	991.9798548669571
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
still.	1945.7573717988873
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	1496.629399494088
All days make
their end.	1376.861144421135
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	1328.1377742578343
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	1795.62023789127
Lawn
Tennyson, gentleman poet.	841.8055116861434
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	1063.9403246758527
My teeth are very
bad.	1376.861144421135
Why, I wonder.	592.3640888758189
That one is going too.	1376.865476069421
Ought I go to
a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	1048.2093106848552
That one.	592.3640888758189
Toothless Kinch,
the superman.	841.8114424048898
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	1275.2387041412853
My handkerchief.	592.3640888758189
He threw it.	946.4203558902273
I remember.	592.3640888758189
Did I not take it up?	761.0178267583957
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	1452.653935575968
No, I didn’t.	633.0204099348418
Better buy one.	737.2918380794588
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
carefully.	2002.806309297904
For the rest let look who will.	1616.859363318103
Perhaps there is someone.	1196.3537013278772
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	1767.7013285558733
Moving through the
air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	1738.319086641293
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	1244.9140648729494
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes.	2066.608868060271
Most of all he
liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
faintly scented urine.	2021.8014063357805
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	1718.9472689369693
Gelid light and air were in the
kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	1612.339448827936
Made him
feel a bit peckish.	1512.1405172188365
The coals were reddening.	1196.3022706333559
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	1304.7809421558388
She didn’t like
her plate full.	1189.392719183199
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	1487.4088071328483
It sat there, dull and squat,
its spout stuck out.	1823.8586843416529
Cup of tea soon.	1196.27075141127
Mouth dry.	592.3640888758189
The cat walked
stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	1049.2173903044031
—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	651.6824622030726
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
table, mewing.	1342.8988595710166
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	1616.8195510492678
Scratch
my head.	946.407019572209
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	1512.13881696144
Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
tail, the green flashing eyes.	1813.487247952695
He bent down to her, his hands on his
knees.	1065.7808444319332
—Milk for the pussens, he said.	795.9265679917826
They call them stupid.	1196.2738683575353
They understand what we say better than we
understand them.	1823.8349923164192
She understands all she wants to.	1334.6121050399615
Vindictive too.	592.3640888758189
Her nature.	592.3640888758189
Curious mice never squeal.	1196.3022706333559
Seem to like it.	699.044683436084
Wonder
what I look like to her.	786.9794417993832
Height of a tower?	991.1385685645454
No, she can jump me.	1376.853384062898
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	1432.847633804788
Afraid of the
chookchooks.	1195.3654486092223
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	1823.5886423281472
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	1376.8105690150626
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	1627.0625349542763
He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	1821.7505483726763
Then he went to
the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,
poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	1399.640434116558
—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	1334.6438322283013
Wonder is it true if you clip them they
can’t mouse after.	1671.3790678059422
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	981.5374666854866
Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	1077.8689947242192
He listened to her licking lap.	1512.044274219946
Ham and eggs, no.	1196.2938424605543
Thursday: not a good day either for
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.	1406.7850958531367
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	1452.715854799377
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.	795.3122608863554
While the kettle is boiling.	1020.3400080397097
Why are their tongues so
rough?	1512.1317148251362
To lap better, all porous holes.	1512.138816961438
He glanced
round him.	899.5607363585602
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door.	1652.9400532745774
She might like something tasty.	1376.853384062898
Thin bread and butter
she likes in the morning.	906.1280295775293
Still perhaps: once in a way.	617.8582323077268
He said softly in the bare hall:
	1305.6750496495354
—I’m going round the corner.	800.3822467459337
And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
	1290.382525972361
—You don’t want anything for breakfast?	1021.8713078821703
A sleepy soft grunt answered:
	1376.8650244983396
She didn’t want anything.	895.8439869144494
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	1898.1041400453782
Must get those settled really.	1376.853384062898
All the way from Gibraltar.	784.7125856389041
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	619.1562044187231
Wonder what her father gave for
it.	1164.8516966394811
Old style.	592.3640888758189
Ah yes! of course.	558.9617510244689
Bought it at the governor’s auction.	1156.9142772810123
Got a short knock.	822.5481313436928
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	1089.3011980309786
Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
At
Plevna that was.	527.290393164424
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.	942.4758615691353
Still
he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	1632.8638767828263
Now that was
farseeing.	1196.3876451823944
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	1839.3760712375138
Stamps: stickyback
pictures.	946.4336915828404
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	1557.7791236566381
Course they do.	593.5061754079976
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s
high grade ha.	1151.4608720221227
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	1068.6952617536433
White
slip of paper.	641.2201504020969
Quite safe.	592.3640888758189
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	1533.8065505460083
Not there.	592.3640888758189
In the trousers I left off.	748.7510033694363
Must get it.	647.1914378931414
Potato I have.	592.3640888758189
Creaky
wardrobe.	592.3640888758189
No use disturbing her.	1196.3022706333559
She turned over sleepily that time.	1250.4076942877798
He
pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf
dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	2039.0393781196394
Looked shut.	592.3640888758189
All right
till I come back anyhow.	885.1544508694353
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
seventyfive.	1836.6282147745185
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.	1109.941348531105
Be a
warm day I fancy.	748.743969494627
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	1548.0812262561244
Black
conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	1222.4638854921138
But I couldn’t go in
that light suit.	1511.965318213621
Make a picnic of it.	736.9834452086626
His eyelids sank quietly often as
he walked in happy warmth.	1474.3677879523623
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our
daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	2066.59995600127
Makes you feel young.	1196.2905865351215
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn.	1824.2321185451694
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	1747.9072895911806
Walk along a
strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker
too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	1680.1833643521038
Wander through awned streets.	1196.3022706333559
Turbaned faces going by.	1196.2938424605543
Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
a coiled pipe.	1557.071628707376
Cries of sellers in the streets.	1512.6681526322366
Drink water scented
with fennel, sherbet.	1512.1352658891194
Dander along all day.	843.0224780073474
Might meet a robber or two.	1197.4444430000676
Well, meet him.	647.1842956733051
Getting on to sundown.	1196.3317571162002
The shadows of the mosques among
the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	1774.9529323812474
A shiver of the trees,
signal, the evening wind.	1625.9740803444336
I pass on.	946.4292464214541
Fading gold sky.	946.4336915828404
A mother watches
me from her doorway.	1616.7444707610496
She calls her children home in their dark
language.	1767.583393017252
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	1376.8650244983396
Night sky, moon, violet,
colour of Molly’s new garters.	1109.9538602900575
A girl playing one of
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	1040.3082985511326
I pass.	592.3640888758189
Probably not a bit like it really.	1167.233672659589
Kind of stuff you read: in the track
of the sun.	843.3205606727602
Sunburst on the titlepage.	1195.8745420096973
He smiled, pleasing himself.	1196.3022706333559
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_
leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway
behind the bank of Ireland.	1091.3970820947004
He prolonged his pleased smile.	1376.8650244983396
Ikey touch
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	786.6623675320657
He approached Larry O’Rourke’s.	592.3640888758189
From the cellar grating floated up the
flabby gush of porter.	1647.4068208886533
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	1946.083085365039
Good house, however: just the
end of the city traffic.	915.9070390829622
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n.	913.8179232465903
as
position.	2416.131317459335
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular
from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	1344.9014565202801
Baldhead over the blind.	1195.996059194803
Cute old codger.	946.4336915828404
No use canvassing him for an
ad.	1048.8358936972238
Still he knows his own business best.	1234.2241452135706
There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	1769.953753986911
Simon Dedalus takes him
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	1376.7136687895231
Do you know what I’m going to
tell you?	479.93142070994196
What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?	592.3640888758189
Do you know what?	654.6066590046829
The Russians,
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.	1462.3360995223532
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	1280.950497560538
Sad thing about poor
Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.	706.1565772035038
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
doorway:
	1244.1338355027901
—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.	592.3640888758189
—Good day to you.	773.2384756198055
—Lovely weather, sir.	946.4336915828404
—’Tis all that.	593.467985209623
Where do they get the money?	974.015628944885
Coming up redheaded curates from the
county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	1211.8182551711368
Then, lo and
behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	1017.1806983118043
Then think
of the competition.	946.4061829693976
General thirst.	592.3640888758189
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
without passing a pub.	1109.9380513178685
Save it they can’t.	737.8423468281967
Off the drunks perhaps.	1196.2980565823646
Put
down three and carry five.	1512.1235704392582
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs
and drabs.	1132.37732162407
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	1376.861144421135
Doing a double shuffle with
the town travellers.	1699.360052724673
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the
job, see?	1600.2491649204342
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	1687.2024907927619
Say ten barrels
of stuff.	1376.8417436469852
O more.	592.3640888758189
He passed Saint
Joseph’s National school.	592.3640888758189
Brats’ clamour.	592.3640888758189
Windows open.	592.3640888758189
Fresh air helps
memory.	1196.3022706333559
Or a lilt.	946.4336915828404
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee
doubleyou.	1512.138816961438
Boys are they?	528.9628741836711
At
their joggerfry.	946.4336915828404
Slieve Bloom.	592.3640888758189
He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white.	1417.776908629568
Fifteen multiplied by.	946.4248011905848
The figures whitened
in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	1652.5435052717044
The shiny links,
packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.	2126.067639181623
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	1585.343560152865
He
stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	1049.530069810879
Would she buy it too,
calling the items from a slip in her hand?	1540.078784596469
Chapped: washingsoda.	592.3640888758189
And a
pound and a half of Denny’s sausages.	724.8533552544307
His eyes rested on her vigorous
hips.	1616.6738565056096
Woods his name is.	548.5246968405404
Wonder what he does.	699.0314424031351
Wife is oldish.	946.4336915828404
New
blood.	592.3640888758189
No followers allowed.	946.4336915828404
Strong pair of arms.	991.9028503220119
Whacking a carpet on
the clothesline.	1511.778359787624
She does whack it, by George.	946.4336915828393
The way her crooked
skirt swings at each whack.	1767.7690380036724
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	1616.5774466994303
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	1257.5217037859688
Can become ideal winter
sanatorium.	1376.8650244983396
Moses Montefiore.	592.3640888758189
I thought he was.	471.58853982191744
Farmhouse, wall round
it, blurred cattle cropping.	1452.7208450043024
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a
palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled
switches in their hands.	1978.3507296829707
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his
senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	1982.2384215619354
The crooked skirt
swinging, whack by whack by whack.	1165.932272185577
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
sausages and made a red grimace.	1794.3284042390776
—Now, my miss, he said.	637.6536838614757
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	1871.065504959731
—Thank you, my miss.	991.9579782432066
And one shilling threepence change.	1376.8650244983396
For you,
please?	593.5117508033923
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	841.8114424048898
To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams.	2002.9755956567174
Pleasant to see first thing in the
morning.	729.9892207916918
Hurry up, damn it.	843.0402966514259
Make hay while the sun shines.	1250.419291313447
She stood
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	1405.5708272370096
He
sighed down his nose: they never understand.	1699.987104320787
Sodachapped hands.	592.3640888758189
Crusted
toenails too.	946.4336915828404
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	1700.0678893036218
The
sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	1632.79653485985
For
another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane.	1275.2343864489014
They like
them sizeable.	1196.2980565823646
Prime sausage.	592.3640888758189
O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the
wood.	798.5307234165856
—Threepence, please.	592.3640888758189
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	1412.091442801826
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them
on the rubber prickles.	1753.0956351966797
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
disc by disc, into the till.	1976.2653329026064
—Thank you, sir.	507.19202448485635
Another time.	592.3640888758189
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	1767.7550460714317
He withdrew his gaze
after an instant.	1234.310657814728
No: better not: another time.	1096.0881123680729
—Good morning, he said, moving away.	1512.6611480554227
—Good morning, sir.	737.2918380794588
No sign.	592.3640888758189
What matter?	592.3640888758189
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	1003.524259793509
Agendath Netaim:
planters’ company.	841.8114424048898
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	1406.9649315339623
Excellent for shade, fuel
and construction.	1512.138816961438
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	1082.0132898299269
Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation.	1177.9921723767718
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	1767.077359099992
Your
name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	1455.0844393244358
Can pay ten
down and the balance in yearly instalments.	1569.4976185493485
Bleibtreustrasse 34,
Berlin, W.	592.3640888758189
Nothing doing.	592.3640888758189
Still an idea behind it.	1020.3407568697849
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	1512.941859086042
Silverpowdered
olivetrees.	592.3640888758189
Olives are packed in
jars, eh?	1512.1352658891194
I have a few left from Andrews.	919.2817177590385
Molly spitting them out.	843.0453643489165
Knows the taste of them now.	1334.590748139603
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	1616.8162964949868
Citrons too.	592.3640888758189
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade.	632.5620920909272
And
Mastiansky with the old cither.	916.8170774753792
Pleasant evenings we had then.	1376.8259659211337
Molly in
Citron’s basketchair.	784.6746171349943
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,
lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	1779.8889705727001
Like that, heavy, sweet,
wild perfume.	1512.138816961438
Always the same, year after year.	1177.9479148318958
They fetched high
prices too, Moisel told me.	783.6126773131012
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant
old times.	861.8323708454075
Must be without a flaw, he said.	932.9507152614578
Coming all that way: Spain,
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	692.4854731085668
Crates lined up on the quayside
at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them
barefoot in soiled dungarees.	1520.0600733589702
There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	1041.397199545999
How do
you?	647.464288475488
Doesn’t see.	593.5079703896076
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	1469.8753083715596
His back
is like that Norwegian captain’s.	1003.5158825838569
Wonder if I’ll meet him today.	972.1965718607311
Watering cart.	592.3640888758189
To provoke the rain.	899.5639055996239
On earth as it is in heaven.	1010.6875591725376
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	1027.1652228286907
No, not like that.	363.1134012491472
A barren land, bare waste.	1376.8650244983396
Vulcanic lake, the dead
sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	1200.2095967929629
No wind could lift
those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	1871.0774890473367
Brimstone they called
it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	1067.516158959471
All
dead names.	946.4336915828404
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	1569.6543398326696
Old now.	592.3640888758189
It bore
the oldest, the first race.	1616.7090166215894
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s,
clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	1313.7456628361174
The oldest people.	946.4336915828404
Wandered far
away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,
being born everywhere.	1801.2133132576905
It lay there now.	803.3830381960142
Now it could bear no more.	944.891375282387
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	941.93870373021
Grey horror seared his flesh.	1185.2789995483442
Folding the page into his pocket he
turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	1125.8009748300599
Cold oils slid along his
veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	1834.2212744572973
Well, I
am here now.	712.3338764610813
Yes, I am here now.	712.3338764610813
Morning mouth bad images.	1196.3022706333559
Got up wrong
side of the bed.	477.7569521438385
Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises.	885.1516420694318
On the
hands down.	676.4946992965891
Blotchy brown brick houses.	1196.3022706333559
Number eighty still unlet.	1196.3022706333559
Why
is that?	397.770905500622
Valuation is only twentyeight.	1196.3033680726708
Towers, Battersby, North,
MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	1106.4284526924087
Plasters on a sore
eye.	1376.538057701521
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling
butter.	1782.2306442147453
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	1512.113958114298
Yes, yes.	592.3640888758189
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath.	1557.060476263528
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	1496.1136234574462
He stooped and gathered
them.	1376.8572642759873
Mrs Marion Bloom.	592.3640888758189
His quickened heart slowed at once.	1087.324050992623
Bold hand.	592.3640888758189
Mrs Marion.	592.3640888758189
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	1768.1738192572361
—Who are the letters for?	1376.775691525989
He looked at them.	699.0434297018422
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	1223.706780947285
And
a letter for you.	704.6233762681723
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of
her knees.	1845.160186935515
—Do you want the blind up?	1334.6420275430173
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1876.697514780676
—That do?	592.3640888758189
he asked, turning.	930.6390003985123
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	1767.6111700954161
—She got the things, she said.	907.3853795310017
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
slowly with a snug sigh.	1981.9259352015445
—Hurry up with that tea, she said.	886.7422569799261
I’m parched.	946.4336915828404
—The kettle is boiling, he said.	702.7114047039893
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	1355.1577062144727
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
	1304.737090114469
—Scald the teapot.	946.415910520381
He scalded
and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting
the kettle then to let the water flow in.	2095.159512204388
Having set it to draw he took
off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the
lump of butter slide and melt.	1974.2169343247383
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat
mewed hungrily against him.	1686.8036153423463
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.	1557.3492091525588
Say
they won’t eat pork.	1177.953527638156
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall
to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	1847.791567843993
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	1870.6303671553342
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	1795.5725983900525
Thanks:
new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s
seaside girls.	692.6401786041038
The tea was drawn.	1196.2980565823661
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,
smiling.	1106.347742439371
Silly Milly’s birthday gift.	1039.4127464487399
Only five she was then.	1376.7731294067517
No, wait:
four.	946.4336915828404
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	1548.0445598068811
He smiled, pouring.	946.4336915828404
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	826.0620363777409
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	1700.0619006452653
I’d rather have you without a farthing
	1548.0557227770712
Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	1196.1942313673705
Poor old professor Goodwin.	592.3640888758189
Dreadful old case.	946.4336915828404
Still he was a courteous
old chap.	1068.6449229317323
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	882.2815034734055
And
the little mirror in his silk hat.	1299.483574428953
The night Milly brought it into the
parlour.	850.5529397020855
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we
laughed.	735.3805100713929
Sex breaking out even then.	1376.861144421135
Pert little piece she was.	909.6990487906703
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray.	1901.2864032448492
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	853.3670808778751
Everything on it?	489.3537611132002
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	1700.053696811204
He carried it
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	1748.203177973487
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it
on the chair by the bedhead.	1399.7933912941935
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
the pillow.	1812.4196601497601
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large
soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.	2125.994386693743
The
warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance
of the tea she poured.	1934.757929090925
In the
act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	1578.3292634841046
—Who was the letter from?	1185.0569606230292
he asked.	168.4727106542555
Bold hand.	592.3640888758189
—O, Boylan, she said.	391.32163216066795
—What are you singing?	1196.3207046429382
—_Là ci darem_ with J.	784.6746171349943
Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.	692.5453127955834
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	1376.8572642759873
Rather stale smell that incense leaves
next day.	1548.0820264136516
Like foul flowerwater.	946.4336915828404
—Would you like the window open a little?	1342.225310156011
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
	1117.2040272129789
—What time is the funeral?	665.4081025906544
—Eleven, I think, he answered.	894.7819602464576
I didn’t see the paper.	727.1199362463877
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
drawers from the bed.	1485.9385489979957
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	1911.3466951512382
—No: that book.	946.4114650810416
Other stocking.	592.3640888758189
—It must have fell down, she said.	842.5707460622283
He felt here and there.	770.3885136599279
Wonder if she pronounces
that right: _voglio_.	1616.805153593463
Not in the bed.	450.08348526962203
Must have slid down.	1196.3022706333559
He stooped
and lifted the valance.	1512.1104081110607
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
the orangekeyed chamberpot.	1870.4672528126596
—Show here, she said.	461.12799169018047
I put a mark in it.	1011.5167980933697
There’s a word I wanted to
ask you.	1017.9320518147093
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	1932.4741201494282
—Met him what?	946.4259588536014
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—Here, she said.	340.8125412465234
What does that mean?	745.9327384693531
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	1767.7225532637433
Who’s he when he’s at home?	928.8257612581951
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	822.987346869368
It’s Greek: from the Greek.	592.3640888758189
That
means the transmigration of souls.	1250.4333584001372
—O, rocks! she said.	556.1090447575491
Tell us in plain words.	1376.8561256814232
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	1699.9975695566764
The same young eyes.	1196.2896284392518
The first night after the charades.	1334.491458405921
Dolphin’s Barn.	592.3640888758189
He turned over the
smudged pages.	1334.4275146770392
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	592.3640888758189
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	841.8114424048898
Must be Ruby pride of the on the
floor naked.	930.6330184380472
Sheet kindly lent.	946.4336915828404
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung
his victim from him with an oath_.	1567.5456310080538
Cruelty behind it all.	991.9272044631394
Doped
animals.	592.3640888758189
Trapeze at Hengler’s.	592.3640888758189
Had to look the other way.	1130.459069083519
Mob gaping.	592.3640888758189
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides.	1513.0562279572193
Families of them.	416.2189502545541
Bone them
young so they metamspychosis.	1512.1158083046998
That we live after death.	971.1662723603179
Our souls.	592.3640888758189
That
a man’s soul after he dies.	1286.729051665365
—Did you finish it?	1196.30524796855
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—Yes, she said.	340.8125412465234
There’s nothing smutty in it.	1011.5381792762505
Is she in love with the
first fellow all the time?	841.4162365926866
—Never read it.	946.4203558902273
Do you want another?	1196.3279792543933
Get another of Paul de Kock’s.	592.3640888758189
Nice name he has.	991.8954453170192
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	1871.0420811061094
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to
Kearney, my guarantor.	1063.0568172480562
Reincarnation: that’s the word.	465.8538804330615
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
after death, that we lived before.	1886.6106234377744
They call it reincarnation.	1196.2442259182862
That we
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
planet.	1639.7287086272709
They say we have forgotten it.	1512.0694975637648
Some say they remember their
past lives.	1616.8065324744841
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	1767.752278218607
Better
remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	1218.1410605884323
An example would be better.	1096.0771338910313
An
example?	592.3640888758189
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	533.1786605259015
Given away with the Easter number
of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	885.1480784571451
Tea before you
put milk in.	1512.088983373834
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	1299.430988090299
Three and six
I gave for the frame.	1003.2996001584655
Naked
nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	1293.7161861427312
—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	990.5207128274977
They
used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
instance.	1528.7004553981824
What they called nymphs, for example.	1250.4105339307407
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	1547.979689554491
She gazed straight before her,
inhaling through her arched nostrils.	1823.8477352838247
—There’s a smell of burn, she said.	961.0446590796982
Did you leave anything on the fire?	1131.890812879122
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.	1376.844485015134
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs.	2047.8478192940127
Pungent smoke
shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	1334.5778294218662
By prodding a prong of
the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its
back.	2021.5126777801484
Only a little burnt.	1196.1168219163676
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and
let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	1661.1744159507489
Cup of tea now.	1196.27075141127
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	1198.042428738161
He
shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	1476.8516681717313
Then he put a
forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
meat.	1905.4238351530435
Done to a turn.	1195.9457959937508
A mouthful of tea.	991.9518991285098
Then he cut away dies of
bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	1035.6074902167447
What was that
about some young student and a picnic?	1823.4785934407419
He creased out the letter at his
side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in
the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	1569.4614689339244
Dearest Papli
	592.3640888758189
Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	1626.2094953019448
It suits me
splendid.	1196.3022706333559
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	1448.9912184602608
I got
mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing.	1871.0661295346476
They are lovely.	946.4292464214541
I am
getting on swimming in the photo business now.	1692.554001142244
Will send when developed.	1196.3022706333559
We did great biz yesterday.	1376.861144421135
Fair
day and all the beef to the heels were in.	840.5569827296224
We are going to lough Owel
on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	1092.1795150459577
Give my love to
mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	1946.0371930661925
I hear them at the piano
downstairs.	1068.5252725108055
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	682.1077744354435
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the
pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls.	1247.2260677931913
Tell
him silly Milly sends my best respects.	1003.5224923028716
I must now close with fondest
love
	1616.8228055439354
Your fond daughter
	946.4336915828404
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	1512.1281636973065
Fifteen yesterday.	592.3640888758189
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	1086.7655874533705
Her first
birthday away from home.	1512.121258731741
Remember the summer morning she
was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	1113.9816753347704
Jolly
old woman.	647.166748483749
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	960.3298410032008
She knew
from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live.	1112.548931109671
Well, God is good, sir.	894.7770001547544
She knew at once.	729.4439486539347
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	1093.9599083159799
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	1699.8553222334276
Excuse bad writing.	946.4292464214541
Piano downstairs.	592.3640888758189
Coming out of her shell.	800.5003681899674
Row with her in the
XL Café about the bracelet.	799.6538222885717
Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.	1767.7585343767928
Twelve and six a week.	1185.2697979923719
Not much.	592.3640888758189
Still, she
might do worse.	1376.8592853082118
Music hall stage.	946.4336915828404
Young student.	592.3640888758189
Then he read the letter again: twice.	1068.636075828095
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	1548.0233615964137
But if not?	593.4997817085673
No, nothing has
happened.	1196.3022706333559
Of course it might.	1196.3200035389843
Wait in any case till it does.	1080.4986753771755
A wild
piece of goods.	1376.820480435573
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	1031.540121693682
Ripening now.	592.3640888758189
Vain: very.	592.3640888758189
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	1626.3683076397747
Day I caught
her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	1192.902670716512
Anemic a
little.	737.137647152176
Was given milk too long.	1376.8505145328627
On the _Erin’s King_ that day round
the Kish.	784.6627420709592
Damned old tub pitching about.	1376.8650244983396
Not a bit funky.	1196.3284762695487
Her pale blue
scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	1241.8671212104794
All dimpled cheeks and curls,
	1376.8533842206512
Your head it simply swirls.	719.6978809299593
Seaside girls.	592.3640888758189
Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets,
jarvey off for the day, singing.	1411.6403830700008
Friend of the family.	821.8966969849306
Swurls, he says.	528.9479681914404
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	1512.1352658891174
Those girls, those girls,
	991.9911441733195
Those lovely seaside girls.	528.0465860455535
Milly too.	592.3640888758189
Far away now past.	1196.2980565823646
Mrs Marion.	592.3640888758189
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
braiding.	1737.930370790208
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	1767.7301330758642
Will
happen, yes.	946.4336915828404
Useless: can’t move.	1196.2474379072892
Girl’s sweet light lips.	1376.8650244983396
Will happen too.	946.4336915828404
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	1548.0725396322805
Useless to
move now.	1196.281199670174
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	1196.3022706333559
Full gluey woman’s lips.	1185.1953716954324
Better where she is down there: away.	1234.3349158696988
Occupy her.	592.3640888758189
Wanted a dog to pass
the time.	796.9285488403784
Might take a trip down there.	1130.4011882814445
August bank holiday, only two
and six return.	1427.166023680465
Six weeks off, however.	1196.3022706333559
Might work a press pass.	1376.8631653649861
Or
through M’Coy.	592.3640888758189
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door.	1525.255989924997
She looked back at him, mewing.	1512.08286702944
Wants to go out.	843.098565449151
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	1700.024533034602
Let her
wait.	946.4292464214541
Has the fidgets.	946.4248011905848
Thunder in the air.	314.29474083712154
Was washing at her
ear with her back to the fire too.	1578.0409134871156
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	1870.721753708125
He stood
up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	1304.5301800262628
The cat mewed to him.	870.1219350009679
—Miaow! he said in answer.	770.6693769328051
Wait till I’m ready.	784.6724058811368
Heaviness: hot day coming.	1196.3022706333559
A paper.	592.3640888758189
He liked to read at stool.	1512.0918738353946
Hope no ape comes knocking just as
I’m.	1106.4301849033661
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	1376.81151968048
He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	1031.2957030634357
The cat went up in
soft bounds.	1616.8994225405972
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	1121.9901811375596
Listening, he heard her voice:
	1020.276741834549
—Come, come, pussy.	946.4336915828404
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
towards the next garden.	1708.667916472229
No sound.	592.3640888758189
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	1512.1779182461214
The maid was in the garden.	831.4320264075604
Fine morning.	592.3640888758189
Make a summerhouse here.	1196.3022706333559
Scarlet runners.	592.3640888758189
Virginia creepers.	592.3640888758189
Want to
manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	1557.3560298853988
A coat of liver of sulphur.	1512.1413258826692
All soil like that without dung.	1512.224745341028
Household slops.	592.3640888758189
Loam, what is this
that is?	743.7913650329314
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
dressing.	1625.5503148426067
Mulch of dung.	946.4348492096655
Best thing to clean ladies’ kid
gloves.	1616.813889423153
Dirty cleans.	592.3640888758189
Ashes too.	592.3640888758189
Reclaim the whole place.	899.5107953799476
Grow peas in
that corner there.	1511.9772896970926
Always have fresh greens then.	1376.8650244983396
Still
gardens have their drawbacks.	1376.8495037818602
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	835.3424342748427
He walked on.	647.1698887573939
Must have put it back on the
peg.	1147.20256175342
Or hanging up on the floor.	471.04404662963736
Funny I don’t remember that.	1056.1472705250083
Hallstand
too full.	946.4348492096655
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	1196.3022706333559
Picking up the letters.	698.9546245718979
Drago’s shopbell ringing.	1196.3022706333559
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	1009.7673000653812
Brown
brillantined hair over his collar.	1512.0842063841833
Just had a wash and brushup.	1334.4861302380052
Wonder
have I time for a bath this morning.	848.5228972363768
Tara street.	592.3640888758189
Chap in the paybox
there got away James Stephens, they say.	901.4464894133924
O’Brien.	592.3640888758189
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	660.8604001077249
Agendath what is it?	283.24921913491715
Now, my miss.	737.2909362695849
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	1212.6056269186092
Better be careful not to
get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	1502.6274552676887
He went in, bowing his head
under the low lintel.	1569.9784461510692
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	1875.0233930359254
Before sitting down he
peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	1616.3748337154218
The king was in his
countinghouse.	1130.4478357403395
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
on his bared knees.	2047.453757977721
Something new and easy.	1196.2938424605543
No great hurry.	946.4336915828404
Keep it a
bit.	524.9511986974383
Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_.	592.3640888758189
Payment at the rate of one guinea a
column has been made to the writer.	1427.1324720271175
Three and a half.	729.116421649839
Three pounds
three.	946.4292464214541
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	600.1619857331907
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding
but resisting, began the second.	1856.3362205427134
Midway, his last resistance yielding,
he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading
still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	2168.3025696626746
Hope
it’s not too big bring on piles again.	1302.3172932467214
No, just right.	946.4292464214541
Ah! Costive.	592.3640888758189
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	1376.8650244983396
Life might be so.	991.8960599955972
It did not move or
touch him but it was something quick and neat.	1531.5507733233721
Print anything now.	946.4336915828404
Silly season.	592.3640888758189
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	1823.7426598089717
Neat
certainly.	592.3640888758189
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won
the laughing witch who now_.	1480.8072827184399
Begins and ends morally.	1196.3022706333559
_Hand in hand_.	946.4336915828404
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his
water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	1487.3935314022156
Might manage a sketch.	1196.3022706333559
By Mr and Mrs L.	592.3640888758189
Invent a story for
some proverb.	1512.0784438017395
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what
she said dressing.	1606.1986397693086
Dislike dressing together.	946.4336915828404
Nicked myself shaving.	946.4336915828404
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	1823.6615265732014
Timing her.	592.3640888758189
9.15.	592.3640888758189
Did Roberts pay you yet?	1039.4127464487399
9.20.	592.3640888758189
What had Gretta Conroy on?	592.3640888758189
9.23.	592.3640888758189
What possessed me to buy this comb?	1616.7134097943347
9.24.	592.3640888758189
I’m swelled after that
cabbage.	1512.093573887422
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	1692.1867623118515
Morning
after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the
hours.	991.7449479628592
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
night hours.	1911.3264964488756
Washing her teeth.	946.415910520381
That was the first night.	687.3956063270354
Her head
dancing.	946.4336915828404
Her fansticks clicking.	946.4336915828404
Is that Boylan well off?	784.6724058811368
He has money.	946.4336915828404
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	1264.8774062094265
No use
humming then.	1196.3022706333559
Allude to it.	528.9591260596271
Strange kind of music that last night.	1080.4675816760375
The
mirror was in shadow.	1376.9235816127775
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
vest against her full wagging bub.	1976.3108944965923
Peering into it.	647.1690971058431
Lines in her eyes.	503.0883598314606
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.	1512.1101898786872
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	1334.6363641866324
Night hours then: black with
daggers and eyemasks.	1700.0648950022423
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then
black.	1767.7661165133352
Still, true to life also.	1185.2622985170901
Day: then the night.	590.8987470519114
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	1823.8130060305919
He pulled
back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
into the air.	1431.221072909503
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully
his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	2148.610571981072
What
time is the funeral?	665.4081025906544
Better find out in the paper.	643.9271577851713
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	1361.4858919650437
The bells of George’s
church.	660.8604001077249
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	1452.719898330709
Quarter to.	592.3640888758189
There again: the overtone following through the air.	1006.4095629929393
A
third.	592.3640888758189
Poor Dignam!
	592.3640888758189
By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph
office.	1003.4980967569265
Could have given that address too.	1334.6269614588275
And past the sailors’ home.	1376.822340700769
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
Lime street.	1277.2280231685932
By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	1934.8832213753537
A smaller girl with scars of
eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered
caskhoop.	1885.7646761823694
Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.	1304.805296368478
O let him! His life
isn’t such a bed of roses.	1263.561431824397
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	1616.8120865392227
Come
home to ma, da.	1376.8532560291367
He crossed Townsend
street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	1039.4039578357276
El, yes: house of: Aleph,
Beth.	748.7545201171381
And past Nichols’ the undertaker.	784.6746171349943
At eleven it is.	562.2210858172108
Time enough.	592.3640888758189
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s.	784.6712636600851
Singing with his
eyes shut.	634.3463803820408
Met her once in the park.	642.0769892752602
In the dark.	489.32886922182126
What a lark.	737.2874734175336
Police tout.	592.3640888758189
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom
tooraloom tay.	1325.4646475399113
O, surely he bagged it.	1376.8650244983396
Bury him cheap in a
whatyoumaycall.	1511.5274920076074
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	530.0248432344988
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
finest quality, family tea.	1200.7220734701511
Rather warm.	592.3640888758189
Must get some from Tom
Kernan.	748.7527617590948
Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though.	1547.9886480313721
While his eyes still
read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	1550.1271796201784
Very warm
morning.	946.4336915828404
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the
leather headband inside his high grade ha.	1553.9724646073942
Just there.	592.3640888758189
His right hand
came down into the bowl of his hat.	1155.9538714984385
His fingers found quickly a card
behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	1664.8098587730885
So warm.	592.3640888758189
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
hair.	1455.1920348909832
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	1318.2042831093538
The far east.	946.4336915828404
Lovely spot it
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	1456.2425372677203
Wonder is it like
that.	614.0375012805432
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
not doing a hand’s turn all day.	1386.6697728734289
Sleep six months out of twelve.	1335.4639695309925
Too
hot to quarrel.	1196.2980565823661
Influence of the climate.	1195.3654486092223
Flowers of
idleness.	946.4336915828404
The air feeds most.	1196.3022706333559
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	592.3640888758189
Sensitive plants.	592.3640888758189
Petals too tired to.	991.9754505088239
Sleeping sickness
in the air.	472.5927921925993
Walk on roseleaves.	946.4336915828404
Imagine trying to eat tripe and
cowheel.	1616.7618226339696
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	1029.692693113154
Ah yes, in
the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	1536.3973084313027
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	1823.8913961557264
Because the weight of
the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the
weight of the what?	1015.8962037043681
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	1024.6955316484614
It’s a
law something like that.	851.2048597678445
Vance in High school cracking his
fingerjoints, teaching.	1196.3007123357247
The college curriculum.	946.4336915828404
Cracking curriculum.	592.3640888758189
What is weight really when you say the weight?	1557.3900449888727
Thirtytwo feet per
second per second.	655.7342803081787
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	953.9964663814274
They
all fall to the ground.	812.4246450841252
The earth.	592.3640888758189
It’s the force of gravity of the
earth is the weight.	1355.6413785037237
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	1151.1385403632316
How did she walk with her
sausages?	1616.6307431876921
Like that something.	946.4203558902273
As he walked he took the folded
_Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a
baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	1760.0283605739162
Careless air: just drop in to see.	1137.1076422524393
Per second per second.	604.129070022397
Per second
for every second it means.	1373.7714302365491
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance
through the door of the postoffice.	1280.9749854547172
Too late box.	946.4292464214541
Post here.	592.3640888758189
No-one.	592.3640888758189
He handed the card through the brass grill.	1699.8022219199981
—Are there any letters for me?	1011.5540474826536
he asked.	168.4727106542555
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	2047.983616465988
No answer
probably.	946.4336915828404
Went too far last time.	1040.6474222363183
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
letter.	1733.648699345055
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	1823.607520285946
Henry Flower Esq,
c/o P.	592.3640888758189
Westland Row,
	592.3640888758189
Answered anyhow.	592.3640888758189
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	1873.3893754600185
Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?	748.7545201171381
Castoff soldier.	592.3640888758189
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	1512.1139585474602
No, he’s a
grenadier.	800.0536344280757
Pointed cuffs.	592.3640888758189
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	748.7421745413916
Too showy.	592.3640888758189
That must be why the women go after them.	1626.4612015639345
Easier to enlist and drill.	1376.8650244983396
Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off
O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	1038.5026336587046
Griffith’s
paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:
overseas or halfseasover empire.	1747.7994877210022
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	1512.1246122890575
Eyes front.	592.3640888758189
Mark time.	592.3640888758189
Table: able.	592.3640888758189
Bed: ed.	592.3640888758189
The King’s own.	841.8025462520168
Never see
him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	1747.5154512309912
A mason, yes.	946.4336915828404
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	696.6176012857856
Talk: as if
that would mend matters.	1452.6964028730417
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	1786.2909308467722
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think.	779.8413809330111
His fingers drew forth the
letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	1418.3521653609312
Something
pinned on: photo perhaps.	1376.866034962473
M’Coy.	592.3640888758189
Get rid of him quickly.	1376.882767061861
Take me out of my way.	655.6827190087421
Hate company when
you.	1196.2756746548453
—Hello, Bloom.	592.3640888758189
Where are you off to?	1020.3483330745671
—Hello, M’Coy.	592.3640888758189
Nowhere in particular.	737.2874734175336
—How’s the body?	991.7958312744896
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
	1682.6670821291918
—Is there any...	946.4203558902273
no trouble I hope?	698.106765478086
I see you’re...	1196.2847365797281
—O, no, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Poor Dignam, you know.	467.1271615651108
The funeral is today.	991.9824392102742
—To be sure, poor fellow.	1096.0812577542497
So it is.	345.8160364225982
What time?	592.3640888758189
A photo it isn’t.	1376.9335154795244
A badge maybe.	946.4336915828404
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	592.3640888758189
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said.	822.412769091464
Eleven, is it?	338.4313499265509
I only heard
it last night.	1070.5685337272503
Who was telling me?	502.2261043177113
You know Hoppy?	592.3640888758189
—I know.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
of the Grosvenor.	977.7894613390672
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	1351.9651794443312
She
stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
searched his pockets for change.	1933.9453477856794
Stylish kind of coat with that roll
collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	2047.5142680843512
Careless
stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	1538.7443333188035
Like that haughty
creature at the polo match.	1699.852328306437
Women all for caste till you touch the
spot.	1513.114002576657
Handsome is and handsome does.	1376.8572642759873
Reserved about to yield.	1196.2621829357568
The
honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	946.420355076872
Possess her once take
the starch out of her.	926.2472550036185
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do
you call him Bantam Lyons.	813.2372544525659
Just down there in Conway’s we were.	913.795232659058
Doran Lyons in Conway’s.	592.3640888758189
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	1278.3357414508669
In came
Hoppy.	592.3640888758189
Having a wet.	946.4248011905848
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
braided drums.	1750.7598692431884
Clearly I can see today.	1039.402554977637
Moisture about gives long sight
perhaps.	1512.138816961438
Talking of one thing or another.	917.6617527931411
Lady’s hand.	593.515907822105
Which side will
she get up?	1197.4655927156741
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
said.	784.6724058661538
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	394.2307041882751
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	748.3294466439876
High brown boots with laces
dangling.	1512.1352658891194
Wellturned foot.	592.3640888758189
What is he foostering over that change for?	1700.0700424044232
Sees me looking.	946.4292464214541
Eye out for other fellow always.	1512.0837423672433
Good fallback.	592.3640888758189
Two
strings to her bow.	1185.1925424114113
—_Why?_ I said.	592.3640888758189
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	991.9824392102742
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head.	1009.6911822531301
—_What’s wrong with him_?	1185.263168419412
He said.	592.3640888758189
_He’s dead_, he said.	637.6532158957044
And, faith, he
filled up.	1376.8582747344253
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	592.3640888758189
I said.	592.3640888758189
I couldn’t believe it when I
heard it.	947.0109803182501
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it
in the Arch.	707.9357095523984
_He’s gone.	593.5228089795995
He died on Monday, poor
fellow_.	748.7545201171381
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	1082.0154678135393
A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	1700.070883610277
Curse your noisy pugnose.	1196.3022706333559
Paradise and
the peri.	1195.288146202863
Always happening like that.	579.7440903109887
The very moment.	737.2909362695849
Girl in Eustace
street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	987.6146145814246
Her friend covering
the display of.	1334.6394984236003
_Esprit de corps_.	946.4336915828404
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	1018.0294387977992
Another gone.	592.3640888758189
—One of the best, M’Coy said.	592.5924440100998
The tram passed.	946.4336915828404
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
gloved hand on the steel grip.	1327.9049684788145
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	1578.768555245773
—Wife well, I suppose?	592.3640888758189
M’Coy’s changed voice said.	947.3589696970531
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
	1626.5308714162902
What is home without
	899.5932514645457
—My missus has just got an engagement.	1172.8029353787226
At least it’s not settled yet.	1176.1020207891886
Valise tack again.	946.4336915828404
By the way no harm.	812.3335634442693
I’m off that, thanks.	1185.2698487466155
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	1512.119877235396
—My wife too, he said.	548.9213268692572
She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the
Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	1247.0887747336353
M’Coy said.	592.3640888758189
Glad to hear that, old man.	918.2296662509676
Who’s getting it up?	548.3498536027017
Mrs Marion Bloom.	592.3640888758189
Not up yet.	946.4336915828404
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread
and.	1699.9908064832016
No book.	592.3640888758189
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	1767.7688841065128
Dark lady and fair man.	1376.8572643548641
Torn strip of
envelope.	1196.2938424605543
Love’s
	592.3640888758189
Comes lo-ove’s old...	1376.8859090436579
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	673.6679555828828
_Sweeeet song_.	592.3640888758189
Part shares and part
profits.	878.3780628965003
M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	1298.5542138497385
—O, well, he said.	457.026074686386
That’s good news.	1196.2938424605543
He moved to go.	773.3407227536619
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	812.7299464913223
Meet you knocking around.	1196.3022706333559
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
—Tell you what, M’Coy said.	592.3640888758189
You might put down my name at the funeral,
will you?	1418.5985231728903
I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see.	968.5492631906783
There’s a
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
would have to go down if the body is found.	1420.5708499011484
You just shove in my name
if I’m not there, will you?	1179.21373703049
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	1048.3758588243538
That’ll be all right.	385.5543012919396
—Right, M’Coy said brightly.	784.6724058811368
Thanks, old man.	593.5060833076691
I’d go if I possibly
could.	885.1480786020281
Well, tolloll.	592.3640888758189
Just C.	592.3640888758189
M’Coy will do.	633.0127204484563
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	766.5420220018984
Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze.	1616.8228055439354
The quick touch.	946.4336915828404
Soft mark.	592.3640888758189
I’d
like my job.	1376.848708172084
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	1322.56796167491
Capped
corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	1700.070883610277
Bob Cowley lent him
his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings
of it from that good day to this.	1597.1542625178643
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	724.1084873131331
My missus has
just got an.	1039.7135318800124
Reedy freckled soprano.	946.4336915828404
Cheeseparing nose.	592.3640888758189
Nice enough in
its way: for a little ballad.	1362.4835983639246
No guts in it.	654.5282305937217
You and me, don’t you
know: in the same boat.	752.1825322559401
Give you the needle that would.	1334.5614402748527
Can’t he hear the difference?	1512.0766374610234
Think he’s that way inclined a bit.	1298.817318086628
Against my grain somehow.	1196.3022706333559
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	946.4336915828393
I hope
that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.	1692.158639833895
Suppose she wouldn’t let
herself be vaccinated again.	1333.0507890674155
Your wife and my wife.	943.5107567759859
Wonder is he pimping after me?	1334.6613752244662
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings.	1340.863635498481
Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	592.3640888758189
Clery’s
Summer Sale.	592.3640888758189
No, he’s going on straight.	934.8968183631421
Mrs
Bandmann Palmer.	592.3640888758189
_Hamlet_ she played
last night.	909.7532975890475
Male impersonator.	592.3640888758189
Perhaps he was a woman.	422.2273069785177
Why Ophelia
committed suicide.	841.8114424048898
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in
that.	710.80023306432
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	984.189707710841
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	1196.3339899073414
And Ristori in Vienna.	592.3640888758189
What
is this the right name is?	1109.0330554006937
By Mosenthal it is.	395.6225402394829
Rachel, is it?	338.4313499265509
The
scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham
recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	1245.477120450476
Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left
his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of
his father and left the God of his father.	1022.6793197851086
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	946.4047954247238
Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his
face.	819.3480376543017
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
him.	768.259369268306
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
hazard.	1171.5733792131518
No use thinking of it any more.	1305.335241435875
Nosebag time.	592.3640888758189
Wish I hadn’t met
that M’Coy fellow.	809.5622085590553
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently
champing teeth.	1976.3999453101626
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	1763.4166705823473
Their Eldorado.	592.3640888758189
Poor jugginses! Damn
all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
nosebags.	1735.5196290789472
Too full for words.	822.5531718577369
Still they get their feed all right and
their doss.	1692.1806990027476
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
between their haunches.	1911.3220072389565
Might be happy all the same that way.	838.3204588035675
Good poor
brutes they look.	1376.8495037818602
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	1616.7845946299472
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
carried.	1207.3296405196966
Might just walk into her here.	1512.1031860257617
The lane is safer.	1196.3022706333559
He passed the cabman’s shelter.	866.8955837649984
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	1197.4465225801348
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	1686.8871417960893
_Voglio e non_.	737.2943990675084
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	1452.7053583969089
Shout a
few flying syllables as they pass.	1548.0050189105436
He hummed:
	592.3640888758189
Là ci darem la mano
	1020.3543852333053
La la lala la la.	1376.8631653801776
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in
the lee of the station wall.	1568.19875305959
No-one.	592.3640888758189
Meade’s timberyard.	946.4336915828404
Piled balks.	592.3640888758189
Ruins and tenements.	946.4336915828404
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch
court with its forgotten pickeystone.	1837.067826170984
Not a sinner.	946.4292464214541
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	1871.0252966973317
Pity to
disturb them.	1196.2938424605543
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	1420.7508990648487
Open it.	592.3640888758189
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s
school.	1074.8438645895674
She liked mignonette.	946.4336915828404
Mrs Ellis’s.	592.3640888758189
And Mr?	592.3640888758189
He opened the letter
within the newspaper.	1616.7472657485066
A flower.	592.3640888758189
I think it’s a.	679.6122718002907
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	1512.1352658891174
Not
annoyed then?	946.4336915828404
What does she say?	1196.2812000128506
Dear Henry
	592.3640888758189
I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	1313.944268598267
I am sorry
you did not like my last letter.	1823.7512777026168
Why did you enclose the stamps?	1512.1043520651895
I am
awfully angry with you.	1087.3388136054566
I do wish I could punish you for that.	767.2406576291297
I called
you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	602.7590910382612
Please tell me
what is the real meaning of that word?	1102.3141293699066
Are you not happy in your home
you poor little naughty boy?	776.8158371419055
I do wish I could do something for you.	701.683698831768
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	1240.7844954678824
I often think of the
beautiful name you have.	995.9664325082764
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	770.6487514289512
I think of you
so often you have no idea.	1531.7412073741923
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a
man as you.	1606.1872737907295
I feel so bad about.	1376.8454952472946
Please write me a long letter and tell
me more.	1266.3633421679579
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	702.5814940428193
So now you know what
I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	1098.9841788994481
O how I long to
meet you.	1081.985541271464
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
exhausted.	1195.0876329744724
Then I will tell you all.	600.7848065361057
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
have such a bad headache.	788.3783134412134
and write _by return_ to your longing
	2417.3277047437728
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	845.5340736115179
I want to
know.	528.0260185585066
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
and placed it in his heart pocket.	1782.3944283716778
Language of flowers.	946.4259588536014
They like it
because no-one can hear.	1283.656193731589
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	1700.0430559193221
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your
cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear
roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s
perfume.	1514.9999336049582
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it
back in his sidepocket.	1185.5995694718952
Weak joy opened his lips.	870.0534573081682
Changed since the first letter.	1376.705074869833
Wonder did
she wrote it herself.	1512.0918748596882
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like
me, respectable character.	1686.9634501882335
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	714.5358503915139
Thank you: not having any.	1376.8507300941508
Usual love scrimmage.	946.4336915828404
Then running round
corners.	1196.2938424605543
Bad as a row with Molly.	782.4838054586595
Cigar has a cooling effect.	1376.7982050458547
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	1276.1539396345634
Brutal, why not?	507.19202448485635
Try it anyhow.	737.2943990675084
A bit at a time.	756.6911611387785
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	923.6648122984731
Common pin, eh?	946.4336915828404
He threw it on the road.	593.8193814711999
Out of her clothes somewhere:
pinned together.	1452.5119874650777
Queer the number of pins they always have.	1299.5536698457572
No roses
without thorns.	1196.3022706333559
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	773.4067437556207
Those two sluts that night in
the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	901.8369310728295
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	915.0381789144701
She didn’t know what to do
	441.2420851929741
To keep it up,
	361.5994960689337
To keep it up.	361.5994960689337
Such a bad headache.	745.9379938799432
Has her roses probably.	1196.3022706333559
Or sitting all
day typing.	1376.8426386823448
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	1376.8495037818602
What perfume does your
wife use.	580.4954426984425
Now could you make out a thing like that?	621.6565655121109
To keep it up.	361.5994960689337
Martha, Mary.	592.3640888758189
He is sitting in their house, talking.	1616.6046843242625
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	1106.3868352049312
To keep it up.	361.5994960689337
Nice kind of evening feeling.	1376.7941957087
No more wandering about.	1196.3022706333559
Just loll there:
quiet dusk: let everything rip.	1409.7109930763902
Tell about places you have
been, strange customs.	1700.0161520144554
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the
supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like
the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	1517.2724050586498
Must carry a paper goblet next time I
go to the trottingmatches.	1162.5583494323364
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	1452.721703309083
Tell
her: more and more: all.	1334.6112896664836
Then a sigh: silence.	1196.3044655071815
Long long long rest.	991.964967016193
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	1513.1203404979685
The shreds fluttered
away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	2003.2958694234464
Henry Flower.	592.3640888758189
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
same way.	1288.2821928731018
Simple bit of paper.	773.2652792674191
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	1333.283790072033
Shows you the money to be
made out of porter.	1279.3418585651775
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	1376.8650244983396
A
million pounds, wait a moment.	836.2291181904162
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
porter.	1653.229770927537
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	1616.8097869429505
Yes, exactly.	592.3640888758189
Fifteen
millions of barrels of porter.	1197.4408975905815
What am I saying barrels?	784.6746171349943
About a million barrels all the
same.	787.5563506298579
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	1871.094821397981
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	1647.4624458531785
The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	2082.9515508085187
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	974.7534684850893
Stepping into the
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
again behind the leather headband.	1573.3210785778435
Damn it.	592.3640888758189
I might have tried to work
M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	1017.0979371451332
Same notice on the door.	717.0032863516836
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	606.5029763288852
on saint Peter Claver S.	784.8016231997758
and the African Mission.	361.7996330419932
Prayers for the
conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	1109.2161508909353
The protestants are the same.	739.8347247390745
Convert Dr William J.	592.3640888758189
Walsh D.D.	592.3640888758189
to the
true religion.	1437.9013543112394
Save China’s millions.	841.8114424048898
Wonder how they explain it to the
heathen Chinee.	1083.271334440606
Prefer an ounce of opium.	1185.278999462763
Rank heresy for
them.	698.1136495319619
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	1365.1800429185091
Taking it easy
with hand under his cheek.	1548.0471980518619
Josssticks burning.	592.3640888758189
Not like Ecce Homo.	592.3640888758189
Crown of thorns and cross.	1376.8650244983396
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	748.7545201171381
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	946.431468999537
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of
that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.	1263.5034624068007
They’re taught that.	1196.3022706333559
He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to
baptise blacks, is he?	1759.1179700064745
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	1452.7195406231626
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
listening.	1595.347965612934
Still life.	592.3640888758189
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	752.1483436420949
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	1548.0553780525784
He trod the worn steps,
pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	1873.1506793135134
Something going on: some sodality.	1185.2540170795821
Pity so empty.	946.4336915828404
Nice discreet place
to be next some girl.	1548.0045585045486
Who is my neighbour?	1196.251699060335
Jammed by the hour to slow
music.	1373.3693102309485
That woman at midnight mass.	1376.8505145911975
Seventh heaven.	592.3640888758189
Women knelt in the
benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	1946.4227742590874
A batch
knelt at the altarrails.	1334.4161860007011
The priest went along by them, murmuring,
holding the thing in his hands.	1347.800126977936
He stopped at each, took out a
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
neatly into her mouth.	1722.9979029860078
Her hat and head sank.	1376.8095593467228
Then the next one.	745.9380643795216
Her
hat sank at once.	926.8557894212288
Then the next one: a small old woman.	1278.3622208396932
The priest bent
down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	972.2114513198086
The next
one.	737.2909362695849
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	1305.2178241128083
_Corpus:_ body.	946.4336915828404
Good idea the Latin.	592.3640888758189
Hospice for the dying.	822.1812716410552
They
don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	1539.2083611957169
Rum idea: eating bits of a
corpse.	1373.118045094086
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
one, and seek their places.	1725.753603866205
He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	1856.3612697901199
These pots we have to wear.	990.1462323908494
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	1380.0921375068538
Something like those mazzoth: it’s that
sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	1608.356022594832
Look at them.	737.2684989818955
Now I bet it makes
them feel happy.	1126.1126034645338
It does.	592.3640888758189
Yes, bread of angels it’s called.	1616.9862887993672
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you
feel.	1320.2591024047042
First communicants.	592.3640888758189
Hokypoky penny a lump.	991.9684620356705
Then feel all like one
family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	1517.0527705967352
They do.	592.3640888758189
I’m
sure of that.	770.2376441802206
Not so lonely.	647.1812560548422
In our confraternity.	946.4336915828404
Then come out a bit
spreeish.	1512.0580976479723
Let off steam.	946.4336915828404
Thing is if you really believe in it.	1042.7461496142637
Lourdes
cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	1275.2347634615783
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	1512.138816961438
Hence those snores.	946.4336915828404
Blind
faith.	592.3640888758189
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	1189.762969462224
Lulls all pain.	946.4336915828404
Wake this time
next year.	1376.8447749743186
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
affair he had on.	1935.455440688316
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	669.5383000691369
He wouldn’t know what
to do to.	782.7562282944268
Bald spot behind.	946.4336915828404
Letters on his back: I.N.R.I?	592.7626340709264
No: I.H.S.	592.3640888758189
Molly told me one time I asked her.	792.4136663141012
I have sinned: or no: I have
suffered, it is.	884.4342903606868
And the other one?	899.6156862062755
Iron nails ran in.	822.5589667907208
Do not deny my request.	1020.3543852333053
Dusk and the light behind her.	1511.271315480303
She might be here
with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
sly.	1344.733524455252
Their character.	592.3640888758189
That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the
invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
every morning.	1308.0041403744026
This very church.	946.4336915828404
Peter Carey, yes.	592.3640888758189
No, Peter Claver I
am thinking of.	885.1352156789851
Denis Carey.	592.3640888758189
And just imagine that.	1196.2896284392518
And plotting that murder all the time.	757.189955278398
Those
crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something
shiftylooking about them.	1288.6360053367132
They’re not straight men of business either.	1548.0675924672416
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no.	1165.403012244273
By the way, did I tear up
that envelope?	1106.449984931601
Yes: under the bridge.	991.8064431190279
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
smartly.	1976.1908543792185
Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	1428.3017747850736
Cold comfort.	592.3640888758189
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one
old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	1849.3614999126191
Queer
the whole atmosphere of the.	989.6545548135831
Quite right.	592.3640888758189
Perfectly right that is.	638.3355445922108
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	1188.289974119734
Not going to be any music.	1087.2574572247017
Who has the organ here I wonder?	885.1204948906504
Old Glynn he knew how to make
that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he
had in Gardiner street.	1160.9199039614994
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat
Mater_ of Rossini.	999.6605114671371
Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first.	946.4336915828393
Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it.	1364.4530349727786
Footdrill stopped.	592.3640888758189
Could hear a pin drop.	1376.8417430159382
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
people looking up:
	1419.2764221846553
_Quis est homo._
	1196.3022706333559
Some of that old sacred music splendid.	1616.596504192671
Mercadante: seven last words.	699.0624590261338
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	752.0365801953429
Those old popes keen on music,
on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	1905.4968835603315
Palestrina for example
too.	1196.2829405005664
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	1767.6341752869862
Healthy too, chanting,
regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	1700.0678893036238
Green Chartreuse.	592.3640888758189
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	1782.5898944314022
What kind of voice is it?	904.1888795155834
Must be curious to hear after their own
strong basses.	1823.8236687661151
Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.	1218.7023063364652
Kind of a placid.	1195.2941043050794
No worry.	592.3640888758189
Fall into flesh, don’t they?	1103.9418019166148
Gluttons,
tall, long legs.	1196.3022706333559
Who knows?	592.3640888758189
One way out of it.	410.93419360797697
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
bless all the people.	1744.8929895067865
All crossed themselves and stood up.	1023.4779486845688
Mr Bloom
glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	1605.9909312203674
Stand
up at the gospel of course.	825.2682399019122
Then all settled down on their knees again
and he sat back quietly in his bench.	1433.7110273285673
The priest came down from the
altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered
each other in Latin.	1422.9319491243236
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
card:
	1303.8030241302326
—O God, our refuge and our strength...	862.030209178363
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	1311.8198721724589
Throw them
the bone.	899.5353808147327
I remember slightly.	946.4336915828404
How long since your last mass?	1512.1246126500039
Glorious
and immaculate virgin.	1196.3022706333559
Joseph, her spouse.	737.2943990675084
Peter and Paul.	592.3640888758189
More
interesting if you understood what it was all about.	1443.1758141159128
Wonderful
organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	1512.1352658891174
Everyone wants
to.	737.2606705890719
Then I will tell you all.	600.7848065361057
Punish me, please.	946.4336915828404
Great weapon
in their hands.	872.4320794619406
More than doctor or solicitor.	1376.8650244983396
Woman dying to.	946.4215135713408
And I
schschschschschsch.	592.3640888758189
And did you chachachachacha?	1196.265585335175
And why did you?	699.059958626434
Look
down at her ring to find an excuse.	1767.7119020602013
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	1020.3572606531001
Husband learn to his surprise.	1376.5174742173228
God’s little joke.	1196.2854140044617
Then out she comes.	1196.3033680726708
Repentance skindeep.	592.3640888758189
Lovely shame.	592.3640888758189
Pray at an altar.	991.9484042217099
Hail Mary and Holy
Mary.	592.3640888758189
Flowers, incense, candles melting.	1196.3022706333559
Hide her blushes.	946.4336915828404
Salvation
army blatant imitation.	1196.3022706333559
Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	1334.6426329393762
How I found the Lord.	592.3640888758189
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they
work the whole show.	1263.5021241260492
And don’t they rake in the money too?	1433.5857919033635
Bequests
also: to the P.P.	660.8635041589657
for the time being in his absolute discretion.	1121.9003961878543
Masses
for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	1617.8495526100317
Monasteries and convents.	946.4336915828404
The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the
witnessbox.	1040.2374901956782
No browbeating him.	946.4336915828404
He had his answer pat for everything.	1616.7976155888025
Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church.	1496.5655638220014
The doctors of
the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	1324.6898682006465
The priest prayed:
	946.4336915828404
—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	1022.4387850796495
Be our
safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of
souls.	1364.3290101043626
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	1364.4657405111845
All over.	592.3640888758189
The women
remained behind: thanksgiving.	1376.8650244983396
Better be shoving along.	1196.2980565823646
Brother Buzz.	592.3640888758189
Come around with the plate
perhaps.	1511.3278164748676
Pay your Easter duty.	592.3640888758189
He stood up.	556.5679096831182
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
time?	1154.5382471021085
Never tell you.	431.5775300786067
But we.	592.3640888758189
Excuse, miss, there’s a
(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	1357.9464818331362
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	1512.138816961438
Glimpses of the moon.	434.2075543828889
Annoyed if you don’t.	407.7683904842051
Why didn’t you tell me
before.	1189.48340427771
Still like you better untidy.	1376.8592853082118
Good job it wasn’t farther south.	1218.6944776345242
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the
main door into the light.	1546.7929661524436
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black
marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive
hands in the low tide of holy water.	2185.125448248593
Trams: a car of Prescott’s
dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	1263.5051276030033
Notice because I’m in mourning myself.	972.1979544705163
He covered himself.	946.4292464214541
How goes the time?	654.585388185355
Quarter past.	592.3640888758189
Time enough yet.	946.4336915828404
Better get that lotion made up.	1512.0883235366268
Where is this?	593.5083534005756
Sweny’s in Lincoln place.	592.3640888758189
Chemists rarely move.	946.4336915828404
Their green and gold
beaconjars too heavy to stir.	1767.7329047767214
Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of
the flood.	1009.4643722302935
Huguenot churchyard near there.	1196.2980565823661
Visit some day.	946.415910520381
He walked southward along Westland row.	748.7545201171381
But the recipe is in the other
trousers.	1050.9077875916253
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	1082.0132898299269
Bore this funeral affair.	1196.3022706333559
O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault.	1380.1342430400707
When was it I got it made up
last?	1106.4176804434503
I changed a sovereign I remember.	748.7545201171381
First of the month it
must have been or the second.	987.0137941536678
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions
book.	1193.686172813673
The chemist turned back page after page.	1616.8097869429505
Sandy shrivelled smell he
seems to have.	1234.3533457410037
Shrunken skull.	592.3640888758189
Quest for the philosopher’s
stone.	1511.6910191442723
The alchemists.	592.3640888758189
Drugs age you after mental excitement.	1512.1290883859974
Lethargy
then.	592.3640888758189
A lifetime in a night.	1376.1854524512676
Gradually changes your
character.	1196.3022706333559
Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	1474.2008014341932
All his alabaster lilypots.	1196.3022706333559
Te
Virid.	592.3640888758189
Smell almost cure you like the dentist’s doorbell.	1557.2889708941605
Doctor Whack.	592.3640888758189
He ought to physic himself a bit.	1188.5271892253254
Electuary or emulsion.	946.4336915828404
The first
fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck.	1593.790522005006
Want to be careful.	1196.1656902529191
Enough stuff here to chloroform you.	1512.117509569745
Test: turns
blue litmus paper red.	1512.1352658891194
Overdose of laudanum.	946.4336915828404
Sleeping
draughts.	592.3640888758189
Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough.	1376.8495037818602
Clogs the
pores or the phlegm.	1511.9735933911286
Poisons the only cures.	1196.233915377584
Remedy where you least
expect it.	1512.1148834282446
Clever of nature.	556.5784433357392
—About a fortnight ago, sir?	1376.862154902959
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	2098.890891555874
Lot of time taken up telling
your aches and pains.	1823.8497789247324
—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
orangeflower water...	1155.6520031104885
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	1871.0613359809138
—And white wax also, he said.	796.1604701467124
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	1039.379079407349
Looking at me, the sheet up to her
eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
cuffs.	1322.9607160257751
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2098.9180454728676
One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it?	944.3403585189648
Leopold, yes.	592.3640888758189
Three we have.	946.3724326903674
Warts, bunions and pimples to
make it worse.	1427.1653624186906
But you want a perfume too.	1334.636677662083
What perfume does your?	749.3151593264641
That orangeflower water is so fresh.	1512.0980493938837
Nice smell these
soaps have.	1376.861144421135
Pure curd soap.	946.4336915828404
Time to get a bath round the corner.	848.1691886619083
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	1452.7483597642308
Nicer if a
nice girl did it.	1616.7016645537856
Also I think I.	592.3640888758189
Yes I.	592.3640888758189
Do it in the bath.	487.68443821338315
Curious
longing I.	592.3640888758189
Water to water.	946.4336915828404
Combine business with pleasure.	822.5481314743755
Pity no time
for massage.	1376.8486552798256
Funeral be rather glum.	1196.3022706333559
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	878.3632107366487
That was two and nine.	756.7714352754112
Have you brought a
bottle?	1376.862039639021
—No, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Make it up, please.	1196.413322223589
I’ll call later in the day and
I’ll take one of these soaps.	1166.605881830684
How much are they?	773.289613095578
—Fourpence, sir.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	1182.347811984502
Sweet lemony wax.	946.4336915828404
—I’ll take this one, he said.	676.7497237419457
That makes three and a penny.	792.7029548972996
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	878.3632107366487
You can pay all together, sir, when you
come back.	1387.7062560701293
—Good, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	1217.6234451925184
At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:
	946.4188739172172
—Hello, Bloom.	592.3640888758189
What’s the best news?	600.023906680924
Is that today’s?	1196.3022706333559
Show us a minute.	803.3236045704804
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	1122.220822959237
To look
younger.	946.4336915828404
He does look balmy.	1196.3022706333559
Younger than I am.	592.3640888758189
Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	1512.1364495789662
Wants a
wash too.	1196.2938424605543
Take off the rough dirt.	1376.6863458527744
Good morning, have you used Pears’
soap?	885.1523324519588
Dandruff on his shoulders.	745.8505901007927
Scalp wants oiling.	946.4336915828404
—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam
Lyons said.	837.386403945365
Where the bugger is it?	742.8795113022178
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	1738.0409069376014
Barber’s itch.	946.4336915828404
Tight collar he’ll lose his hair.	1305.2426515293403
Better leave him the
paper and get shut of him.	1062.7718258127538
—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	650.6156573795939
Gold cup.	592.3640888758189
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	592.3640888758189
Half a mo.	946.4336915828404
Maximum the
second.	647.1432197710551
—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	622.958240744027
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	1332.1615536304155
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
his sharp voice said.	1702.2242333550207
—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	705.929725029787
I was going to throw it away
that moment.	874.5865548395265
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.	1354.2607725327189
—I’ll risk it, he said.	610.5446362207607
He sped off towards Conway’s corner.	752.1015273534003
God speed scut.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
in it, smiling.	1803.7748993322286
Silly lips of that chap.	1185.0877014433704
Regular hotbed of it
lately.	1376.9918545265998
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	1287.7988874981404
Raffle for large
tender turkey.	1376.8650244983396
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	894.7896081447772
Jack Fleming
embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	1196.3022706333572
Keeps a hotel now.	1196.3022706333559
They never come back.	803.3675337111312
Fleshpots of Egypt.	592.3640888758189
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	1767.0219041883827
Remind you of a
mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	1625.9742257772734
College sports today I see.	592.3640888758189
He
eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist
doubled up like a cod in a pot.	1840.9374648025419
Damn bad ad.	946.4336915828404
Now if they had made it
round like a wheel.	1627.0789486946323
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the
hub big: college.	1747.346772686487
Something to catch the eye.	771.1658179618424
There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge.	1018.6011251821229
Keep him on hands:
might take a turn in there on the nod.	1326.5490238431235
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	522.9872486779726
How do you do, sir?	712.5749790548193
Heavenly weather really.	946.4336915828404
If life was always like that.	771.4614320778893
Cricket weather.	592.3640888758189
Sit around under sunshades.	1196.3022706333559
Over after over.	946.4336915828404
They can’t play it
here.	1250.3951487240006
Duck for six wickets.	1196.2980565823646
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	1295.6388071159756
Donnybrook fair more in
their line.	1177.7990751885236
And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the
floor.	1006.5431852375386
Won’t last.	946.4336915828404
Always passing, the stream of life, which
in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	1192.9075622740156
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
stream.	1976.3874258039666
This is my body.	991.9370108514028
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	2137.743368798061
He saw his trunk
and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father
of thousands, a languid floating flower.	2185.5609983668965
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	1771.1724919965407
Mr Power stepped in
after him, curving his height with care.	1449.8211366740409
—Come on, Simon.	592.3640888758189
—After you, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
	1512.1169220306483
—Yes, yes.	592.3640888758189
—Are we all here now?	1096.085022252936
Martin Cunningham asked.	592.3640888758189
Come along, Bloom.	592.3640888758189
He pulled the door to
after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	1651.1417711128013
He passed an arm
through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	1797.746962252321
One dragged aside: an old woman
peeping.	1259.9514145297414
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	1185.1670473081824
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	1473.7817119336144
Glad
to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	1632.8839509956995
Job seems to suit them.	1376.8755859477965
Huggermugger in corners.	946.4336915828404
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d
wake.	1433.0018301383316
Then getting it ready.	1196.3094618986881
Laying it out.	556.6286646462138
Molly and Mrs Fleming
making the bed.	618.2131470218176
Pull it more to your side.	1512.0731931941204
Our windingsheet.	592.3640888758189
Never know
who will touch you dead.	1616.8078770748536
Wash and shampoo.	946.4336915828404
I believe they clip the
nails and the hair.	1767.086098574738
Grows all the same
after.	805.7671612844706
Unclean job.	592.3640888758189
All waited.	592.3640888758189
Nothing was said.	946.4248011905848
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	1377.443423206563
I am
sitting on something hard.	1512.1371154844096
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	1616.6752776263675
Better
shift it out of that.	447.2161711158519
Wait for an opportunity.	1196.272365291902
All waited.	592.3640888758189
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
then horses’ hoofs.	1946.1482465220372
A jolt.	592.3640888758189
Their carriage began to move, creaking and
swaying.	1699.9817218395385
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	1616.8228055439354
The blinds of
the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	1723.9591001870408
At walking pace.	946.4248011905848
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks.	1933.8850554510977
Tritonville road.	592.3640888758189
The wheels
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes.	2047.4408371454044
—What way is he taking us?	1334.6566083938392
Mr Power asked through both windows.	1196.3022706333559
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
Brunswick street.	592.3640888758189
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	894.7845651025866
—That’s a fine old custom, he said.	911.1188536780071
I am glad to see it has not died
out.	1378.535146550089
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers.	1911.3438663916381
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past Watery lane.	1406.3430673125224
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
clad in mourning, a wide hat.	1823.8150669443787
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	726.3502381947972
—Who is that?	397.770905500622
—Where is he?	416.2664053616629
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	1196.3022706333559
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	1776.8969510840502
Mr Dedalus
fell back, saying:
	1039.4164384654407
—Was that Mulligan cad with him?	633.1251651814999
His _fidus Achates_!
	592.3640888758189
—No, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He was alone.	946.4336915828404
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	981.6770091071759
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	724.1084873131331
Wallace Bros: the
bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	592.3640888758189
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	1195.6176687421855
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
the firm.	913.8153509415993
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	1373.8135151032209
Great card he was.	729.5558349236481
Waltzing
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.	829.1192458233406
Out on the rampage all night.	1250.120606291295
Wife
ironing his back.	899.5749589110914
Thinks he’ll cure it with pills.	1616.807535461459
All breadcrumbs they
are.	749.2188667155672
About six hundred per cent profit.	1512.1175101472843
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	903.3355907492858
That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	1646.4901756942006
His name stinks
all over Dublin.	946.4336915828393
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
gate.	1442.5708786508462
I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	1409.703544427155
He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
	1699.3789323951914
—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	1533.6139463770498
A counterjumper’s
son.	749.2840292553223
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s.	784.6322369144501
Not likely.	592.3640888758189
He ceased.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	1135.8359054856367
Noisy
selfwilled man.	946.4336915828404
Full of his son.	745.587452380428
He is right.	647.1881268215625
Something to hand on.	1196.3121710340197
If
little Rudy had lived.	675.4879437573965
Hear his voice in the house.	673.5565246117872
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	592.3640888758189
My son.	592.3640888758189
Me in his eyes.	408.21954812620754
From me.	592.3640888758189
Must have been that
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	1335.3380415839804
And the sergeant grinning
up.	1376.8650244983396
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	1737.6146021851407
Give us
a touch, Poldy.	784.6375965869838
God, I’m dying for it.	816.0593416634559
How life begins.	946.4336915828404
Got big then.	946.4336915828404
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	748.7545201171381
My son inside her.	1196.2854140044617
I could have helped him on in life.	1366.8108524354236
I could.	592.3640888758189
Make him independent.	946.4292464214541
Learn German too.	592.3640888758189
—Are we late?	946.4336915828404
Mr Power asked.	592.3640888758189
—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	825.23358509229
Same thing watered down.	1196.3022706333559
Her tomboy oaths.	946.4336915828404
O jumping
Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl.	884.4832866264207
Soon be a
woman.	621.2210852157027
Dearest Papli.	592.3640888758189
Young student.	592.3640888758189
Life, life.	592.3640888758189
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	1823.855060607716
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	1123.8648302631088
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him.	1096.2656935081584
Do
you follow me?	594.1073422691156
He closed his left eye.	1001.2588272775389
Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	1449.7968624200478
—What is this, he said, in the name of God?	531.3923803666271
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
said.	1096.8265199358168
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats.	2002.6256599224866
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:
	1245.5451801875654
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken.	1039.41860477134
What do you think, Martin?	502.643480696916
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	724.1084873131331
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	1196.2854141186838
Glad I took that bath.	894.787086645757
Feel my feet quite
clean.	1376.8582747755074
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	1039.4186047713413
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	841.8114424048898
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.	766.9836300627071
—Did Tom Kernan turn up?	784.6657718872434
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.	1044.1634621141754
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	592.3640888758189
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	706.155333436352
—And Corny Kelleher himself?	592.3640888758189
Mr Power asked.	592.3640888758189
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He said he’d try to come.	883.322639879648
The carriage halted short.	1196.3022706333559
—We’re stopped.	946.4336915828404
—Where are we?	647.1773243467043
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	658.4905121059654
—The grand canal, he said.	637.6514189557978
Whooping cough they say it cures.	1334.6446263638993
Good job Milly never got
it.	835.3365492224365
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	1139.8198999292026
Shame
really.	592.3640888758189
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	1512.1352658891194
Only measles.	592.3640888758189
Flaxseed
tea.	592.3640888758189
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	946.4336915828404
Canvassing for death.	946.4292464214541
Don’t miss
this chance.	1376.861144421135
Dogs’ home over there.	899.5837451901423
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
Leopold, is my last wish.	841.798591773302
Thy will be done.	745.9023197511474
We obey them in the grave.	702.2013125475728
A dying scrawl.	946.4336915828404
He took it to heart, pined away.	1616.8154737794305
Quiet brute.	592.3640888758189
Old men’s
dogs usually are.	1512.0926480404203
A raindrop spat on his hat.	845.0474597922849
He drew back and saw an instant of shower
spray dots over the grey flags.	1905.28138036347
Like through a
colander.	1196.2179761547154
I thought it would.	745.998079059497
My boots were creaking I remember now.	885.1534237904042
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.	1157.4442820831864
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	970.9400586784087
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	650.4501669270969
There’s the sun again coming
out.	1452.6355216496988
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled
a mute curse at the sky.	1735.9744459242197
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.	1188.6754078245351
—We’re off again.	991.9789449784407
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently.	1911.2967226544022
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	1044.1586652172418
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	881.4736308387428
And Paddy Leonard taking
him off to his face.	936.6502338816623
—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	678.2726537994448
Wait till you hear
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	679.9341517960461
—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	784.6746171349943
_His singing of that simple
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
whole course of my experience._
	1237.8893832698327
—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	624.6723327035223
He’s dead nuts on that.	932.8278773548262
And the
retrospective arrangement.	991.9719563386063
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?	724.1055721776142
Martin Cunningham asked.	592.3640888758189
—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	724.0679972933784
Where is it?	338.4313499265509
—In the paper this morning.	870.0478723941395
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	1280.1026862609422
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	748.7545201171381
Later on please.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that?	782.0193507520021
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s?	834.3590444893456
no, Sexton,
Urbright.	592.3640888758189
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	1767.4879441614253
Thanks to the Little Flower.	592.3640888758189
To the inexpressible grief
of his.	1106.607572849166
Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness.	1298.5124902137338
Month’s mind:
Quinlan.	592.3640888758189
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	724.1177899748179
To his home up above in the sky
	1427.5157524875563
While his family weeps and mourns his loss
	1700.0580272687682
Hoping some day to meet him on high.	1474.1705948457854
I tore up the envelope?	1376.7038788370585
Where did I put her letter after I read it
in the bath?	760.309611982045
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	1196.2980565823661
There all right.	392.53412403905105
Dear Henry
fled.	592.3640888758189
Before my patience are exhausted.	812.2994326177367
National school.	592.3640888758189
Meade’s yard.	647.1842956733051
The hazard.	592.3640888758189
Only two there now.	803.3858681739364
Full as a tick.	1195.9584048269255
Too much bone in their skulls.	1511.8980472558933
The other trotting round
with a fare.	1616.0363603200535
An hour ago I was passing there.	795.3074582328946
The jarvies raised their
hats.	1376.8533842206512
A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window.	1407.596022458507
Couldn’t they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	1721.5656161484894
Well but that fellow
would lose his job then?	1626.5307120076677
Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?	1836.998788940777
Antient concert rooms.	737.2943990675084
Nothing on there.	737.2943990675084
A man in a buff suit with a
crape armlet.	1584.7330276345806
Not much grief there.	1196.3022706333559
Quarter mourning.	592.3640888758189
People in law
perhaps.	1196.2738683575353
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence.	1124.1131071342297
Hoardings: Eugene
Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	592.3640888758189
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I
wonder.	692.4923818617686
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	592.3640888758189
Elster Grimes Opera
Company.	592.3640888758189
Big powerful change.	946.4336915828404
Wet bright bills for next week.	1512.1281635529294
_Fun on
the Bristol_.	592.3640888758189
Have
to stand a drink or two.	1323.7354615018028
As broad as it’s long.	1178.126924314729
He’s coming in the afternoon.	1512.6326277593355
Her songs.	592.3640888758189
Plasto’s.	592.3640888758189
Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust.	1082.0154678135393
Who was he?	593.4699552596119
—How do you do?	468.95647039620343
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
salute.	1484.3016166002906
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.	706.6560733013202
Yes, he does.	593.5082708535016
How do you do?	468.95647039620343
Mr Dedalus asked.	592.3640888758189
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	592.3640888758189
There he is airing his quiff.	1512.1103335782434
Just that moment I was thinking.	619.1724741368272
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	1055.8742988974798
From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	1103.088582867905
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand.	1261.6408156004488
The nails, yes.	946.4336915828404
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	1823.7224868637422
Worst man in Dublin.	592.3640888758189
That keeps him alive.	991.9824392102742
They sometimes
feel what a person is.	1616.7666533185613
But a type like that.	771.2722227778028
My nails.	592.3640888758189
I am
just looking at them: well pared.	1548.0513460163722
And after: thinking alone.	1196.3022706333559
Body
getting a bit softy.	1096.132032528529
I would notice that: from remembering.	1512.111332339944
What causes
that?	946.4336915828404
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh
falls off.	1976.2602049770646
But the shape is there.	878.3904063403347
Night of the dance dressing.	1375.9985029851944
Shift stuck between the
cheeks behind.	1512.041874877741
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces.	1834.597800233408
Mr Power asked:
	592.3640888758189
—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	1196.1367111725424
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
I hear great accounts of it.	898.2536808468111
—Are you going yourself?	1196.2979173589902
—Well no, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
In point of fact I have to go down to the
county Clare on some private business.	860.2072489510421
You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns.	1692.108320668464
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	996.6753836824527
—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
Mary Anderson is up there now.	917.3866435127717
Have you good artists?	1196.281199670174
—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	706.1578209475638
O yes, we’ll have all
topnobbers.	1452.6662617232776
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	724.1026569353077
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	619.1677766496383
Last but not least.	991.9414153903886
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and
clasped them.	1453.0631371813956
Smith O’Brien.	592.3640888758189
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	1185.2719045736605
Must be his deathday.	1196.2643416246938
For many happy returns.	1196.3022706333559
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
mouth opening: oot.	1905.1315616339755
—Four bootlaces for a penny.	706.1025575081537
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	1700.0240059372652
Had his office in Hume street.	748.7492449481616
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	673.1147743861916
Has that silk hat ever since.	1512.1318629242796
Relics of old decency.	1196.2264068778948
Mourning too.	592.3640888758189
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	971.1040122022979
O’Callaghan on his last legs.	1196.1898853956327
And _Madame_.	592.3640888758189
Twenty past eleven.	737.2943990675084
Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	1055.8420464883334
Doing
her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	1283.6654260203695
No: _vorrei e non_.	991.9824392102742
Looking
at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	1488.600281788836
_Mi trema un poco
il_.	1185.278999462763
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	1767.7163307171058
A thrush.	592.3640888758189
A
throstle.	592.3640888758189
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	1699.933419950664
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face.	1039.4186047713413
Greyish over
the ears.	991.7417071162072
_Madame_: smiling.	592.3640888758189
I smiled back.	946.4336915828404
A smile goes a long way.	1197.3763227536033
Only politeness perhaps.	946.4336915828404
Nice fellow.	592.3640888758189
Who knows is that true about the
woman he keeps?	1692.0107467929245
Not pleasant for the wife.	895.4987060413862
Yet they say, who was it
told me, there is no carnal.	1167.79479137281
You would imagine that would get played
out pretty quick.	1823.8195711410742
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
a pound of rumpsteak.	1313.9133109369188
What is this she was?	674.1470775967878
Barmaid in Jury’s.	592.3640888758189
Or the
Moira, was it?	553.4539466167707
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	592.3640888758189
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	364.8106161704509
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his
spine.	1272.267110667366
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	841.7913620727163
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
	1584.5712808968135
—The devil break the hasp of your back!
	1547.983740142533
Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as
the carriage passed Gray’s statue.	1361.1851600428902
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	946.4281504293157
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes.	650.6139634360579
He caressed his beard, adding:
	1376.85051431677
—Well, nearly all of us.	828.4365869033462
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.	1596.976996041782
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and
the son.	1259.3650355217833
—About the boatman?	946.4203558902273
Mr Power asked.	592.3640888758189
Isn’t it awfully good?	878.3990435071662
—What is that?	397.770905500622
Mr Dedalus asked.	592.3640888758189
I didn’t hear it.	812.2947163121236
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were
both.....	1004.6291588993573
Mr Dedalus asked.	592.3640888758189
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	904.2361366039728
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown.....	1285.8872401588578
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	592.3640888758189
I wish to Christ he did!
	574.1771892192853
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	1584.5898924541086
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	1081.9955542357588
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
	1196.2973834972966
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	1446.9084873149159
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	809.5723909493595
Is he dead?	946.4336915828404
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	592.3640888758189
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive.	1495.4820301915402
Half the town was there.	1040.5714564669443
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
But the funny part is.....	1376.861144421135
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son’s life.	1407.592739156929
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.	903.6380540088802
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	592.3640888758189
Like a hero.	946.4304040663756
A silver florin.	946.4336915828404
—Isn’t it awfully good?	878.3990435071662
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	565.3243438224622
Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	1364.439474275382
Nelson’s pillar.	647.1751766753763
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
	661.0938791066782
—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	1039.3395049382075
Mr Dedalus sighed.	592.3640888758189
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.	1462.5470076304507
Many a good one he told himself.	1157.030158215331
—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers.	979.347161158918
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.	1122.6170242301616
He’s gone from us.	1040.6387251357673
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	1191.9754779935251
He went
very suddenly.	1196.3022706333559
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
He tapped his chest sadly.	1376.8378633198702
Cure for a red nose.	1020.1514700612552
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	1699.8778258485852
A lot of money he spent
colouring it.	1699.9651816126084
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	1413.7690644242828
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	1060.498682225433
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	1111.8868016345948
—No suffering, he said.	457.04336643229624
A moment and all is over.	1512.1379065123986
Like dying in sleep.	899.57658219787
Dead side of the street this.	884.6894998118847
Dull business by day, land agents,
temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college,
Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	1449.0741603940626
Some reason.	592.3640888758189
Sun or
wind.	946.4336915828404
At night too.	946.4292464214541
Chummies and slaveys.	946.4336915828404
Under the patronage of the
late Father Mathew.	806.5026505584815
Foundation stone for Parnell.	592.3640888758189
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
galloping.	1344.9751326725077
A tiny coffin flashed by.	1376.8650244983396
In a hurry to bury.	1376.8466345548823
A mourning
coach.	946.4336915828404
Black for the married.	991.54183017563
Piebald for bachelors.	946.4292464214541
Dun for
a nun.	1196.0290801351646
A child.	592.3640888758189
A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was.	1263.5684089446647
Dwarf’s
body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	1870.6672458318453
Burial friendly society
pays.	1196.3022706333559
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	1547.91757945362
Meant
nothing.	592.3640888758189
Mistake of nature.	556.5784433357392
If it’s healthy it’s from the mother.	1496.533006445813
If
not from the man.	1095.6617903130236
Better luck next time.	773.2868893209346
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
It’s well out of it.	456.5191557484409
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	1109.9460404267898
Rattle his
bones.	737.2943990675084
Only a pauper.	946.4336915828404
Nobody owns.	592.3640888758189
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	729.9892949492313
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
life.	1153.8690695412085
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	1045.6198887866067
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	979.5198120709452
We
must take a charitable view of it.	1150.2769587178618
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	980.0661035140733
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	860.4447662177087
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	1512.1271374363957
Martin Cunningham’s
large eyes.	770.2827166624523
Looking away now.	946.4292464214541
Sympathetic human man he is.	717.0827851915423
Like Shakespeare’s face.	565.3043649584574
Always a good word to say.	807.8776343003835
They have no mercy
on that here or infanticide.	1767.7086560839248
Refuse christian burial.	946.4336915828404
They used to
drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	1626.1169711722252
As if it wasn’t
broken already.	1218.7167711777993
Found in the
riverbed clutching rushes.	1512.6717049559772
He looked at me.	666.1632969460726
And that awful drunkard of
a wife of his.	1264.2609886390326
Setting up house for her time after time and then
pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	1568.257875396981
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	1312.1864508765068
Monday
morning.	592.3640888758189
Start afresh.	592.3640888758189
Shoulder to the wheel.	821.8491681249812
Lord, she must have
looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	1078.1051063918835
Drunk about
the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.	946.4205708463261
And they call me the jewel of Asia,
	822.5277700467918
Of Asia,
	592.3640888758189
The geisha.	592.3640888758189
He looked away from me.	1001.2483565843901
He knows.	592.3640888758189
Rattle his bones.	737.2943990675084
That afternoon of the inquest.	1375.9985029851944
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	677.025773423979
The
room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	1299.9046469357409
Stuffy it was.	507.29936491769877
Sunlight
through the slats of the Venetian blind.	1003.3792778274774
The coroner’s sunlit ears, big
and hairy.	1700.0678893036218
Boots giving evidence.	946.4336915828404
Thought he was asleep first.	1377.0168896241353
Then saw
like yellow streaks on his face.	1090.1498941337873
Had slipped down to the foot of the
bed.	470.59543285875185
Verdict: overdose.	592.3640888758189
Death by misadventure.	946.4336915828404
The letter.	592.3640888758189
For my son
Leopold.	592.3640888758189
No more pain.	946.4336915828404
Wake no more.	474.37738287082186
Nobody owns.	592.3640888758189
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	885.1534237904042
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	784.6682711754816
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	955.1450408103393
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
That will be a great race tomorrow
in Germany.	980.2249942984635
The Gordon Bennett.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
That will be worth seeing, faith.	1512.0879788456023
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	1481.4040302212354
Has
anybody here seen Kelly?	675.4898473128194
Kay ee double ell wy.	1185.278999462763
He left me on my ownio.	917.628142158353
Pirouette! The
_Mater Misericordiae_.	592.3640888758189
Eccles street.	592.3640888758189
My house down there.	773.2840755112269
Big place.	592.3640888758189
Ward for incurables there.	1196.3022706333559
Very encouraging.	592.3640888758189
Our Lady’s Hospice for the
dying.	714.4108955997242
Deadhouse handy underneath.	946.4336915828404
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	592.3640888758189
They
look terrible the women.	1185.2614571831232
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
spoon.	1691.6548373699297
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	1555.2108804324682
Nice young student
that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	1795.7069354502944
He’s gone over to the
lying-in hospital they told me.	1181.1928321831044
From one extreme to the other.	762.922926164729
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	1616.8007634552453
—What’s wrong now?	1196.294939936755
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups.	2148.85537367575
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
fear.	1871.0293894283081
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.	592.3640888758189
—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	1795.6155906135923
Huuuh! out of that!
	364.6820984881711
Thursday, of course.	440.48149466315135
Tomorrow is killing day.	1196.3022706333559
Cuffe sold
them about twentyseven quid each.	1616.8195509831073
For Liverpool probably.	592.3640888758189
Roastbeef for
old England.	592.3640888758189
They buy up all the juicy ones.	1259.9627112474989
And then the fifth quarter
lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	1946.0182556106201
Comes to a big thing in a
year.	1547.3317955094615
Dead meat trade.	946.4336915828404
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
the train at Clonsilla.	1532.4986839606056
The carriage moved on through the drove.	1373.5750207167807
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	1486.2782802864008
All those animals could be taken
in trucks down to the boats.	1500.1250253257326
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	946.3780784710601
Quite
right.	592.3640888758189
They ought to.	737.3511669969524
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	1073.3106105986708
Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
and all.	1701.505780378917
Don’t you see what I mean?	667.2583496837731
—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	1039.3273009062514
Pullman car and saloon
diningroom.	1376.8301013573916
—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	706.1578209475638
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	724.107029758722
Wouldn’t it be more decent
than galloping two abreast?	1692.2075916624055
—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	870.9144156810847
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when
the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.	1185.1354024851512
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road.	1259.8600440756063
—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	643.0285300715253
Gordon Bennett cup.	592.3640888758189
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	706.1578209475638
Bom! Upset.	592.3640888758189
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	888.0201979917028
Burst open.	592.3640888758189
Paddy
Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too
large for him.	1564.3457206190926
Red face: grey now.	1196.3022706333559
Mouth fallen open.	946.4336915828404
Asking what’s up
now.	1040.7733824688034
Looks horrid open.	946.4336915828404
Then the insides
decompose quickly.	1376.861144421135
Much better to close up all the orifices.	1366.7566882055817
Yes, also.	592.3640888758189
With wax.	592.3640888758189
The sphincter loose.	946.4336915828404
Seal up all.	946.4487281972517
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	1029.7081697389845
Dunphy’s corner.	647.1803640266236
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	1616.8203985630337
A
pause by the wayside.	1376.294319262233
Tiptop position for a pub.	1185.079154346163
Expect we’ll pull up
here on the way back to drink his health.	1788.1547818409201
Pass round the consolation.	1196.2625468958481
Elixir of life.	423.53599958878664
But suppose now it did happen.	1512.1380890374471
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in
the knocking about?	1623.7792905658162
He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose.	822.3057193672612
Depends on
where.	946.4336915828404
The circulation stops.	946.4336915828404
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	1474.8164259358646
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	1632.8466119626667
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	795.3106600726599
An empty hearse trotted
by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	1747.5117115970304
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	943.5733051792803
A man stood on his dropping
barge, between clamps of turf.	1747.816305147234
On the towpath by the lock a
slacktethered horse.	1767.3534714820953
Aboard of the _Bugabu._
	592.3640888758189
Their eyes watched him.	1196.2980565823646
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on
his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	1847.5548802091243
Athlone, Mullingar,
Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	1057.806382834836
Or
cycle down.	946.4336915828404
Hire some old crock, safety.	1376.8456234328735
Wren had one the other day at
the auction but a lady’s.	1363.6656372899129
Developing waterways.	592.3640888758189
James M’Cann’s hobby to
row me o’er the ferry.	1324.1814507947329
Cheaper transit.	592.3640888758189
By easy stages.	946.4336915828404
Camping out.	592.3640888758189
Also hearses.	592.3640888758189
To heaven by water.	1196.2938425462191
Perhaps I will without
writing.	1039.41860477134
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	660.7395580241673
Dropping down lock by
lock to Dublin.	1082.0154678135393
With turf from the midland bogs.	1511.5492162764735
He lifted his
brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	1106.4002271859677
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	724.1084873131331
Near it now.	507.19202448485635
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	743.0014081037817
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
—How is that?	397.770905500622
Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
Left him weeping, I suppose?	592.3640888758189
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	1039.4268154861727
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	885.1534237904042
The stonecutter’s yard on the right.	906.2688419337694
Last lap.	592.3640888758189
Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
knelt in grief, pointing.	2083.5035133386523
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	1196.2980565823646
In white silence:
appealing.	1196.3022706333559
The best obtainable.	946.4336915828404
Dennany, monumental builder
and sculptor.	1376.8650244983396
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat,
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
yawning boot.	1567.6736149440494
After life’s journey.	1196.2896282679212
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	1531.718623704364
Mr Power pointed.	592.3640888758189
—That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	620.2776277909412
The last house.	946.4336915828404
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
A gruesome case.	946.4336915828404
Seymour Bushe got him off.	1039.3820502985354
Murdered his brother.	946.4025739938797
Or so they said.	991.9502256048318
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	841.8010631470129
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	592.3640888758189
That’s the maxim of the
law.	1034.9650567830315
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
person to be wrongfully condemned.	1856.3669394142855
They looked.	592.3640888758189
Murderer’s ground.	737.2943990675084
It passed darkly.	946.4336915828404
Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden.	1196.3022706333559
Whole place gone to hell.	1376.850270343966
Wrongfully
condemned.	592.3640888758189
The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.	1278.8346166149972
They love reading about it.	1001.2348233755326
Man’s head found in a garden.	1233.9030802636523
Her clothing
consisted of.	1196.2980565823661
How she met her death.	1376.8339835558472
Recent outrage.	592.3640888758189
The weapon used.	946.4336915828404
Murderer is still at large.	1376.8417438836182
A shoelace.	592.3640888758189
The body to be exhumed.	1376.7392670535576
Murder will out.	946.4336915828404
Cramped in this carriage.	1196.2357957942293
She mightn’t like me to come that way without
letting her know.	1632.9369980378442
Must be careful about women.	1376.8533842206493
Catch them once with
their pants down.	1616.7268402919715
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	1018.0620834469613
Dark poplars,
rare white forms.	1376.861144421135
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	1616.6967385836845
Martin Cunningham put
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
his knee.	1367.4617631350804
He stepped out.	946.4292464214541
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	1822.2406917797346
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
still held.	1413.9948272215834
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	1512.1246122890575
It’s all the same.	503.0030097976058
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	1700.0648950022403
Pomp of death.	593.5089631274839
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
fruit.	1873.375673187488
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	1349.3192457352345
Who ate them?	946.4336915828404
Mourners coming out.	737.3160249205486
He followed his companions.	1196.2896284392518
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them.	728.0334179971902
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
out the two wreaths.	1329.053558401662
He handed one to the boy.	845.8694918881777
Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?	1548.0523971819682
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block.	1823.7574771179118
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	1452.6785961401417
Coffin now.	592.3640888758189
Got here before us, dead as he is.	1042.4009776253874
Horse looking round at
it with his plume skeowways.	1480.8058303656553
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,
pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	1721.4986151029325
Do they know what they cart out
here every day?	1555.3198375803402
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	1393.1772225844566
Then Mount
Jerome for the protestants.	946.1489751829962
Funerals all over the world everywhere
every minute.	1080.1545501167855
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	1452.2974190170276
Thousands every hour.	946.4336915828404
Too many in the world.	446.95085722985556
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	979.8711856639642
Leanjawed harpy,
hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	1570.0036727901506
Girl’s face stained with dirt
and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to
cry.	1885.6967474147045
Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.	1512.123767591278
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	1410.3122835771221
So
much dead weight.	1196.3022706333559
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	1118.9013652224821
First
the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	1371.5475169096364
Corny Kelleher and the boy
followed with their wreaths.	1511.5052108286952
Who is that beside them?	1185.256064333317
Ah, the
brother-in-law.	592.8298920119086
All walked after.	946.4336915828404
Martin Cunningham whispered:
	592.3640888758189
—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	1512.1636583013387
How so?	592.3640888758189
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	724.1084873131331
Had the
Queen’s hotel in Ennis.	724.1019585049161
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	740.2915924237868
—O God! Mr Power whispered.	592.3640888758189
First I heard of it.	556.3600600636311
Poisoned himself?	592.3640888758189
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards the cardinal’s mausoleum.	1823.9134571307325
—Was he insured?	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	592.3640888758189
But the policy was heavily
mortgaged.	1512.1317147529485
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	892.627550817915
—How many children did he leave?	1512.0634286384332
Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.	1083.6046439877496
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	615.2681500540496
Five young children.	946.4336915828404
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	894.4571070107512
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	592.3640888758189
Has the laugh at him now.	1056.8674651604204
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	1512.1746277249927
She had
outlived him.	1196.3022706333559
Lost her husband.	946.4057149613244
More dead for her than for me.	1145.485953022667
One must
outlive the other.	859.5225189886438
Wise men say.	946.4336915828404
Condole with her.	946.2057797167361
Your terrible loss.	946.4336915828404
I hope you’ll soon follow
him.	1452.709541622654
For Hindu widows only.	841.8114424048898
She would marry another.	1196.2980565823661
Yet who
knows after.	1196.2852750338998
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	1626.3844326752237
Drawn on
a guncarriage.	1195.955596641869
Victoria and Albert.	592.3640888758189
Frogmore memorial mourning.	946.4336915828404
But in
the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	1701.1225554648
Vain in her heart of
hearts.	1250.2628241969612
All for a shadow.	991.763805120748
Consort not even a king.	943.5453270137515
Her son was the
substance.	1376.6373784653654
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
waiting.	1837.021024680677
It never comes.	946.4292464214541
One must go first: alone, under the ground:
and lie no more in her warm bed.	1771.7587991636817
—How are you, Simon?	592.3640888758189
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	1196.2994612643795
Haven’t
seen you for a month of Sundays.	1094.9791985980332
—Never better.	592.3640888758189
How are all in Cork’s own town?	913.8012650207772
Same old six and eightpence.	1185.2883354027651
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	592.3640888758189
—And how is Dick, the solid man?	885.1516420694329
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	706.6677034197813
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	903.1065591627124
Dick Tivy bald?	592.3640888758189
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead.	987.8370791976074
A few bob a skull.	812.2960467337127
Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up.	1647.4587038801585
—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	748.7545201171381
Is that the eldest boy in front?	1452.5474891546296
John Henry Menton is
behind.	784.6746171349943
He put down his name for a quid.	1342.2813643632842
—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	841.8114424048898
I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job.	945.2092504271718
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	712.9949272565091
—How did he lose it?	1185.2072189874589
Ned Lambert asked.	592.3640888758189
Liquor, what?	592.3640888758189
—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	895.0496064336141
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	900.4808760023392
Mr Bloom stood
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	1701.5191434877595
Poor boy! Was
he there when the father?	980.2826373349243
Both unconscious.	592.3640888758189
Lighten up at the last
moment and recognise for the last time.	914.7434206241735
All he might have done.	1001.2293915731461
I owe
three shillings to O’Grady.	885.1467607468725
The mutes bore the
coffin into the chapel.	1547.8913820461744
Which end is his head?	859.4817862656183
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light.	1637.3662442440511
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners.	2026.5746212538097
Always in front of us.	663.1768519477918
Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	1607.6434562532695
The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	1182.6439260902835
Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	1751.033791892832
He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	1885.7807502075416
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door.	1640.299436057693
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with
one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s
belly.	1869.5431609904072
Who’ll read the book?	943.5365682944519
I, said the rook.	1196.2601269362265
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
with a fluent croak.	1474.883991359745
Father Coffey.	592.3640888758189
I knew his name was like a coffin.	1237.4093034599077
_Dominenamine._ Bully
about the muzzle he looks.	1196.1527676809887
Bosses the show.	593.5229010712899
Muscular christian.	592.3640888758189
Woe
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	1767.7328601622805
Thou art Peter.	592.3640888758189
Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	1275.1656240712725
With a belly on
him like a poisoned pup.	1134.22331638367
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	1512.1022617423669
Hhhn:
burst sideways.	946.4292464214541
_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._
	1039.4186047713413
Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	1449.01519898015
Requiem
mass.	592.3640888758189
Blackedged notepaper.	592.3640888758189
Chilly place this.	946.4336915828404
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning
in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	1690.3021807832442
Eyes of a
toad too.	1375.9366798746296
What swells him up that way?	920.5948607301208
Molly gets swelled after
cabbage.	1376.861144421135
Air of the place maybe.	1039.9516428037957
Looks full up of bad gas.	1177.973528252782
Must be an
infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	1471.9404526779244
Butchers, for instance: they
get like raw beefsteaks.	1700.0424551189803
Who was telling me?	502.2261043177113
Mervyn Browne.	592.3640888758189
Down in the
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn
it.	1631.6129349761643
One whiff of that and you’re a goner.	1249.8632161416222
My kneecap is hurting me.	1376.8650244983396
That’s better.	946.4248011905848
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s
bucket and shook it over the coffin.	1112.8390231824246
Then he walked to the other end
and shook it again.	1297.2202417833057
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	702.819304435614
As
you were before you rested.	1512.063275901422
It’s all written down: he has to do it.	1121.3234927655203
_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._
	1426.1131295590228
The server piped the answers in the treble.	1474.6165276862935
I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants.	1182.1670198036904
Up to fifteen or so.	1376.856415696844
After that, of course
...	452.6956672111261
Holy water that was, I expect.	748.7545201171381
Shaking sleep out of it.	410.93620811590466
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	1047.4539794530335
Every mortal day
a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
with little sparrows’ breasts.	2168.332307453653
All the year round he prayed the same
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	1909.8589339732812
On Dignam
now.	592.3640888758189
Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	1189.6315675352846
Says that over
everybody.	1196.3022706333559
Tiresome kind of a job.	632.1250276206289
But he has to say something.	1023.4310611234313
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	1572.201615599877
Corny
Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	1884.0578960023502
Corny
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law.	1154.5373908059487
All
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	1214.8968213173669
Mr Bloom
came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	1200.9243866538395
He gazed gravely at
the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	1498.765184577945
The metal
wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	2046.3764874988315
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	1254.0575256472084
Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.	1196.3001929036311
—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	692.9364433290582
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	1188.262636051977
—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’.	850.7698029483745
But
his heart is buried in Rome.	1081.9903999802343
How many broken hearts are buried here,
Simon!
	1196.3022706333559
—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	809.5711234688683
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	724.1011992741065
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.	1696.0143331615068
Mr Power took his arm.	785.5527198957969
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	852.5231794200212
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.	1787.5251091816594
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	748.7545201171381
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	989.6664647310838
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	1039.3827465883091
I suppose we can
do so too.	1287.7973667979522
We are the last.	698.9679983318191
They covered their heads.	991.9649674638666
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?	1212.6690284462693
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	1584.9957943424606
Secret
eyes, secretsearching.	946.4336915828404
Mason, I think: not sure.	894.7896081447772
Beside him again.	737.2943990675084
We
are the last.	698.9679983318191
In the same boat.	822.5184062554298
Hope he’ll say something else.	1512.0917567000236
Mr Kernan added:
	592.3640888758189
—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
impressive I must say.	820.1103149636656
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	1039.41860477134
The language of course was another thing.	1616.9164445171548
Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
	894.7816845637145
—_I am the resurrection and the life_.	1304.6280499023471
That touches a man’s inmost
heart.	1175.9975678062826
—It does, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
with his toes to the daisies?	1763.4611822994798
No touching that.	946.4336915828404
Seat of the affections.	1195.3654486092223
Broken heart.	592.3640888758189
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
every day.	1673.7741674482318
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	1243.2789758663253
Lots of
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	1767.7175336640455
Old rusty pumps: damn
the thing else.	1172.777500505383
The resurrection and the life.	1184.4758778847156
Once you are dead you
are dead.	1305.2820740927032
That last day idea.	1196.2896282679212
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	1120.5057355717277
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	1112.8358572224695
Get up! Last
day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and
the rest of his traps.	1237.429201690971
Find damn all of himself that morning.	1452.7353530360888
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	1249.9374054630632
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	1196.3022706333559
Troy
measure.	592.3640888758189
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	1426.0717322540074
—Everything went off A1, he said.	394.2307041882751
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	1547.9745531530325
Policeman’s shoulders.	737.2874734175336
With
your tooraloom tooraloom.	843.0681578707729
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	592.8616386650593
Corny Kelleher said.	592.3640888758189
Mr Kernan assured him.	841.8114424048898
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	1003.507741466868
John Henry Menton asked.	592.3640888758189
I
know his face.	578.8702199342855
Ned Lambert glanced back.	841.8084770704346
—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
soprano.	819.3736782147018
She’s his wife.	803.3653912145837
—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	534.4585853173993
I haven’t seen her for some
time.	1077.5665419779546
She was a finelooking woman.	1376.574856495803
I danced with her, wait, fifteen
seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.	1196.2421683479388
And a good
armful she was.	1070.4604821978762
He looked behind through the others.	1334.3370332639147
—What is he?	416.2664053616629
he asked.	168.4727106542555
What does he do?	1196.268556242319
Wasn’t he in the stationery
line?	1305.6553146080369
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	1191.2848901065074
Ned Lambert smiled.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s.	656.4830782211872
A traveller for blottingpaper.	1196.2980565823646
—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for?	1090.3075830442997
She had plenty of game in her then.	1474.136897335774
He does some canvassing for ads.	1334.6363643943644
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.	1089.3611673030114
The barrow turned into a side lane.	1616.740270155691
A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage.	1686.9352792601544
The gravediggers touched their caps.	1376.8572643548641
—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	724.1084873131331
He never forgets a friend.	1376.8758696595755
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence.	1139.5378829695892
Mr Dedalus said:
	592.3640888758189
—I am come to pay you another visit.	1700.027495775861
—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	1030.1786303711908
I don’t want
your custom at all.	861.2911083021079
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	984.2718118005708
—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	1149.0422762125443
The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	2054.7222785655717
—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	1741.3451937703674
They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	946.6450507976112
After
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	1633.180880714475
One of the
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	1195.8469740938444
The other drunk was
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	1450.4694242088365
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	1444.8057915250467
He
resumed:
	592.3640888758189
—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
the man_, says he.	1097.926248100647
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	1106.4970394858146
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
he walked.	1528.4006774152433
—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	946.176883826697
—I know, Hynes said.	592.3640888758189
I know that.	556.5634395353443
—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	841.7781066335755
It’s pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	1283.6609027104803
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.	1426.0955463601451
All want to be on
good terms with him.	937.6090454342428
Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.	841.8114424048898
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	1353.6621867198508
No passout
checks.	946.4336915828404
_Habeas corpus_.	592.3640888758189
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	1339.7034729691295
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
disturbed me writing to Martha?	1106.3343807313004
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead
letter office.	1302.6069757701948
Be the better of a shave.	1333.8645006805255
Grey sprouting beard.	946.4336915828404
That’s
the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	1747.601224797222
And temper getting cross.	1196.3022706333559
Silver threads among the grey.	1376.7516375444702
Fancy being his wife.	803.3626451189629
Wonder he had the
gumption to propose to any girl.	1375.4919184602659
Come out and live in the graveyard.	1617.1915442638576
Dangle that before her.	1196.2854143471307
It might thrill her first.	1096.1035572745263
Courting death.	592.3640888758189
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	1549.8149828656556
The
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	1071.0158258798103
Gas of graves.	737.2943990675084
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
all.	1527.9949988834435
Women especially are so touchy.	1376.8495037818602
Tell her a ghost story in bed to
make her sleep.	1538.9771352131152
Have you ever seen a ghost?	1334.626999544503
Well, I have.	592.3640888758189
It was a
pitchdark night.	1376.574856495803
Still they’d
kiss all right if properly keyed up.	1823.8710685770116
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	592.3640888758189
Learn anything if taken young.	1376.861144421135
You might pick up a young widow here.	1547.9905424731958
Men like that.	360.2611213334049
Love among the tombstones.	1196.207525260961
Spice of pleasure.	737.2840105113547
In
the midst of death we are in life.	1282.8356532621551
Both ends meet.	737.2943990675084
Tantalising for the
poor dead.	1376.3003486949785
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	1616.03601741731
Gnawing their
vitals.	946.4336915828404
Desire to grig people.	1196.3022706333559
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	740.3176338454472
Eight children he has anyway.	1376.7771961164
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
after field.	1753.2678911218586
Holy fields.	592.3640888758189
More room if they buried them standing.	1616.7984909778734
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t.	959.6781589261558
His head might come up some
day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	1856.408393454568
All honeycombed
the ground must be: oblong cells.	1699.9856502100492
And very neat he keeps it too: trim
grass and edgings.	1747.874526327521
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	592.3640888758189
Well, so
it is.	377.558126953599
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	1512.0166203993042
Chinese cemeteries with giant
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	1208.2584839422093
The Botanic
Gardens are just over there.	919.3695638137527
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives
new life.	1377.5427565288905
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	1823.8523131521233
Every man his price.	1196.2980565823646
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
invaluable for fruit garden.	1823.8631548295793
A bargain.	592.3640888758189
By carcass of William
Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds
thirteen and six.	967.5443642557864
With thanks.	592.3640888758189
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails.	1946.0912777779095
Turning green and pink decomposing.	1376.8456234328735
Rot
quick in damp earth.	1376.861144421135
The lean old ones tougher.	1376.853384062898
Then a kind of a
tallowy kind of a cheesy.	794.0407561396385
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing
out of them.	1192.4958005812516
Then dried up.	946.4336915828404
Of course the cells or whatever
they are go on living.	1512.2109809567
Changing about.	592.3640888758189
Live for ever practically.	1196.2982909212492
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	1616.8008712936867
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	1279.5557354039722
Soil must be simply
swirling with them.	1373.6744291613136
Your head it simply swurls.	719.6978809299593
Those pretty little
seaside gurls.	1376.861144421135
He looks cheerful enough over it.	1055.9823410421282
Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first.	1836.949779128852
Wonder how he looks at
life.	1334.5870297236934
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	1414.4529254528786
The one
about the bulletin.	1095.899033275866
Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m.	724.7082995459982
this morning.	527.2852186720991
11
p.m.	489.3910048495618
(closing time).	2415.961850251123
Not arrived yet.	946.4336915828404
The dead themselves the
men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s
in fashion.	1681.3952054859196
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	1692.2177606527378
Keep
out the damp.	1196.1052319444154
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	1354.1942866413349
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	592.3640888758189
Shows the profound knowledge of the human
heart.	1326.9874085663273
Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least.	1747.7090378356306
_De mortuis
nil nisi prius_.	1376.8650244983396
Go out of mourning first.	1377.8663394255227
Hard to imagine his funeral.	1376.8582748338406
Seems a sort of a joke.	749.6444339649893
Read your own obituary notice they say you live
longer.	1627.302125927993
Gives you second wind.	1196.3022706333559
New lease of life.	542.755318270689
—How many have you for tomorrow?	1177.970210038646
the caretaker asked.	1419.2935669820604
—Two, Corny Kelleher said.	592.3640888758189
Half ten and eleven.	991.9614733091228
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	977.368294275105
The barrow had ceased to
trundle.	1334.6363642669342
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
stepping with care round the graves.	1694.7247476345508
The gravediggers bore the coffin
and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	1687.3227218245595
Burying him.	592.3640888758189
We come to bury Cæsar.	784.6571412358488
His ides of March or June.	592.3640888758189
He
doesn’t know who is here nor care.	1262.4746148728045
Now who is that lankylooking galoot
over there in the macintosh?	1132.209326626428
Now who is he I’d like to know?	581.3088810166411
Now I’d
give a trifle to know who he is.	891.9116722227984
Always someone turns up you never
dreamt of.	1700.0634026084952
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	1312.5153641042016
Yes, he
could.	737.2628903585786
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though
he could dig his own grave.	1652.173797924182
We all do.	946.4203558902273
Only man buries.	946.4336915828404
No, ants too.	946.4336915828404
First thing strikes anybody.	1196.3022706333559
Bury the dead.	507.1826290744173
Say Robinson Crusoe was
true to life.	972.1873614209932
Well then Friday buried him.	675.4898473128194
Every Friday buries a
Thursday if you come to look at it.	699.8100132987648
O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
	592.3640888758189
How could you possibly do so?	1334.625121908896
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	1220.1829302091933
When you think of
them all it does seem a waste of wood.	1385.7981527879126
All gnawed through.	946.4336915828404
They could
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
way.	1456.409334221372
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.	1946.5489828299687
They’re so particular.	1196.3022706333559
Lay me in my native earth.	1197.3734884678754
Bit of clay from the
holy land.	1616.2402705914083
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
coffin.	1652.8521667386963
I see what it means.	943.6024153407251
To protect him as long as possible
even in the earth.	939.6647510724412
The Irishman’s house is his coffin.	959.40772384684
Embalming in
catacombs, mummies the same idea.	1616.7813492950656
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	1309.8009472145286
I’m thirteen.	946.4336915828404
The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	998.1118989468207
Death’s number.	946.4336915828404
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	1427.7526482566782
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	1376.8621549029606
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	946.3633281438017
Tinge of purple.	946.4292464214541
I had
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	993.5221461635402
Dressy fellow he
was once.	1376.9897256076295
Used to change three suits in the day.	1067.6125345889654
Must get that grey
suit of mine turned by Mesias.	1376.8267271912791
It’s dyed.	946.4336915828404
His wife I forgot he’s
not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
him.	1295.1289381951026
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
gravetrestles.	1630.0434088670381
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	1547.971907257061
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	1452.6636942850384
Far away a donkey brayed.	1376.8543947173234
No such ass.	946.4336915828404
Never see a dead one, they
say.	1145.5016866077842
Shame of death.	593.5089631274839
They hide.	592.3640888758189
Also poor papa went away.	1376.8581599403306
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	1686.4533343791877
The
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
the black open space.	1652.8974097661855
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
caretaker.	1426.068014762137
Weighing them up perhaps to see which
will go next.	1692.2934218970822
Well, it is a long rest.	931.9294848719926
Feel no more.	474.37738287082186
It’s the moment
you feel.	1250.2618891191325
Must be damned unpleasant.	1196.3085546720251
Can’t believe it at first.	1056.87619491866
Wait, I wanted to.	697.9870155956286
I
haven’t yet.	1196.3043407266393
Then darkened deathchamber.	946.4336915828404
Light they want.	946.4246543296013
Whispering
around you.	946.4336915828404
Would you like to see a priest?	761.2644384102563
Then rambling and
wandering.	1196.3022706333559
Delirium all you hid all your life.	1616.793514202998
The death struggle.	946.4336915828404
His
sleep is not natural.	1376.8016691180824
Press his lower eyelid.	1196.2980565823646
Watching is his nose
pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	2026.3038868109468
Pull the
pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed.	1493.522609923637
Devil in
that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman.	1443.2438206534275
Dying to embrace
her in his shirt.	1109.004555960398
Last act of _Lucia.	592.3640888758189
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	1039.41860477134
Bam! He expires.	592.3640888758189
Gone at last.	737.2788882654531
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	1548.0416257782767
Don’t forget to pray for him.	846.5660011367177
Remember him in your prayers.	1376.823239194285
Even
Parnell.	592.3640888758189
Ivy day dying out.	1196.3022706333559
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one
after the other.	1510.2275783096168
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	982.005534488429
Hoping you’re well and
not in hell.	1409.642250389173
Nice change of air.	991.9379220649753
Out of the fryingpan of life into the
fire of purgatory.	1747.248774606036
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	1301.6746099868294
They say you do
when you shiver in the sun.	1133.400842150808
Someone walking over it.	578.8972340510792
Callboy’s warning.	946.4336915828404
Near you.	592.3640888758189
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	692.5032933782139
Mamma,
poor mamma, and little Rudy.	946.4292463762724
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
on the coffin.	1760.882621642819
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	835.3921108527005
And if he was alive all
the time?	662.6115565488461
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
course.	980.9533524941231
Of course he is dead.	773.1029441321889
Monday he died.	737.2675970770078
They ought to have some
law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a
telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	1556.8311053775437
Flag of
distress.	946.4336915828404
Three days.	592.3640888758189
Rather long to keep them in summer.	1189.4098358804792
Just as well
to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.	1281.9150586853864
The clay fell softer.	1196.3022706333559
Begin to be forgotten.	1196.174117522858
Out of sight, out of mind.	1335.4388796534665
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	1037.5145022302486
Had enough of
it.	547.7038865386936
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
without show.	1701.5802169967674
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
its way deftly through the maze of graves.	1339.9905022645773
Quietly, sure of his ground,
he traversed the dismal fields.	1691.9050124836147
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	1373.735152028403
Ah, the names.	946.4248011905848
But he
knows them all.	701.7410764529573
No: coming to me.	596.9451138715559
—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	1149.6523042528868
What is your
christian name?	1376.8339829248023
I’m not sure.	991.9726471974104
—L, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too.	798.355825244678
He
asked me to.	581.4445488961196
—Charley, Hynes said writing.	841.8114424048898
I know.	592.3640888758189
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	530.1162884756238
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	1145.5351622254705
Good
idea a postmortem for doctors.	1512.138816961438
Find out what they imagine they know.	1373.762682198018
He
died of a Tuesday.	784.667983257263
Got the run.	946.4203558902273
That was why he asked me to.	852.709343605967
O well, does
no harm.	943.592500449238
I saw to that, M’Coy.	660.8681600265427
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	1376.8495037818602
Leave
him under an obligation: costs nothing.	1616.8162963626678
—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
over there in the...	799.6653389392606
He looked around.	946.4336915828404
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Where is he now?	676.4780872793324
—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	784.6746171349943
I don’t know who he is.	468.44871485230505
Is that his
name?	729.455785414867
He moved away, looking about him.	1197.4247558613874
—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	1082.0132898299282
I say, Hynes!
	592.3640888758189
Didn’t hear.	593.5236270036847
Where has he disappeared to?	1185.27318902619
Not a sign.	737.2883752415042
Well of all
the.	529.2554874587587
Has anybody here seen?	991.9754506693862
Kay ee double ell.	991.9789448889109
Become invisible.	592.3640888758189
Good
Lord, what became of him?	684.5472904508366
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	1192.036230297363
—O, excuse me!
	556.5777625845743
He stepped aside nimbly.	1196.2980565823646
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	1278.4384764000454
It rose.	592.3640888758189
Nearly over.	592.3640888758189
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
their spades.	1872.9623558546132
All uncovered again for a few instants.	1111.7384571770274
The boy propped
his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump.	1486.0921126594476
The
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
the barrow.	1873.2765337382723
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	1496.4172250943766
One
bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	1910.917948156571
One, leaving his
mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	1946.111910791753
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	1699.852328306437
His navelcord.	592.3640888758189
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	1270.44748355791
Thanks in silence.	647.1812560548422
Sorry, sir: trouble.	946.4336915828404
I know that.	556.5634395353443
For
yourselves just.	946.4336915828404
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	2021.82541977697
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said.	1048.711227536701
We have time.	946.4336915828404
—Let us, Mr Power said.	592.3640888758189
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	1165.3316558988279
With awe Mr
Power’s blank voice spoke:
	913.8157508120638
—Some say he is not in that grave at all.	1208.1559534638516
That the coffin was filled
with stones.	1616.7983677696136
That one day he will come again.	1305.2399475386314
Hynes shook his head.	467.7954373007114
—Parnell will never come again, he said.	838.2784813564969
He’s there, all that was
mortal of him.	1218.4355379518904
Peace to his ashes.	1195.9416686333311
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
old Ireland’s hearts and hands.	1767.7624262082982
More sensible to spend the money on
some charity for the living.	1795.3691405183688
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	900.3500764046893
Does
anybody really?	946.4336915828404
Plant him and have done with him.	826.9903177438355
Like down a
coalshoot.	1196.272770789106
Then lump them together to save time.	1616.8106349981201
All souls’ day.	946.4336915828404
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave.	1322.5692174622127
Ten shillings for the gardener.	1376.375752837004
He
keeps it free of weeds.	1512.1281636973065
Old man himself.	946.4336915828404
Bent down double with his
shears clipping.	1616.4794768225677
Near death’s door.	1196.2812001841874
Who passed away.	946.4336915828404
Who departed this
life.	991.9754506878854
As if they did it of their own accord.	1376.9326077509706
Got the shove, all of
them.	749.6912131855097
Who kicked the bucket.	581.5025575258752
More interesting if they told you what
they were.	1767.5720899255807
So and So, wheelwright.	592.3640888758189
I paid
five shillings in the pound.	1305.6782845296998
Or a woman’s with her saucepan.	1202.406061934365
I cooked
good Irish stew.	592.3640888758189
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	1174.9132768205877
Entered into rest
the protestants put it.	1452.722857996903
Old Dr Murren’s.	592.3640888758189
The great physician called him
home.	1512.1158082155926
Well it’s God’s acre for them.	766.602933907145
Nice country residence.	737.2943990675084
Newly
plastered and painted.	1196.3022706333559
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the
_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	1178.8018350694606
Rusty wreaths
hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	1700.0619005235242
Better value that for the money.	989.8940747995536
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	1512.1148839681796
The other gets rather tiresome,
never withering.	1616.8260600451579
Expresses nothing.	592.3640888758189
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	1767.539140035937
Like stuffed.	592.3640888758189
Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	1003.5219735506462
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	605.7026006061539
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	1302.0575932117972
Dead animal even
sadder.	1196.3022706333559
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	1517.1175564387734
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	1082.0317344035927
Heart on his sleeve.	1196.1547663861256
Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	1694.95471126662
Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that.	1548.0974024814957
Seems anything but pleased.	1196.294939936755
Why this
infliction?	946.4336915828404
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
boy.	1368.2719424518116
Apollo that was.	507.2284106919343
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	946.4336915828404
As you are now so once were we.	1548.087141550143
Besides how could you remember everybody?	1334.6195660342341
Eyes, walk, voice.	946.4336915828404
Well, the
voice, yes: gramophone.	1376.961123637152
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
the house.	1053.7481679544976
After dinner on a Sunday.	784.6746171349943
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	1376.8328431619627
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
hellohello amawf krpthsth.	1426.1131295590228
Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face.	1332.3598636986894
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after
fifteen years, say.	1316.3218426948526
For instance some fellow that
died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.	912.9135276634485
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	1039.4156756356856
He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	1699.9769807880703
Some animal.	592.3640888758189
There he
goes.	737.27542522507
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
pebbles.	1420.732083574946
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	1548.057599126559
The grey
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	1683.1908631080948
Good hidingplace for treasure.	1196.3022706333559
Who lives there?	946.4336915828404
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	795.3058567993203
Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he?	1229.1794037774387
Making his rounds.	946.4292464214541
Tail gone now.	946.4292464214541
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	1575.1622309030602
Pick the bones
clean no matter who it was.	1321.2777532853022
Ordinary meat for them.	698.1136495319619
A corpse is meat
gone bad.	1512.138816961438
Well and what’s cheese?	1040.7542906134486
Corpse of milk.	946.4259588536014
I read in that
_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
corpse.	955.5078589535522
Priests dead against it.	991.9824392102742
Devilling for the
other firm.	1040.2941966406688
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	748.7545201171381
Time of the
plague.	821.9111732730395
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	1376.8454952342665
Lethal chamber.	592.3640888758189
Ashes to
ashes.	946.4336915828404
Or bury at sea.	1196.2811996701753
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	795.3170636437331
Eaten by
birds.	946.4336915828404
Earth, fire, water.	946.4336915828404
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	1177.8000233115147
See
your whole life in a flash.	1616.2536080705715
But being brought back to life no.	1452.72774579548
Can’t
bury in the air however.	1092.1432950812637
Wonder does the news
go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	1946.0826059084723
Underground communication.	592.3640888758189
We learned that from them.	1185.2464667108059
Wouldn’t be surprised.	991.9413124383472
Regular square feed
for them.	894.8691367586092
Flies come before he’s well dead.	1373.8532820203302
Got wind of Dignam.	592.3640888758189
They
wouldn’t care about the smell of it.	890.5953444448414
Saltwhite crumbling mush of
corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	1871.0774890473344
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	1616.8843153806504
Back to the world again.	1000.6734695994837
Enough of this place.	991.934662300817
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	1305.2556741820595
Last time I
was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.	784.669376869088
Poor papa too.	946.4336915828404
The love that kills.	1196.294939936755
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I
read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
gravesores.	1754.372662027447
Give you the creeps after a bit.	1067.8166910095706
You will see my ghost after death.	1260.0022086040642
My ghost will haunt you after
death.	1132.135213227294
There is another world after death named hell.	1700.0750230650692
I do not like
that other world she wrote.	701.4853214821926
No more do I.	592.3640888758189
Plenty to see and hear and
feel yet.	1548.1809324938235
Feel live warm beings near you.	1334.6489013698113
Let them sleep in their
maggoty beds.	1616.5988877322873
They are not going to get me this innings.	1054.6206683577911
Warm beds:
warm fullblooded life.	1376.8650244983396
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	1425.9837667290114
Solicitor, I think.	592.3640888758189
I know his face.	578.8702199342855
Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	927.1673912413506
Dignam used to be in his office.	718.4032545495903
Mat Dillon’s long ago.	602.3564553972979
Jolly Mat.	592.3640888758189
Convivial evenings.	592.3640888758189
Cold fowl,
cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	748.7545201171381
Heart of gold really.	1196.287609025839
Yes, Menton.	592.3640888758189
Got
his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
him.	1462.2040164166935
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	1512.107780503435
Why he took such a rooted dislike to
me.	1297.9137319849588
Hate at first sight.	1196.2696538291964
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the
lilactree, laughing.	1106.3463997088381
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are
by.	1557.4729654588948
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	864.3593933165882
Carriage probably.	592.3640888758189
—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	766.5590022471526
They stopped.	592.3640888758189
—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	927.2750430797372
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	1004.928714909858
—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	946.4336915828393
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	1606.212743873043
He clapped the hat on his head
again.	898.4623043779521
—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	631.8875960264857
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	1190.168872841699
—Thank you, he said shortly.	783.5087706396899
They walked on towards the gates.	1334.468390717016
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
few paces so as not to overhear.	1248.3747016416203
Martin laying down the law.	1096.0113597385089
Martin
could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
seeing it.	1856.4459685437548
Oyster eyes.	592.3640888758189
Never mind.	592.3640888758189
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	1360.6017394494938
Get the pull over him that way.	949.3852865420358
Thank you.	592.3640888758189
How grand we are this morning!
	910.4035445563549
IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
	592.3640888758189
Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross.	791.1892791100449
The hoarse Dublin United
Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:
	869.5992956377559
—Rathgar and Terenure!
	592.3640888758189
—Come on, Sandymount Green!
	592.3640888758189
Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a
singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided
parallel.	2054.4529899204535
—Start, Palmerston Park!
	592.3640888758189
THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
	592.3640888758189
Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
polished.	1230.9505575690441
Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion
mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	1070.6163503569367
R., received
loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	1700.0601037414192
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
	592.3640888758189
Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores
and bumped them up on the brewery float.	1234.8587077485013
On the brewery float bumped
dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s
stores.	1485.8465949413542
—There it is, Red Murray said.	592.3640888758189
Alexander Keyes.	592.3640888758189
—Just cut it out, will you?	1031.5567967241718
Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to
the _Telegraph_ office.	790.5135554540302
The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again.	1003.5131356077911
Davy Stephens, minute in
a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out
with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.	1790.2180799504602
Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the
newspaper in four clean strokes.	1689.9277902592862
Scissors and paste.	946.4336915828404
—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
square.	1156.606721256778
—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
his ear, we can do him one.	1275.4430742330019
—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	658.1097178310424
I’ll rub that in.	1376.836478093551
WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
	592.3640888758189
Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:
	1195.981011025952
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.	1141.5141844720872
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels.	841.8114424048898
It passed statelily up the staircase,
steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	1567.568634146575
The broadcloth back
ascended each step: back.	1616.8260600451579
All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
Simon Dedalus says.	1091.967318229573
Welts of flesh behind on him.	901.1980718822934
Fat folds of neck,
fat, neck, fat, neck.	1409.698578465728
—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	1067.4253848266603
Red Murray whispered.	592.3640888758189
The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree.	1106.4192827543147
They always build
one door opposite another for the wind to.	1747.5941993439824
Way in.	592.3640888758189
Way out.	592.3640888758189
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	1512.4893188882554
Mary, Martha.	592.3640888758189
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	1112.4663605479027
—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, Red Murray agreed.	592.3640888758189
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
Saviour.	732.3368572434098
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	1700.0678893036238
Hand on his
heart.	842.9133660121047
In _Martha._
	592.3640888758189
Co-ome thou lost one,
	686.2005935338076
Co-ome thou dear one!
	1020.3522585672654
THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
	592.3640888758189
—His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	1011.7538590993964
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	1616.790258840985
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
stepped off posthaste with a word:
	1726.1791562794122
_—Freeman!_
	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom said slowly:
	841.8114424048898
—Well, he is one of our saviours also.	1548.1675946015882
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed
in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along
the now reverberating boards.	1971.28175877378
But will he save the circulation?	1334.6097875563244
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
packing paper.	1557.4555915177461
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
Nannetti’s reading closet.	1368.3717040162762
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST

Like these, got out of hand:
fermenting.	1374.5154091438615
Working away, tearing away.	1196.3022706333559
And that old grey rat tearing
to get in.	1362.742526278545
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy
crown.	1648.8020798638634
Strange he never saw his real country.	1452.6542496677212
Ireland my country.	946.4170682195913
Member for
College green.	592.3640888758189
He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was
worth.	1747.9816235630658
It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news
in the official gazette.	1982.5011276392754

Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence?	1228.4482827559368
I’d like
that part.	1185.3748623298914
Learn a lot teaching others.	1376.96279230273
The personal note.	946.4292464214541
Mainly all pictures.	946.4336915828404
Shapely bathers on golden strand.	1376.8650244983396
World’s biggest

Double marriage of sisters celebrated.	1376.8572643548641
Two bridegrooms
laughing heartily at each other.	1094.2112164284472
Cuprani too, printer.	946.4336915828404
More Irish than
the Irish.	592.3640888758189
The machines clanked in threefour time.	1512.138816961438
Thump, thump, thump.	946.4292464214541
Now if he
got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on
and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	1547.4595255516563
Monkeydoodle
the whole thing.	842.9652096160346
Want a cool head.	1196.276985265057
—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	875.6794075317354
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	1452.7031143526929
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the
sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	1526.1757842232012
He handed the sheet silently
over the dirty glass screen.	1823.6668781109222
—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	946.4292463762724
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	739.5077964080244
—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
pointing backward with his thumb.	1581.045298101843
—Did you?	592.3640888758189
Hynes asked.	592.3640888758189
—Mm, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Look sharp and you’ll catch him.	1068.6438455249443
—Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	592.3640888758189
I’ll tap him too.	1376.8495037818602
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.	946.4336915828404
Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s.	706.1540896461057
Three weeks.	592.3640888758189
Third hint.	592.3640888758189
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.	837.9193279417186
This ad, you see.	638.3463744024033
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	1298.6256508090412
—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	809.6292383299414
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	1452.7246273569733
He wants it changed.	1196.2896282679212
Keyes, you see.	409.6165393890661
He wants
two keys at the top.	1094.1002323311552
Hell of a racket they make.	1511.2784948485362
He doesn’t hear it.	878.350062600941
Maybe he understands what I.	784.6746171349943
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	1986.1502332987225
—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	994.6287949371435
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	1603.24184396176
Clank it.	592.3640888758189
Clank it.	592.3640888758189
Miles
of it unreeled.	1196.44001906466
What becomes of it after?	1376.9879740919812
O, wrap up meat, parcels:
various uses, thousand and one things.	1871.0421577020252
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	1958.779832898521
HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
	592.3640888758189
—Like that, see.	946.4336915828404
Two crossed keys here.	1196.3022706333559
A circle.	592.3640888758189
Then here the name.	712.707718561181
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	1322.6558713935656
Better not teach him his own business.	1373.6247601189223
—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	1548.0809479844181
Then round the top
in leaded: the house of keys.	999.3407531014424
You see?	592.3640888758189
Do you think that’s a good idea?	872.7781501602342
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
there quietly.	1626.363237953814
—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	608.0987662556844
Innuendo of home rule.	1196.2896284392518
Tourists, you know, from
the isle of Man.	1037.1253436365973
Catches the eye, you see.	833.0346847574482
Can you do that?	1196.2425035717893
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him.	1253.3453525489808
Better not.	592.3640888758189
—We can do that, the foreman said.	1323.536922481849
Have you the design?	1196.2319578045676
—I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	650.614688826124
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	574.2114748258193
He has a
house there too.	1334.5643998437865
I’ll just run out and ask him.	1547.9907190101535
Well, you can do that
and just a little par calling attention.	1273.4756274083845
You know the usual.	1196.1853634074853
Highclass
licensed premises.	737.2918380794588
Longfelt want.	592.3640888758189
The foreman thought for an instant.	934.7680926561028
—We can do that, he said.	440.3509735118403
Let him give us a three months’ renewal.	1066.9806929969657
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	1452.590955639721
He began to check it
silently.	1512.0588586737554
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,
watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	1885.153496417176
Want to be sure of his spelling.	1056.30761639573
Proof fever.	592.3640888758189
Martin Cunningham forgot
to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning.	1248.5440611947747
It is amusing to
view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it?	1630.6780102943394
double ess ment of
a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled
pear under a cemetery wall.	2051.9597230395993
Silly, isn’t it?	424.57126876397143
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	1627.2164778440608
Thank you.	592.3640888758189
I ought to
have said something about an old hat or something.	1305.9750164344132
I could have
said.	1196.2632821573873
Looks as good as new now.	944.9187261432071
See his phiz then.	1196.3022706333559
The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its
flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers.	1887.8062447453917
Almost
human the way it sllt to call attention.	1392.2844986851392
Doing its level best to speak.	934.8169942466459
That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut.	1767.6847166669952
Everything speaks in
its own way.	1334.5761671179348
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
	592.3640888758189
The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
	1700.0409380416747
Where’s the archbishop’s letter?	1250.297090214807
It’s to be repeated in the
_Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?	803.7911367723524
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	1767.7210628036992
—Monks, sir?	592.3640888758189
a voice asked from the castingbox.	1453.0476802520107
Where’s Monks?	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	1196.2586863534546
—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a
good place I know.	791.6007922451248
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
Three months’ renewal.	737.2943990675084
Want to get some wind off my chest first.	1767.7772727249364
Try it
anyhow.	737.2943990675084
Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month.	1082.0051447468056
Tourists over for the show.	1040.2683526192438
He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,
spectacled, aproned.	1682.6747277898896
Old Monks, the dayfather.	841.8055116861434
Queer lot of stuff he
must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’
ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	1593.0174830706824
Nearing the end of his
tether now.	796.031479910135
Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say.	945.2378186895869
Wife a good cook and washer.	1512.0364793012263
Daughter working the machine in the
parlour.	1189.7606464182882
Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.	1039.4156756356856
AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
	592.3640888758189
He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	1795.622637484116
Reads it backwards first.	1196.3022706333559
Quickly he does it.	544.9296306197851
Must require some
practice that.	1376.8650244983396
mangiD kcirtaP.	592.3640888758189
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading
backwards with his finger to me.	1483.01114259549
Next year in Jerusalem.	592.3640888758189
Dear,
O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of
Egypt and into the house of bondage _alleluia.	781.41140737518
Shema Israel Adonai
Elohenu_.	592.3640888758189
No, that’s the other.	478.9535628951208
Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons.	885.1427331561614
And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water
and the butcher.	1666.1033698664935
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he
kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	1676.2204678277592
Sounds a bit silly till you
come to look into it well.	1282.532787329416
Justice it means but it’s everybody eating
everyone else.	1531.8985022047075
That’s what life is after all.	1323.7208520290499
How quickly he does that
job.	974.1000634188358
Practice makes perfect.	946.4336915828404
Seems to see with his fingers.	836.8189472043755
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
the landing.	1056.7729010191385
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch
him out perhaps.	1494.6859001751045
Better phone him up first.	1376.8212010358202
Same as
Citron’s house.	528.2276297961859
Twentyeight double four.	737.2943990675084
ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
	592.3640888758189
He went down the house staircase.	1159.543759172084
Who the deuce scrawled all over those
walls with matches?	1823.8846605224244
Looks as if they did it for a bet.	1134.2251272854965
Heavy greasy
smell there always is in those works.	1767.7334006568492
Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door
when I was there.	765.2666780726918
He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.	1027.624225350035
Ah, the soap
I put there.	748.7527617590957
Lose it out of that pocket.	640.4135337507083
Putting back his handkerchief
he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
of his trousers.	1494.0451727511274
What perfume does your wife use?	580.4954426984425
I could go home still: tram: something
I forgot.	1106.4219748581163
A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	946.6688472074518
Know who that is.	638.3332960145724
What’s up?	737.2849123494218
Pop in a minute to phone.	1196.9836847495094
Ned Lambert it
is.	395.6225402394829
He entered softly.	946.4292464214541
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
	592.3640888758189
—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
the dusty windowpane.	1344.5980388093096
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing
face, asked of it sourly:
	1354.1239880099251
—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	1324.8001536528604
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
	838.733009585279
—_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast
o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the
forest_.	2047.2263480642478
What about that, Simon?	592.3640888758189
he asked over the fringe of his
newspaper.	1464.456677042169
How’s that for high?	1096.102195772482
—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
	1470.2083311124088
—_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	1616.0231945907874
O boys! O boys!
	592.3640888758189
—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	837.1951780685814
—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	816.4551374506801
I don’t want to
hear any more of the stuff.	971.6774108692856
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	1727.3861068927456
High falutin stuff.	946.4336915828404
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	946.4107540457476
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does.	1380.0303360051344
He has influence they say.	849.9160638177934
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his
greatgranduncle.	1584.6250202513413
Close on ninety they say.	849.9160638177934
Subleader for his death
written this long time perhaps.	1767.6546903244464
Living to spite them.	1196.3022706333559
Might go first
himself.	1196.2980565823646
Johnny, make room for your uncle.	1512.0945008446145
The right honourable Hedges
Eyre Chatterton.	592.3640888758189
Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on
gale days.	1946.0862133378762
Windfall when he kicks out.	1376.8478732557971
—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	592.3640888758189
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
with pomp of tone.	1069.8739856873449
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
	592.3640888758189
—Whose land?	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom said simply.	698.0360971394099
—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	1318.3226845332506
With an
accent on the whose.	1511.778359787624
—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
—Is it his speech last night?	1070.5616457926317
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
Ned Lambert nodded.	592.3640888758189
—But listen to this, he said.	544.4100273983181
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
pushed in.	1180.024300220111
—Excuse me, J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy said, entering.	841.8114424048898
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	1039.41860477134
—I beg yours, he said.	637.6532158957044
—Good day, Jack.	592.3640888758189
—Come in.	592.3640888758189
Come in.	592.3640888758189
—Good day.	592.3640888758189
—How are you, Dedalus?	592.3640888758189
And yourself?	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy shook his head.	490.41362742750636
Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	900.6790449007088
Decline, poor chap.	737.2943990675084
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	1101.4250186962065
Touch and go with him.	676.592991678462
What’s
in the wind, I wonder.	498.168307175156
Money worry.	592.3640888758189
—_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._
	1013.6635650335551
—You’re looking extra.	1196.299154040122
—Is the editor to be seen?	931.9470077917904
O’Molloy asked, looking towards the
inner door.	945.2847150701203
—Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	748.7510033694363
To be seen and heard.	1376.8214933092565
He’s in
his sanctum with Lenehan.	972.1636750078171
O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
pink pages of the file.	1609.1293111124567
Practice dwindling.	592.3640888758189
A mighthavebeen.	592.3640888758189
Losing heart.	592.3640888758189
Reaping the whirlwind.	946.4336915828404
Used to get good retainers from D.	1082.0503853190896
and
T.	592.3640888758189
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	1172.7573082738645
Brains on their
sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	1293.3310929934757
Believe he does some literary work
for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	999.6539046156036
Wellread fellow.	592.3640888758189
Myles Crawford
began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer
about when they get wind of a new opening.	1382.2971368474678
Hot and cold
in the same breath.	833.7609884889719
Wouldn’t know which to believe.	1177.9787565024633
One story good till
you hear the next.	1183.3705449309957
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then
all blows over.	1747.6659361192972
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	1452.71138952715
—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	700.1046493195416
_Or again if we
but climb the serried mountain peaks..._
	1013.6635650335551
—Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	1512.2190640969332
Enough of the inflated
windbag!
	1376.0023806314257
—_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
souls, as it were..._
	1660.7237118821656
—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	592.3640888758189
Is he
taking anything for it?	1031.4907461595985
_—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio,
unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._
	1866.3430229482417
HIS NATIVE DORIC
	592.3640888758189
—The moon, professor MacHugh said.	592.3640888758189
He forgot Hamlet.	592.3640888758189
_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._
	1878.3740715221857
—O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	1277.334549655987
Shite and
onions! That’ll do, Ned.	592.3640888758189
Life is too short.	1196.26855684203
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	1728.6101215178276
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	1245.562177813577
An
instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s
unshaven blackspectacled face.	1557.0394296313304
—Doughy Daw! he cried.	633.0099097349434
WHAT WETHERUP SAID
	592.3640888758189
All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
cake that stuff.	1876.0413265348377
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he?	1064.9888413549545
Why they
call him Doughy Daw.	660.8738848784716
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	1376.8650244983396
Daughter engaged
to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	1577.5995995307308
Hooked that
nicely.	946.4336915828404
Open house.	592.3640888758189
Big blowout.	592.3640888758189
Wetherup always said
that.	899.5886084876175
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	1547.6249195163036
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	2038.9058237042345
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
grandly.	1275.2327529249908
—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	1388.4111784538638
—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	690.7133270883186
I must get a drink
after that.	1305.1777569049432
—Drink! the editor cried.	641.2214991546487
No drinks served before mass.	1376.8650244983396
—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	729.9863463646892
Come on, Ned.	592.3640888758189
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	623.3519310557231
The editor’s blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.	1376.7492606055052
—Will you join us, Myles?	784.6746171349943
Ned Lambert asked.	592.3640888758189
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
	592.3640888758189
—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	1187.0700641573765
We
won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
	692.5044133719111
—Where was that, Myles?	592.3640888758189
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
his toecaps.	1584.0816163237812
—In Ohio! the editor shouted.	1039.4390490390201
—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	724.1814273679192
Passing out he whispered to J.	946.4181331123225
O’Molloy:
	592.3640888758189
—Incipient jigs.	592.3640888758189
Sad case.	592.3640888758189
—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	1911.2875099896949
My Ohio!
	592.3640888758189
—A perfect cretic! the professor said.	712.8984461898281
Long, short and long.	1196.2854142614635
O, HARP EOLIAN!
	592.3640888758189
He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
unwashed teeth.	1942.7639597273796
—Bingbang, bangbang.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	1220.836064943416
—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	417.84292854885445
I just want to phone about an ad.	1474.251853775507
He went in.	946.4203558902273
—What about that leader this evening?	1512.0792610696897
professor MacHugh asked, coming
to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	1273.831014466077
—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	716.2271815673678
Never you fret.	946.4336915828404
Hello, Jack.	592.3640888758189
That’s all right.	348.34396156533904
—Good day, Myles, J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file.	1533.0461201204787
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	972.1971461241307
The telephone whirred inside.	1196.2980565823646
No, twenty...	592.3640888758189
SPOT THE WINNER
	592.3640888758189
Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues.	664.8711595301029
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	1018.0497474533449
he asked.	168.4727106542555
Sceptre with O.	592.3640888758189
Madden up.	592.3640888758189
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	683.6690707109148
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
flung open.	1629.9711491888054
—Hush, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
I hear feetstoops.	946.4336915828404
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps.	1432.305786010808
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	1455.269418686087
—It wasn’t me, sir.	971.1354761180384
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	1133.2668993179582
—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	1191.321411792171
There’s a hurricane
blowing.	1376.6743456529337
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
stooped twice.	1755.1468286386687
—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	1767.411474422733
It was Pat
Farrell shoved me, sir.	619.8065683610662
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	1692.1982893303546
—Him, sir.	592.3640888758189
—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	1106.4106205877924
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	1585.6576066771731
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
	1512.1175098825854
—Continued on page six, column four.	1512.1317147529485
—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	684.7900978330977
Is the boss...?	946.4292464214541
Yes, _Telegraph_...	592.3640888758189
To where?	592.3640888758189
Aha! Which auction
rooms?...	841.8114424048898
Aha! I see...	592.3640888758189
A COLLISION ENSUES
	592.3640888758189
The bell whirred again as he rang off.	1548.0096694772706
He came in quickly and bumped
against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	1409.2199618268633
—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
making a grimace.	1185.24620947137
—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	1003.5224923028716
Are you hurt?	737.2943990675084
I’m in a
hurry.	895.3923307876992
—Knee, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
	1627.2449542056866
—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	834.9082346389113
—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	1000.1928888994108
O’Molloy
slapped the heavy pages over.	1322.6418657584243
The noise of two shrill voices, a
mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on
the doorsteps:
	2021.7778911360504
We are the boys of Wexford
	647.1478790071887
Who fought with heart and hand.	1512.1068566723113
EXIT BLOOM
	592.3640888758189
—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
ad of Keyes’s.	946.4262828716442
Want to fix it up.	800.1329800283462
They tell me he’s round there in
Dillon’s.	1196.3462277943054
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	1072.5302540555501
The editor who,
leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	1909.8571926089548
—Begone! he said.	262.36878812105795
The world is before you.	1096.078845425475
—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	946.427764524902
O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.	1450.4317904660002
—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	1574.2813900340145
Look at the young scamps
after him.	1156.8857174665777
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	845.8673863706415
A STREET CORTÈGE
	592.3640888758189
Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots.	1716.999049182727
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
and you’ll kick.	1190.1481430747635
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
walk.	1186.7449477752498
Small nines.	592.3640888758189
Steal upon larks.	946.4336915828404
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
feet past the fireplace to J.	1767.6923643131342
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands.	1584.62016915483
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
Myles Crawford said with a start.	859.7399546325091
Where are the other two
gone?	1250.4042435111878
the professor said, turning.	587.6501509062201
They’re gone round to the Oval for a
drink.	695.65786972231
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	724.0965072892376
Came over last night.	712.6581647377059
—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
Where’s my hat?	822.5191552046186
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	1839.4065841303916
They jingled then in the
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	1456.3401766483225
—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	939.875385426576
—Seems to be, J.	592.3640888758189
Who has the
most matches?	1376.6350619554644
THE CALUMET OF PEACE
	592.3640888758189
He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	1747.3930120566968
Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	1837.076814165462
O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	1280.2046913236854
—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	946.4336915828393
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	1133.0321283088135
He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
	1293.4744028585194
’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
	1452.7224648605095
’Twas empire charmed thy heart.	1376.8650244983396
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	1234.3515022908007
You bloody old Roman empire?	592.3640888758189
Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
Lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:
	1557.44595611239
—Silence for my brandnew riddle!
	1376.8250825456307
—_Imperium romanum_, J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy said gently.	633.0255187722685
It sounds nobler than
British or Brixton.	724.1084873131331
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	1268.312024223845
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	1470.182314916159
—That’s it, he said.	463.704226118033
We are the fat.	822.4828954457153
You and I are the fat in the fire.	794.8748940792586
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
	592.3640888758189
—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	1196.3134466168794
We think of Rome,
imperial, imperious, imperative.	885.1534237904042
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
	1767.7688841065128
—What was their civilisation?	991.975450508825
Vast, I allow: but vile.	1039.41860477134
Cloacae: sewers.	592.3640888758189
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to
be here.	900.9139613923061
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	1082.0160350118429
The Roman, like the
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
obsession.	1813.1717366679395
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to
be here.	977.75590127494
Let us construct a watercloset._
	1512.138816961438
—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	795.3154627539283
Our old ancient
ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial
to the running stream.	1497.1541249797392
—They were nature’s gentlemen, J.	946.4203554835648
O’Molloy murmured.	592.3640888758189
But we have
also Roman law.	748.730287772454
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	809.5736584060694
—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	1009.8183870898313
O’Molloy asked.	592.3640888758189
It was at the royal university dinner.	983.0147568958545
Everything was going swimmingly
...	1196.3470214294587
—First my riddle, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
Are you ready?	946.4336915828404
Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
the hallway.	1045.7871864200636
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	1426.0189844230576
—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.	660.8681600265427
—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously.	784.6746171349952
Youth led by
Experience visits Notoriety.	592.3640888758189
—How do you do?	468.95647039620343
the editor said, holding out a hand.	1371.9729261160169
Come in.	592.3640888758189
Your
governor is just gone.	1376.861144421135
—Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	1055.8842173071043
Reflect, ponder,
excogitate, reply.	1196.3022706333559
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
signature.	1737.4768931139
the editor asked.	1247.987856020663
Bit torn off.	946.4336915828404
—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
—That old pelters, the editor said.	899.1588696259902
Who tore it?	946.4248011905848
Was he short taken?	1196.3022706333559
On swift sail flaming
	1196.3022706333559
From storm and south
	1196.2938424605543
He comes, pale vampire,
	991.9789448889109
Mouth to my mouth.	991.915276990303
—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
shoulders.	1213.499479815391
Foot and mouth?	647.2116048892475
Are you turned...?	946.4336915828404
Bullockbefriending bard.	592.3640888758189
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
	592.3640888758189
—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	748.7545201171381
The letter is not mine.	1376.8016691180824
Mr
Garrett Deasy asked me to...	585.0618448848629
—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	819.3553214701998
The
bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	885.1516420694318
By Jesus, she had the foot and
mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the
waiter’s face in the Star and Garter.	1078.4132051424094
A woman brought sin into the world.	612.8731084100812
For Helen, the runaway wife of
Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	683.7844305934818
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	592.3640888758189
—Is he a widower?	991.9405056644335
—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
typescript.	1262.7136758643023
Emperor’s horses.	946.4292464214541
An Irishman saved his life on
the ramparts of Vienna.	1029.6811707240195
Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell,
graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	592.6531903408754
Sent his heir over to make the king an
Austrian fieldmarshal now.	1162.956448418958
Going to be trouble there one day.	1323.672465181227
Wild
geese.	592.3640888758189
O yes, every time.	991.9763606997212
Don’t you forget that!
	1040.733722786603
—The moot point is did he forget it, J.	1293.428859029424
O’Molloy said quietly,
turning a horseshoe paperweight.	1426.1101032227286
Saving princes is a thank you job.	1616.6794617130204
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	648.8387792496932
—And if not?	593.4997817085673
—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	760.9437638580889
A Hungarian it was one
day...	783.4756762966116
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
	592.3640888758189
—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	1161.5832511502197
Success for
us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	1438.5780013279098
We were never
loyal to the successful.	1452.006002473264
We serve them.	946.4336915828404
I teach the blatant Latin
language.	748.7527617590948
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
the maxim: time is money.	1784.3768716376162
Material domination.	592.3640888758189
_Dominus!_ Lord! Where
is the spirituality?	885.020552512919
Lord Jesus?	592.3640888758189
Lord Salisbury?	592.3640888758189
A sofa in a westend
club.	1511.5274920076074
But the Greek!
	592.3640888758189
KYRIE ELEISON!
	592.3640888758189
A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
lips.	1632.884053201687
—The Greek! he said again.	712.6257294910503
_Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the
Semite and the Saxon know not.	660.0103142445078
_Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.	918.9581520836913
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	783.3449710270881
_Kyrie eleison!_
The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	1401.0876425671179
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered
at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	1203.1427385714578
Yes, yes.	592.3640888758189
They went
under.	946.4292464214541
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve
the fortunes of Greece.	1579.7339647889469
Loyal to a lost cause.	1376.539660591796
He strode away from them towards the window.	1100.0072832859396
—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they
always fell.	1085.909423583139
—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	1082.3055163546521
Owing to a brick received in
the latter half of the _matinée_.	1632.5893827002144
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
	592.3640888758189
He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:
	795.3126779310994
LENEHAN’S LIMERICK
	592.3640888758189
—_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh
Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	1196.2318327705198
As he mostly sees double
To wear them why trouble?	1196.2955280560975
I can’t see the Joe Miller.	546.2410387615696
Can you?_
	946.4292464214541
In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	592.3640888758189
Whose mother is beastly dead.	878.3787075107302
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	1072.3611086545043
—That’ll be all right, he said.	548.0624914505266
I’ll read the rest after.	1334.6535774674894
That’ll be
all right.	385.5543012919396
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	1197.4376392667104
—But my riddle! he said.	637.6514189557978
What opera is like a railwayline?	1039.5294571409702
Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.	1003.524259793509
Lenehan announced gladly:
	946.4336915828404
—_The Rose of Castile_.	592.3640888758189
Rows of cast steel.	1196.2980565823646
He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	903.299683248119
Mr O’Madden Burke fell
back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	1386.107918408125
—Help! he sighed.	946.4248011905848
I feel a strong weakness.	1376.8194723809825
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
tissues.	1910.8370617475844
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.	1079.9721406556985
—Paris, past and present, he said.	796.1529908625337
You look like communards.	1196.2865115175523
—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	1018.0357630198813
O’Molloy said in
quiet mockery.	1196.2946471775294
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland
between you?	1057.5102167647253
You look as though you had done the deed.	1626.5532356169354
General
Bobrikoff.	592.3640888758189
OMNIUM GATHERUM
	592.3640888758189
—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	1003.5136546448668
—All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
Law, the classics...	946.4292464214541
—The turf, Lenehan put in.	784.6606269810447
—Literature, the press.	593.5256885293372
—If Bloom were here, the professor said.	694.2757863731623
The gentle art of
advertisement.	1185.2489365268975
—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added.	592.3640888758189
The vocal muse.	946.4336915828404
Dublin’s
prime favourite.	1196.2980565823646
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	1376.8301024617833
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
cold in the park.	1031.9204372943707
The gate was open.	991.9789449784407
“YOU CAN DO IT!”
	592.3640888758189
The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.	1196.2925958228618
—I want you to write something for me, he said.	817.9680437596356
Something with a bite
in it.	695.1278247102836
You can do it.	633.9421253065568
I see it in your face.	526.4955992222494
_In the lexicon of
youth_...	1376.8650244983396
See it in your face.	550.3753873402753
See it in your eye.	651.5195998532784
Lazy idle little schemer.	822.5589667907208
—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	1178.6498351915589
Great
nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory.	724.1084873131331
All balls! Bulldosing the
public! Give them something with a bite in it.	747.3957222501025
Put us all into it, damn
its soul.	1700.037066478367
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.	592.3640888758189
—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	869.1403745529832
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	1304.2712987734578
—He wants you for the pressgang, J.	919.1319515345249
THE GREAT GALLAHER
	592.3640888758189
—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
emphasis.	940.6161778835353
Wait a minute.	556.5751485739802
We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
Clarence.	816.0672668990467
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	790.0060537090721
That was a pen.	1195.9744958649092
You
know how he made his mark?	1305.2269638341168
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
suppose.	1052.1731156143467
I’ll show you.	676.4721488201675
He pushed past them to the files.	1287.131398404427
—Look at here, he said turning.	1104.0363799044517
The _New York World_ cabled for a
special.	1003.4132043964935
Remember that time?	647.1660572497977
Professor MacHugh nodded.	592.3640888758189
—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
hat.	1060.33660012172
Where it took place.	991.9823236119397
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	592.3640888758189
Joe Brady and
the rest of them.	432.94931352172915
Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car.	675.7713675314258
Whole route, see?	946.4336915828404
—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	592.3640888758189
He has that
cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	1230.205653519524
Holohan told me.	489.3501573345719
You know Holohan?	592.3640888758189
—Hop and carry one, is it?	798.0773603272484
Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
the corporation.	1134.214687793273
A night watchman.	946.4336915828404
Stephen turned in surprise.	1196.2865115175523
You don’t say so?	1096.4559722208132
A friend of my father’s, is it?	1002.4089396199948
—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	650.6169669697325
Let Gumley mind the
stones, see they don’t run away.	1312.7045884212837
Look at here.	737.2909362695849
Inspiration of genius.	737.2874734175336
Cabled right away.	946.4336915828404
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March?	592.3640888758189
Have
you got that?	633.9294940705023
The telephone whirred.	946.4292464214541
A DISTANT VOICE
	592.3640888758189
—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.	1222.163212022122
—B is parkgate.	946.4336915828404
—T is viceregal lodge.	991.9754506878854
C is where murder took place.	1334.6456633605148
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles.	1686.581939074846
An illstarched
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
waistcoat.	1668.5759231614106
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	592.3640888758189
Who’s there?...	737.2874734175336
—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	735.0215152308232
F.A.B.P.	592.3640888758189
Got that?	592.3640888758189
X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	809.5698559645951
The professor came to the inner door.	876.138898109231
—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	932.8348538699602
—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	1105.313610021562
X is Davy’s
publichouse, see?	946.4270237130448
CLEVER, VERY
	592.3640888758189
—Clever, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
history.	1376.7003105504562
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	1452.6760715069008
—I saw it, the editor said proudly.	1218.664700654054
I was present.	946.4336915828404
Dick Adams, the
besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
myself.	1115.6343364569188
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
	1699.799419403298
—Madam, I’m Adam.	592.3640888758189
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	592.3640888758189
—History! Myles Crawford cried.	592.3640888758189
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was
there first.	1039.387101654338
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	1767.7467425822042
Out of
an advertisement.	991.8348716332305
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	952.9116637223781
That gave him the
leg up.	1023.416818022624
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld.	759.7927671488412
That’s press.	946.4336915828404
That’s talent.	946.4336915828404
Pyatt! He
was all their daddies!
	1055.8365599840636
—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.	905.9288399744722
Are you there?...	647.1842956733051
Yes, he’s here still.	1377.013665725276
Come across
yourself.	946.4336915828404
—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	1824.1330016211389
the editor cried.	543.3574841821261
—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.	592.3640888758189
—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	592.3640888758189
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	569.41591472312
—O yes, J.	592.3640888758189
And it turned
out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
Skin-the-Goat.	676.1266972912024
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
	1250.3945398681585
—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	1064.7649582343147
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.	858.0610429802821
Ah, bloody nonsense.	946.4336915828404
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	1196.7238556827624
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	1871.0774890473344
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	1548.045956668189
How do you know?	331.32675097327564
RHYMES AND REASONS
	592.3640888758189
Mouth, south.	592.3640888758189
Is the mouth south someway?	1376.8542798035937
Or the south a mouth?	1376.8331332137523
Must be
some.	946.415910520381
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	1376.8650244983396
Rhymes: two men dressed the
same, looking the same, two by two.	1686.938177702542
la tua pace
	2415.9868882288847
che parlar ti piace
	2415.9788711002393
Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.	1700.0678893036218
He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
russet, entwining, _per l’aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più ardenti._
But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
south: tomb womb.	2026.6505827356914
—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	692.4989564728647
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	1298.54142037087
—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
construction on my words.	1660.8997407829459
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running
away with you.	1632.9476873999379
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes
and Edmund Burke?	660.0101279471531
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod
boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the
Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s
Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	886.5422519074925
Why bring
in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	1376.5193778626287
Sufficient for the
day is the newspaper thereof.	1366.3457688077722
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
	592.3640888758189
—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
face.	1099.4866452378005
Irish volunteers.	592.3640888758189
Where are you now?	991.9942305378066
Established 1763.	592.3640888758189
Dr Lucas.	592.3640888758189
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	841.8109203632506
—Well, J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.	612.349533168505
the editor said.	441.25096073332594
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	592.3640888758189
He has a strain of it
in his blood.	1203.054830425339
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	592.3640888758189
—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
....	1233.2348792613914
But no matter.	946.4290995627673
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
	964.3867636642716
—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	1002.2965755028551
It was in that case of fratricide,
the Childs murder case.	1048.8600068511914
Bushe defended him.	946.4336915828404
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._
	1570.393137262813
By the way how did he find that out?	1333.045012915379
He died in his sleep.	1020.2812492658987
Or the other
story, beast with two backs?	1409.6937232300443
—What was that?	593.4643785573064
the professor asked.	785.0062035052277
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
	592.3640888758189
—He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	913.7110693882344
O’Molloy said, of Roman justice
as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	1045.353501568545
And he
cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	903.298410474493
—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	660.8681600265427
O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	947.3395495552928
False lull.	592.3640888758189
Something quite ordinary.	946.4336915828404
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	1585.5795474576976
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	1967.3383344836968
A POLISHED PERIOD
	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
	1196.2945740404496
—He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and
of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of
sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of
soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._
	1888.0163995547036
—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	680.5428645867416
—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	592.3640888758189
—You like it?	593.5083534005756
O’Molloy asked Stephen.	592.3640888758189
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	1632.796535727137
He
took a cigarette from the case.	858.4314109898611
O’Molloy offered his case to
Myles Crawford.	841.8084770402942
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
trophy, saying:
	1575.7444438726775
—Muchibus thankibus.	592.3640888758189
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
	592.3640888758189
—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	1018.1000300542898
O’Molloy said
to Stephen.	592.3640888758189
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
hush poets: A.	1378.9739601445158
That Blavatsky woman started it.	1039.41860477134
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	1342.2124226973967
has been telling some yankee
interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
ask him about planes of consciousness.	1633.5550807625445
Magennis thinks you must have
been pulling A.	716.0746109035604
E.’s leg.	946.4336915828404
He is a man of the very highest morale,
Magennis.	910.8611881168656
Speaking about me.	737.2840105113547
What did he say?	633.892156186449
What did he say?	633.892156186449
What did he say
about me?	1056.846967655677
Don’t ask.	737.2840105113547
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	1106.4301849033661
Wait a moment.	461.547359392372
Let me say one thing.	1376.8534309955508
The finest display of oratory I
ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
society.	1193.5394413051615
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	1697.2318872657477
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
	564.3040945095365
—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	592.3640888758189
Then you can imagine the style of his
discourse.	1626.2273656995446
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	650.6143477654713
O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on
the Trinity college estates commission.	933.4415671554059
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s
frock.	1105.3016567423088
Go on.	592.3640888758189
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely
upon the new movement.	1851.566607191394
It was then a new movement.	1177.8808116270684
We were weak,
therefore worthless.	1376.8650244983396
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
focus.	2016.7181706079325
In ferial tone he addressed J.	946.4292463762724
O’Molloy:
	592.3640888758189
—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	1569.9478980678975
That he had
prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
shorthandwriter in the hall.	1292.344631450884
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
beard round it.	1738.0049131112837
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
looked (though he was not) a dying man.	1527.296169830301
O’Molloy’s towards
Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	1173.2515875794284
His
unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
withering hair.	1976.3376813443822
Still seeking, he said:
	457.04336643229624
—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	889.150604346161
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	1195.4538266923964
He raised his head firmly.	1376.8851954042873
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	1512.1104065949905
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	1556.8083543370612
He began:
	592.3640888758189
_—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
since by my learned friend.	1174.046556469335
It seemed to me that I had been transported
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this
age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful
Moses._
	1343.405282570718
His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	2002.9472295495357
_And let our
crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.	936.7502778236777
Look out.	592.3640888758189
Could you try your hand
at it yourself?	1548.0703524806622
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	1024.189230380291
I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me._
	1584.8978371599926
FROM THE FATHERS
	592.3640888758189
It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they
were good could be corrupted.	1884.1917656793607
Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.	592.3640888758189
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
language?	1787.5798306891777
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	1700.8048742350345
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
furrow the waters of the known globe.	1993.4069168242283
You have but emerged from
primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
history and a polity._
	1938.2281047236852
Child, man, effigy.	946.4336915828404
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	1727.6010352632597
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.	1226.8280240240663
Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	1569.5419290961145
Israel is
weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
arms.	1494.1615092622756
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
our name._
	1946.1763704717353
A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	1548.087479802311
He lifted his voice above it
boldly:
	1616.767367661982
_—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never
have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor
followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	1485.9596633347553
He would never have spoken
with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have
come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of
the outlaw._
	1222.9507162198347
He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	1392.2428372026948
OMINOUS—FOR HIM!
	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy said not without regret:
	1196.299461264378
—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	1200.5967837098367
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—
expectorated—demise, Lenehan added.	1438.3587847457268
And with a great future behind him.	1287.1051798378799
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and
pattering up the staircase.	1588.7266402573277
—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	1108.8256964986645
Gone with the wind.	772.6472362076304
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	841.4817673836056
Miles
of ears of porches.	1376.8650244983396
The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the
four winds.	1870.452492744367
Dead noise.	592.3640888758189
Akasic
records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	1767.7088182918187
Love and laud him: me
no more.	1202.5491991563542
I have money.	946.4336915828404
—Gentlemen, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
suggest that the house do now adjourn?	1462.841368760623
—You take my breath away.	1376.8417436469852
It is not perchance a French compliment?	885.1243309913928
’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	1557.0073771228074
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	1700.023751608759
All that are in favour
say ay, Lenehan announced.	1106.412804900222
The contrary no.	946.4336915828404
I declare it carried.	1196.3022706333559
To
which particular boosing shed...?	1376.8650244983396
My casting vote is: Mooney’s!
	748.7545201171381
—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	1911.3399624356837
Yes,
we will not.	1196.266538238798
By no manner of means.	1020.3313811193168
Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his
umbrella:
	1511.900785371952
—Lay on, Macduff!
	592.3640888758189
—Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
shoulder.	911.3816186162411
Let us go.	946.4248011905848
Where are those blasted keys?	1376.8582747755074
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	1440.9094771326347
—Foot and mouth.	647.2116048892475
I know.	592.3640888758189
That’ll be all right.	385.5543012919396
That’ll go in.	991.9623833636343
Where are
they?	528.9628741836711
That’s all right.	348.34396156533904
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	1086.6390637104953
LET US HOPE
	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
	1275.2229051938893
—I hope you will live to see it published.	1392.3301781824143
Myles, one moment.	593.5229010712899
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	1042.9447484502891
—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	446.19654001535713
That is fine, isn’t it?	757.9922728494643
It
has the prophetic vision.	1376.8000647091096
_Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.	706.155333436352
Kingdoms of this world.	899.5413482617219
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen
today.	1003.524259793509
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
rushed out into the street, yelling:
	1860.4974153040077
—Racing special!
	592.3640888758189
I have much, much to learn.	1512.0962018284872
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	641.8809608869865
—I have a vision too, Stephen said.	885.0932748951154
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	1153.4985562949846
Crawford will
follow.	946.4336915828404
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
	1767.670531937413
—Racing special!
	592.3640888758189
DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
	592.3640888758189
—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.	1293.471628966834
—Where is that?	397.770905500622
the professor asked.	785.0062035052277
—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	1512.138816961438
Against the wall.	556.5766554558987
Face glistering
tallow under her fustian shawl.	1616.8000223662407
Frantic hearts.	592.3640888758189
Akasic records.	592.3640888758189
Quicker, darlint!
	592.3640888758189
On now.	592.3640888758189
Dare it.	592.3640888758189
Let there be life.	1196.2938424605543
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.	580.2346084796676
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	1910.9467595083456
They
shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
with the blade of a knife.	2002.2782260500837
Two and three in silver and one and seven in
coppers.	1747.8220793172484
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	1947.591193058584
—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	592.3640888758189
LIFE ON THE RAW
	592.3640888758189
—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress...	1376.7989511271999
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from
a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the
brawn.	1381.4398258820474
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile
and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the
other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,
threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	1687.6199985776327
Glory be to God.	592.3640888758189
They had no idea it was that high.	1427.209065277861
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	592.3640888758189
Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who
got a bottleful from a passionist father.	1673.0709342204418
Florence MacCabe takes a
crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	963.5904484578184
—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	973.8427741954065
Vestal virgins.	592.3640888758189
I can
see them.	822.5199103226339
What’s keeping our friend?	1096.0981837705078
He turned.	592.3640888758189
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	1814.4317496984725
Hard after them
Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
face, talking with J.	1183.8343249490217
O’Molloy.	592.3640888758189
—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	1299.5856608482575
He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.	1196.2770556074224
RETURN OF BLOOM
	592.3640888758189
I see them.	737.2710602397635
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:
	1196.1533244282994
—Mr Crawford! A moment!
	592.3640888758189
—_Telegraph_! Racing special!
	592.3640888758189
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	1188.4132364206478
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:
	689.8403314271059
—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
	964.2984831159458
INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
	592.3640888758189
—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	1171.5738163558954
I spoke with Mr Keyes
just now.	615.2647573065501
He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	1531.7159056985129
After he’ll
see.	991.943768705367
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the
Saturday pink.	982.6919870232449
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told
councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	784.5082703925286
I can have access to it
in the national library.	894.2156181558671
House of keys, don’t you see?	540.4778822041686
His name is
Keyes.	592.3640888758189
It’s a play on the name.	1202.2712007466262
But he practically promised he’d give
the renewal.	1432.9902697766515
But he wants just a little puff.	1323.6353247286168
What will I tell him, Mr
Crawford?	592.3640888758189
K.M.A.	592.3640888758189
—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	1377.083554405541
Myles Crawford said throwing
out his arm for emphasis.	1391.3203432062246
Tell him that straight from the stable.	1304.7940448143336
A bit nervy.	946.4336915828404
Look out for squalls.	1196.2664120311244
All off for a drink.	594.3375692541495
Arm in arm.	946.4292464214541
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	1699.767712490244
Usual blarney.	592.3640888758189
Wonder is
that young Dedalus the moving spirit.	1003.512123342831
Has a good pair of boots on him
today.	1626.4327985970872
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	1253.7121708357927
Careless chap.	592.3640888758189
What was he doing in Irishtown?	737.2597301282422
—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
suppose it’s worth a short par.	1052.7407076655443
He’d give the ad, I think.	795.305804274487
K.M.R.I.A.	592.3640888758189
—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
shoulder.	776.2731965286675
Any time he likes, tell him.	1197.3984446761567
While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
jerkily.	1429.5994460053198
RAISING THE WIND
	592.3640888758189
—_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	839.5813947035422
I’m up to
here.	1376.9047411991212
I’ve been through the hoop myself.	1616.5591057735708
I was looking for a fellow to
back a bill for me no later than last week.	1639.451275449776
Sorry, Jack.	592.3640888758189
You must take
the will for the deed.	1547.7217349413347
With a heart and a half if I could raise the
wind anyhow.	1140.4688501157289
O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	1364.0890741158364
They caught
up on the others and walked abreast.	1351.9330505692055
—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
railings.	1787.0628293670468
—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	1018.0929296620283
Two old
Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.	618.5918331406244
SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
	592.3640888758189
—That’s new, Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
That’s copy.	946.4336915828404
Out for the waxies’
Dargle.	784.3957814853816
Two old trickies, what?	1196.3022706333559
—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	1191.2211716192653
They see
the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’
blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.	972.644763450026
But it makes them
giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...	1837.0964283383764
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
	592.3640888758189
—Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
No poetic licence.	946.4336915828404
We’re in the
archdiocese here.	1335.1035637320092
—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
of the onehandled adulterer.	1340.292978929129
—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	1185.356081903871
I like that.	360.2611213334049
I see the
idea.	991.8234808016464
I see what you mean.	1040.584239254935
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
	592.3640888758189
—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
tired to look up or down or to speak.	1383.9636253370936
They put the bag of plums between
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	1807.213635426398
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	1823.6123204824507
Myles Crawford said.	592.3640888758189
So long as they do no worse.	1305.2250490568003
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS.	592.3640888758189
SPARTANS GNASH
MOLARS.	592.3640888758189
ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.	592.3640888758189
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
Gorgias, the sophist.	849.3600394885663
It is said of him that none could tell if he were
bitterer against others or against himself.	1860.6655454369982
He was the son of a noble
and a bondwoman.	1240.279562183945
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	977.0990422402084
Poor Penelope.	592.3640888758189
Penelope Rich.	592.3640888758189
They made ready to cross O’Connell street.	766.5566535025183
HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
	592.3640888758189
At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper
Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit.	1176.8726819748647
Hackney cars, cabs,
delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water
floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,
rapidly.	2113.242186798263
WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?	592.3640888758189
—But what do you call it?	420.5139726705103
Myles Crawford asked.	592.3640888758189
Where did they get the
plums?	1334.5659060214496
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	592.3640888758189
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	592.3640888758189
—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
reflect.	1455.0367772797686
Call it, let me see.	615.4853337761962
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._
	1700.070883610277
—No, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of The Plums._
	592.3640888758189
—I see, the professor said.	480.7246225930336
He laughed richly.	946.4336915828404
Moses and the promised land.	1184.475107435433
We gave him that idea, he added to J.	1107.0985317436157
O’Molloy.	592.3640888758189
HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
his peace.	1522.3994822908833
—I see, the professor said.	480.7246225930336
He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
through the meshes of his wry smile.	1322.4684076785773

—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly.	1512.6707625502288
That tickles me, I must
say.	660.8681600265427
—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s
truth was known.	1003.47880008265
Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch.	1512.1352658891194

Graham Lemon’s, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.	1458.92464805367
Heart to heart talks.	1196.2896282679212
Blood of the Lamb.	592.3640888758189
His slow feet walked him riverward, reading.	1616.8260600451579
Are you saved?	946.4292464214541
All are
washed in the blood of the lamb.	553.9638935335953
God wants blood victim.	1196.3022706333559
Birth, hymen,

All heartily welcome.	946.4336915828404
Paying game.	592.3640888758189
Torry and Alexander last year.	675.4903430438009
His wife will put

Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the

Our Saviour.	592.3640888758189
Wake up in the dead of night and see

I could see the bluey silver over it.	1126.1111561384007
Night I went down to
the pantry in the kitchen.	1038.3148093451073
Don’t like all the smells in it waiting to
rush out.	1795.6183598178752
What was it she wanted?	1185.2486211334694
The Malaga raisins.	592.3640888758189
Thinking of
Spain.	592.3640888758189
Before Rudy was born.	565.3064222096644
The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny.	1376.8650244983396
Very good for the brain.	1019.9753025786133
From Butler’s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor’s walk.	1064.569892475194
Dedalus’ daughter there still outside Dillon’s auctionrooms.	1003.5229525982379

Birth every year almost.	1196.2896282679212
That’s in their
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the
absolution.	1901.3215424422433
Increase and multiply.	946.4336915828404
Did you ever hear such an idea?	1452.6917342226807
Eat

No families themselves to feed.	1376.8427541761992

I’d like to see them
do the black fast Yom Kippur.	969.0021848803802
One meal and a collation for
fear he’d collapse on the altar.	1415.3194915254144
Never pick it out of her.	374.47970706072425
Like getting
£.	592.3640888758189
out of him.	190.4523146991814
Does himself well.	946.4336915828404
No guests.	592.3640888758189
All for number one.	676.4678254441792
Watching his water.	946.4292464214541
Bring your own bread and butter.	1159.5503826160543
His reverence:
mum’s the word.	997.657652779344
Good Lord, that poor child’s dress is in flitters.	1584.637244641338
Underfed she looks
too.	1196.3022706333559
Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes.	1512.138816961438
Proof of the pudding.	1195.3654486092223
Undermines the constitution.	946.4336915828404
As he set foot on O’Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
the parapet.	1205.7206917713302
Brewery barge with export stout.	1376.8650244983396
Sea air sours
it, I heard.	748.7545201171381
Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see
the brewery.	1107.9824288665927
Vats of porter wonderful.	1196.30745725541
Rats
get in too.	1196.283394728443
Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating.	1392.0964927136731
Dead
drunk on the porter.	1376.4566744324795
Drink till they puke again like christians.	1616.8000228294015
Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats.	592.3640888758189
Well, of course, if we knew all the
things.	1141.0441060333294
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
quaywalls, gulls.	1911.306443602142
Rough weather outside.	946.4336915828404
If I threw myself down?	1039.4156756356842
Reuben
J’s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.	1746.5207681368283
One and
eightpence too much.	602.4313038265295
It’s the droll way he comes out with the
things.	1228.6716283296548
Looking for grub.	946.4336915828404
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	1767.7260413361073
Elijah thirtytwo feet
per sec is com.	1234.3756195277865
Not a bit.	461.5479987353844
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of
swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	1872.9644675316558
Not such damn fools.	1196.3022706333559
Also the
day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the
wake fifty yards astern.	872.1954583599836
Live by their wits.	1196.276985265057
They wheeled, flapping.	946.4292464214541
The hungry famished gull
	1196.3022706333559
Flaps o’er the waters dull.	655.7340457429793
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	1700.0499226613622
But then Shakespeare has
no rhymes: blank verse.	1196.2917351053736
The flow of the language it is.	1049.7287444677495
The thoughts.	592.3640888758189
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit
	729.0210849649845
Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.	1017.463890862407
—Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
	661.0938791066782
His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.	1870.8039247846277
Australians they must be this time of year.	1077.564412821854
Shiny peels: polishes them
up with a rag or a handkerchief.	1405.2102896216566
Those poor birds.	946.4336915828404
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes
for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down
into the Liffey.	1420.0785636011722
See that?	592.3640888758189
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all
from their heights, pouncing on prey.	1946.0646285958042
Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his
hands.	1653.6884084219514
They never expected that.	1196.3022706333559
Live on fish, fishy flesh they
have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose.	1686.8003462061772
Swans from Anna Liffey swim down
here sometimes to preen themselves.	1275.2315447941307
No accounting for tastes.	1196.3022706333559
Wonder
what kind is swanmeat.	1185.2897902848892
Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.	1009.731731519411
They wheeled flapping weakly.	1196.2980565823646
I’m not going to throw any more.	933.8435246310949
Penny
quite enough.	946.4292464214541
Lot of thanks I get.	592.3640888758189
Not even a caw.	1196.272770789106
They spread foot and
mouth disease too.	900.1721593380327
If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes
like that.	1501.317919037345
But then why is it that saltwater fish are
not salty?	1686.8498224976502
How is that?	397.770905500622
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	1985.80429537547
Kino’s
	592.3640888758189
Good idea that.	946.4336915828404
Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation.	1547.4384099018268
How can you
own water really?	1512.1156905775583
It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same,
which in the stream of life we trace.	1405.6708728370477
Because life is a stream.	1376.6289030878881
All
kinds of places are good for ads.	1409.675041313272
That quack doctor for the clap used
to be stuck up in all the greenhouses.	1393.402862091317
Never see it now.	749.2928699688955
Strictly
confidential.	592.3640888758189
Dr Hy Franks.	592.3640888758189
Didn’t cost him a red like Maginni the
dancing master self advertisement.	1406.8864668599822
Got fellows to stick them up or
stick them up himself for that matter on the q.	1652.1494402049627
running in to loosen
a button.	2415.9080661085954
Just the place too.	1196.2578297831753
POST NO BILLS.	592.3640888758189
POST 110
PILLS.	592.3640888758189
Some chap with a dose burning him.	1452.0296934459661
If he...?	592.3640888758189
I don’t believe it.	713.3898583763583
He wouldn’t surely?	1196.2682990677554
Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes.	1426.0955465644058
Think no more about
that.	895.769145940642
After one.	592.3640888758189
Timeball on the ballastoffice is down.	1511.776658678597
Dunsink time.	592.3640888758189
Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball’s.	1039.4148969240293
I never
exactly understood.	1196.3022706333559
There’s a priest.	899.4240278089297
Could ask him.	737.2849123494218
Par it’s Greek:
parallel, parallax.	748.7545201171381
Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her
about the transmigration.	1170.2344525389958
O rocks!
	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	1190.9305711442523
She’s
right after all.	1040.6130954774933
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the
sound.	1122.5012454625246
She’s not exactly witty.	1376.7657306768358
Blurt out what I was
thinking.	619.1724741368272
Still, I don’t know.	484.4543484247575
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base
barreltone voice.	970.9172233095181
He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was
singing into a barrel.	1812.6224042016183
Now, isn’t that wit.	971.1806912237264
They used to call him big
Ben.	972.1761993119849
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	1557.409088964352
Appetite like an
albatross.	1196.294939936755
Get outside of a baron of beef.	1616.0473155940667
Powerful man he was at
stowing away number one Bass.	945.32688083833
Barrel of Bass.	592.3640888758189
It all works out.	1196.2980565823646
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him
along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	1874.9273932609851
He
read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	1512.0727234792835
Wisdom Hely’s.	592.3640888758189
Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	1570.793030429794
Our
staple food.	946.4336915828404
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
street.	1871.0221426851276
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	1767.7627819980116
They are
not Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men.	692.5033291971034
Doesn’t bring in any business either.	1452.7297065155794
I
suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	2083.6593325843637
I
bet that would have caught on.	1452.7065074519649
Smart girls writing something catch the
eye at once.	1305.5179341560922
Everyone dying to know what she’s writing.	1268.6047038255924
Get twenty of
them round you if you stare at nothing.	1491.4322414948435
Have a finger in the pie.	1512.6468382150424
Women
too.	592.3640888758189
Pillar of salt.	737.2909362695849
Wouldn’t have it of course because he
didn’t think of it himself first.	1496.1860121079974
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
false stain of black celluloid.	1344.5911331170682
His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s
potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	1462.2999753064175
You can’t lick ’em.	1376.8145371854785
Our envelopes.	592.3640888758189
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	573.272155203355
Can’t stop,
Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser
_Kansell,_ sold by Hely’s Ltd, 85 Dame street.	908.6341014889964
Well out of that ruck I
am.	610.7575601457183
Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.	1686.3299770606225
Tranquilla convent.	592.3640888758189
That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	1557.1921475261554
Wimple suited her small head.	1376.866034962473
I am sure she was crossed
in love by her eyes.	1618.802462386822
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	826.0503711918697
I
disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	1548.0171931582724
But glad to communicate
with the outside world.	1699.3884628104688
Our great day, she said.	746.0028278035526
Feast of Our Lady of
Mount Carmel.	592.3640888758189
Sweet name too: caramel.	1196.3033680726708
She knew I, I think she knew by
the way she.	791.9092491172681
If she had married she would have changed.	1474.1460202913981
I suppose they
really were short of money.	1474.2112335082224
Fried everything in the best butter all the
same.	819.166602875078
No lard for them.	698.1136495319619
They like
buttering themselves in and out.	1260.0023730106664
Molly tasting it, her veil up.	1512.1255373365234
Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker’s daughter.	836.1492863554647
It was a nun they say invented
barbed wire.	1557.2471580184697
Rover
cycleshop.	592.3640888758189
How long ago is that?	818.5160175151764
Year Phil
Gilligan died.	592.3640888758189
We were in Lombard street west.	559.7665683255337
Wait: was in Thom’s.	592.3640888758189
Got
the job in Wisdom Hely’s year we married.	927.4052095456915
Ten years ago:
ninetyfour he died yes that’s right the big fire at Arnott’s.	1174.021157573755
Val
Dillon was lord mayor.	894.7887085673382
The Glencree dinner.	592.3640888758189
Alderman Robert O’Reilly
emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell.	1386.1068978507267
Bobbob lapping it
for the inner alderman.	1234.077831024578
Couldn’t hear what the band played.	1373.754149046715
For what we
have already received may the Lord make us.	1191.2519076627743
Milly was a kiddy then.	1376.574856495803
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs.	1625.977254904392
Mantailored
with selfcovered buttons.	1196.3022706333559
She didn’t like it because I sprained my
ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	1210.5451301115502
As if that.	946.3981283460492
Old
Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	1538.178297537531
Flies’ picnic too.	946.4336915828404
Never put a dress on her back like it.	1392.130541945322
Fitted her like a glove,
shoulders and hips.	1547.8764631696781
Just beginning to plump it out well.	1616.8603167651788
Rabbitpie we
had that day.	1185.19614074123
People looking after her.	899.5670751284348
Happier then.	592.3640888758189
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	1371.6243377435765
Dockrell’s, one and ninepence a dozen.	1053.7480994922062
Milly’s tubbing night.	1196.3022706333559
American
soap I bought: elderflower.	784.6746171349943
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	1376.5449692291884
Funny she
looked soaped all over.	1250.4470473524461
Shapely too.	592.3640888758189
Now photography.	592.3640888758189
Poor papa’s
daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	1418.8315247665685
Hereditary taste.	592.3640888758189
He walked along the curbstone.	751.1376179153683
Stream of life.	423.53599958878664
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was
always squinting in when he passed?	1667.513856394357
Weak eyes, woman.	946.4336915828404
Stopped in
Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade.	643.030795245561
Pen something.	592.3640888758189
My memory is
getting.	1196.3022706333559
Of course it’s years ago.	1034.146369190673
Noise of the trams
probably.	1376.0023806314257
Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he
sees every day.	1324.0787627308873
Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	1376.7638163564666
Seeing her home
after practice.	1376.8572642759873
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	1511.7781851084778
Gave her
that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	1029.5912785462026
He and I behind.	592.3640888758189
Sheet of
her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	1212.8908043687716
Lucky
it didn’t.	676.4725966979438
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	1410.4517126884411
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	1055.917918848848
Shaky on his pins, poor old
sot.	1452.606028857262
His farewell concerts.	946.4336915828404
Positively last appearance on any stage.	1512.1281636973083
May be for months and may be for never.	1626.5220118363181
Remember her laughing at the
wind, her blizzard collar up.	1569.9039168238476
Corner of Harcourt road remember that
gust.	1082.0045774965577
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old
Goodwin.	1406.8972692785667
She did get flushed in the wind.	964.6951007567108
Remember when we got home
raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her
supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	1811.21048159056
And the mulled rum.	1196.3022706333559
Could see
her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays:
white.	1641.6076910574457
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	1233.1505903661832
Always warm from her.	899.5211824532328
Always liked to let her self out.	1373.757627138399
Sitting there after till near two
taking out her hairpins.	1823.833653464568
Milly tucked up in beddyhouse.	1185.3619550948083
That was the night...	590.833356174476
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	445.6171384831166
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	457.685823611329
—No use complaining.	946.4336915828404
How is Molly those times?	675.4879437573965
Haven’t seen her for
ages.	1177.9506756143444
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	650.6169669697325
Milly has a position down in
Mullingar, you know.	851.591028781109
—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?	891.0771994046667
In a photographer’s there.	1185.275659388198
Getting on like a house on fire.	1373.575454991226
How
are all your charges?	1376.8194724804155
—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.	870.7043910704755
How many has she?	1196.2896282679212
No other in sight.	991.9518981561401
—You’re in black, I see.	748.7479444462082
You have no...	737.2597686523128
—No, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
I have just come from a funeral.	1305.1251336653174
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	1003.5284711313369
Who’s dead, when and what did he
die of?	1375.4845113600034
Turn up like a bad penny.	1106.7602145515668
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	592.3640888758189
I hope it wasn’t any near relation.	1327.5338184318248
May as well get her sympathy.	1512.1510457806367
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
An old friend of mine.	771.1599277907824
He died quite suddenly,
poor fellow.	1250.4311867889585
Heart trouble, I believe.	592.3640888758189
Funeral was this morning.	673.9940753187502
Your funeral’s tomorrow
	1196.3022706333559
While you’re coming through the rye.	1373.5771880063708
Diddlediddle dumdum
	592.3640888758189
—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.	1196.2426563015954
Now that’s quite enough about that.	1124.9126253553518
Just: quietly: husband.	946.4336915828404
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes.	1298.6062561548351
Hasn’t lost them anyhow.	1376.8650244983396
—O, don’t be talking! she said.	635.6869154136144
He’s in
there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	1605.9834290944577
He has me
heartscalded.	1196.2980565823646
Wait till I show you.	624.6714892490231
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
out from Harrison’s.	1462.3637252610672
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s
gullet.	901.2832974435524
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
or they’d taste it with the hot tea.	1534.4558064700352
Or is it from her?	943.5787437977064
A barefoot arab
stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	1871.280401175832
Pleasure or pain is it?	742.8795113022187
Penny dinner.	592.3640888758189
Knife and fork
chained to the table.	811.7226355030024
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	1376.861144421135
Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
those things.	1062.1600452817704
Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram.	1823.88942192263
Please take one.	946.4248011905848
Devils if they lose sixpence.	1376.8321562397268
Raise Cain.	592.3640888758189
Husband barging.	592.3640888758189
Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday?	903.0484151837326
Are
you feeding your little brother’s family?	1548.0874797035813
Soiled handkerchief:
medicinebottle.	946.4336915828404
Pastille that was fell.	1196.3876451823944
What is she?...	593.4838720831418
—There must be a new moon out, she said.	617.5885253569144
He’s always bad then.	1185.2622976491991
Do you
know what he did last night?	706.5624705808453
Her hand ceased to rummage.	1376.853384062898
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
alarm, yet smiling.	1632.8070959530298
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
Let her speak.	946.4336915828404
Look straight in her eyes.	688.5477152723593
I believe you.	946.4259588536014
Trust me.	592.3640888758189
—Woke me up in the night, she said.	606.524169001301
Dream he had, a nightmare.	759.4812526496328
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	1148.7387275550313
—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	615.2681500540504
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	1699.9615428937877
—Read that, she said.	461.1495537703509
He got it this morning.	870.0498309504961
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	1055.840873726838
p: up, she said.	632.9069259590752
Someone taking a rise out of him.	740.406479269182
It’s a great
shame for them whoever he is.	1316.0816664048307
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office.	760.1658593313564
He’s going to take an
action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	1204.560828286172
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	1795.6356731078738
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	1911.270005380988
Seen
its best days.	1196.3022706333559
Wispish hair over her ears.	1185.2306334248585
And that dowdy toque: three
old grapes to take the harm out of it.	1062.8690414431253
Shabby genteel.	592.3640888758189
She used to be a
tasty dresser.	771.4574187643153
Lines round her mouth.	803.3364034539987
Only a year or so older than
Molly.	991.9685344755236
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	1700.0341182722677
The unfair sex.	946.4336915828404
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	1911.2792801086146
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	1196.3022706333559
I’m hungry too.	1196.2980565823646
Flakes of
pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her
cheek.	2047.3670046356435
Josie
Powell that was.	527.290393164424
In Luke Doyle’s long ago.	600.6794316909053
Dolphin’s Barn, the
charades.	675.4898473128194
p: up.	261.28801817388336
Change the subject.	737.2788882654531
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	767.1091935164742
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
—Mina Purefoy?	592.3640888758189
she said.	235.53953191350524
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	624.6780198066646
Playgoers’ Club.	592.3640888758189
Matcham often thinks of
the masterstroke.	1039.1651465579278
Did I pull the chain?	770.2718630767755
The last act.	946.4292464214541
—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.	1397.5136192887512
She’s in the
lying-in hospital in Holles street.	830.4231026296363
Dr Horne got her in.	1039.4008893717898
She’s three
days bad now.	1512.1210612500947
—O, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
I’m sorry to hear that.	797.3077735438612
—Yes, Mrs Breen said.	592.3640888758189
And a houseful of kids at home.	1260.0123553610374
It’s a very stiff
birth, the nurse told me.	1496.2676126122835
—O, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	1616.8260600451579
His tongue clacked in
compassion.	1376.8650244983396
Dth! Dth!
	592.3640888758189
—I’m sorry to hear that, he said.	545.5302376248901
Poor thing! Three days! That’s
terrible for her.	728.4235718737169
Mrs Breen nodded.	592.3640888758189
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	1082.011111806425
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
	1426.1131295590228
—Mind! Let this man pass.	1039.41860477134
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	1950.52609184107
Tight as a
skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	1440.8515852361215
From his arm a folded dustcoat,
a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.	1905.2678793464268
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He always walks outside the lampposts.	1512.1006773231668
—Who is he if it’s a fair question?	1110.9187466044464
Mrs Breen asked.	592.3640888758189
Is he dotty?	946.4336915828404
—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr
Bloom said smiling.	603.7062944328009
—He has enough of them, she said.	937.6956899814872
Denis will be like that one of these
days.	914.9979030705956
She broke off suddenly.	1196.2896282679212
—There he is, she said.	745.9738350118296
I must go after him.	1001.2037846146583
Remember me to
Molly, won’t you?	531.4466867638754
—I will, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	1626.4491747861543
Denis
Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of
Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	1560.0694703162815
Blown in from the bay.	770.8126291322426
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and
thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he
spoke earnestly.	2082.774908411943
Off his chump.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.	1696.2586220143653
Going the two
days.	1196.1925999129141
One way of getting on in the world.	689.6042873058502
And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds.	1767.7299624994537
Hard time she must have
with him.	876.8031579312716
p: up.	261.28801817388336
I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.	946.426986998457
Round to Menton’s
office.	624.6600097194489
His oyster eyes staring at the postcard.	1452.4994974420663
Be a feast for the
gods.	1159.2600302406693
There might be other answers lying there.	1616.7610321758502
Like to answer them all.	946.937185079625
Good system for criminals.	1196.3022706333559
At their
lunch now.	1196.3022706333559
Clerk with the glasses there doesn’t know me.	1111.85756229661
O, leave them
there to simmer.	1334.6214160909285
Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them.	1137.0055439894534
Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work.	1115.239335668816
I called
you naughty darling because I do not like that other world.	711.1099869951946
Please tell
me what is the meaning.	783.6077283867323
Please tell me what perfume does your wife.	609.8239564531625
Tell me who made the world.	924.908766819781
The way they spring those questions on you.	1366.7923953978432
And the other one Lizzie Twigg.	619.1828115854634
My literary efforts have had the good
fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A.	1435.0838268189013
(Mr Geo.	592.3640888758189

Our gracious and popular vicereine.	1376.861144421135
Bought the _Irish
Field_ now.	592.3640888758189
Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement
and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement
yesterday at Rathoath.	1264.3822347623448
Uneatable fox.	592.3640888758189
Pothunters too.	592.3640888758189
Fear injects
juices make it tender enough for them.	1280.2798661045083
Riding astride.	592.3640888758189
Sit her horse
like a man.	800.2395947460551
Weightcarrying huntress.	592.3640888758189
No sidesaddle or pillion for her,
not for Joe.	1293.4359912559557
First to the meet and in at the death.	1625.7875243680433
Strong as a brood
mare some of those horsey women.	1627.036186547285
Swagger around livery stables.	1196.2980565823661
Toss
off a glass of brandy neat while you’d say knife.	1635.335685687851
That one at the
Grosvenor this morning.	572.9948347157613
Up with her on the car: wishswish.	1304.8787627419583
Stonewall or
fivebarred gate put her mount to it.	1456.1303367756868
Who is this she was like?	1177.9334551212942
O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that
sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel.	1196.287286913418
Divorced Spanish American.	592.3640888758189
Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling
them.	1462.236888840169
As if I was her clotheshorse.	946.4070179453864
Saw her in the viceregal party when
Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._
Scavenging what the quality left.	1079.3271263629515
High tea.	592.3640888758189
Mayonnaise I poured on the
plums thinking it was custard.	1584.5569763467536
Her ears ought to have tingled for a few
weeks after.	1288.817736990848
Born courtesan.	592.3640888758189
No nursery work
for her, thanks.	1512.0634330920236
Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband.	592.3640888758189
Method in his madness.	1196.2130395977474
Saffron bun
and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy.	1748.2082404622674
Eating
with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute.	1766.4450295977601
And still his
muttonchop whiskers grew.	1512.1281635529294
Supposed to be well connected.	1376.7470266108558
Theodore’s
cousin in Dublin Castle.	748.7545201171381
One tony relative in every family.	1512.0961998790804
Hardy
annuals he presents her with.	1512.1438898891342
Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers
marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a
marketnet.	1395.0228207757098
The squallers.	592.3640888758189
Poor thing! Then having to give the breast
year after year all hours of the night.	1085.5890991970189
Selfish those t.t’s are.	1512.1352658891194
Dog in
the manger.	1196.9347039177337
Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.	1298.1840535942645
He stood at Fleet street crossing.	748.7545201171381
Luncheon interval.	592.3640888758189
A sixpenny at
Rowe’s?	592.3640888758189
Must look up that ad in the national library.	1033.0864907116522
An eightpenny in
the Burton.	784.6746171349943
On my way.	528.9653583798028
He walked on past Bolton’s Westmoreland house.	706.1528047397529
I forgot
to tap Tom Kernan.	748.7457280107576
Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a
vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out.	1560.2452953761244
Phew!
Dreadful simply! Child’s head too big: forceps.	1106.4002259761592
Doubled up inside her
trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out.	1933.7123303535184
Kill me
that would.	991.8862959832114
Lucky Molly got over hers lightly.	1196.2994612643795
They ought to invent
something to stop that.	1548.0838021212294
Life with hard labour.	1196.2980565823646
Twilight sleep idea:
queen Victoria was given that.	1003.508351843077
Nine she had.	647.0996608953984
A good layer.	946.4336915828404
Old woman
that lived in a shoe she had so many children.	1584.4933355115488
Suppose he was
consumptive.	1196.467209730809
Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the
what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence.	1488.9394584446109
Flapdoodle to
feed fools on.	1376.85051431677
They could easily have big establishments whole thing
quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at
compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings
and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage
people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years
want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.	2002.4808224546146
Not stillborn of course.	674.0917838022579
They are not even registered.	1376.7847097440904
Trouble for
nothing.	593.5229010712899
Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out.	1557.365119036957
Molly and Mrs
Moisel.	592.3640888758189
Mothers’ meeting.	592.3640888758189
Phthisis retires for the time being, then
returns.	1278.1626665099886
How flat they look all of a sudden after.	1304.3214122860277
Peaceful eyes.	592.3640888758189
Weight off their mind.	1196.2938424605543
Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul.	1196.13205177399
All my
babies, she said.	746.0112373891552
The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them.	1686.741950583754
O,
that’s nyumnyum.	1196.6359222387246
Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall’s son.	862.001825092901
His first
bow to the public.	818.3708532328279
Head like a prize pumpkin.	1376.572511268439
Snuffy Dr Murren.	592.3640888758189
People
knocking them up at all hours.	1452.7657224057298
For God’ sake, doctor.	841.8114424048898
Wife in her
throes.	1196.1352779461065
Then keep them waiting months for their fee.	1700.0125489420445
To attendance on
your wife.	1040.611556623787
No gratitude in people.	1196.2938425462191
Humane doctors, most of them.	669.562157957352
Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of
pigeons flew.	1209.614111492265
Their little frolic after meals.	1096.1128238240594
Who will we do it on?	1034.0216761962984
I
pick the fellow in black.	1033.9994738141843
Here goes.	592.3640888758189
Here’s good luck.	991.975450508825
Must be
thrilling from the air.	776.0286368474666
Mackerel they called me.	1196.2791809973808
A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
file.	946.430357642071
Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their
truncheons.	1616.8260600451579
After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their
belts.	1636.655588087977
Policeman’s lot is oft a happy one.	1700.0619005235242
They split up in groups and
scattered, saluting, towards their beats.	1871.12742498243
Let out to graze.	1196.3486723831647
Best moment
to attack one in pudding time.	1700.043746652667
A punch in his dinner.	1376.775104974903
A squad of
others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the
station.	1180.4240422292355
Bound for their troughs.	1196.2275046492878
Prepare to receive cavalry.	1196.3052479685487
Prepare
to receive soup.	1196.3052479685487
He crossed under Tommy Moore’s roguish finger.	841.8114424048898
They did right to put
him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters.	1390.5366238616546
Ought to be places for
women.	1512.0237220672166
Running into cakeshops.	946.4336915828404
Settle my hat straight.	1196.2907257625654
_There is not in
this wide world a vallee_.	1557.3255139536934
Great song of Julia Morkan’s.	592.3640888758189
Kept her voice
up to the very last.	1003.6801022682462
He gazed after the last broad tunic.	1452.5605540299237
Nasty customers to tackle.	1196.3022706333559
Jack
Power could a tale unfold: father a G man.	894.7836326480882
If a fellow gave them
trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the
bridewell.	1962.434956190053
Can’t blame them after all with the job they have especially
the young hornies.	1904.9964484887432
That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was
given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money.	1065.702074999035
My word he did!
His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street.	1082.011111806425
Lucky I had
the presence of mind to dive into Manning’s or I was souped.	937.471726542698
He did
come a wallop, by George.	1082.0111118507
Must have cracked his skull on the
cobblestones.	1409.4458963314312
I oughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those
medicals.	1441.2045103543467
And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards.	1081.8721500052907
Looking for
trouble.	946.4336915828404
Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting
for me in the Mater and now he’s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy.	843.3936987654681
Wheels within wheels.	946.4336915828404
Police whistle in my ears still.	1511.9991511418486
All skedaddled.	592.3640888758189
Why he fixed on me.	1096.0663849097289
Give me in charge.	1196.3258288920813
Right here it began.	1196.2938425462191
—Up the Boers!
	592.3640888758189
—Three cheers for De Wet!
	592.3640888758189
—We’ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.	946.3117861752509
Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out.	1823.8528753617236
Vinegar hill.	592.3640888758189
The Butter exchange band.	841.8114424048898
Few years’ time half of them magistrates and
civil servants.	1692.1740625317825
War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows
used to.	1747.741179097171
Never know who you’re talking to.	1172.8034004617325
Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in
his eye.	541.641588857036
Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on
the invincibles.	988.6832574389784
Member of the corporation too.	1000.628575957191
Egging raw youths on to
get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the
castle.	1461.5391373950945
Drop him like a hot potato.	1130.2655524243366
Why those plainclothes men are
always courting slaveys.	1700.0619005235242
Easily twig a man used to uniform.	1452.7806208144498
Squarepushing up against a backdoor.	1376.8444847922087
Maul her a bit.	698.0900630075746
Then the next
thing on the menu.	1305.0166909461088
And who is the gentleman does be visiting there?	1339.645080638272
Was
the young master saying anything?	1512.121052825528
Decoy duck.	592.3640888758189
Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms
ironing.	1767.7453340021673
—Are those yours, Mary?	592.3640888758189
—I don’t wear such things...	1512.5368497603883
Stop or I’ll tell the missus on you.	1065.43438518987
Out
half the night.	590.9372932326837
—There are great times coming, Mary.	835.3443959785761
Wait till you see.	638.3423961604944
—Ah, gelong with your great times coming.	1452.6785948856298
Barmaids too.	592.3640888758189
James Stephens’ idea was the best.	931.7493902398566
He knew them.	946.4336915828404
Circles of ten so that
a fellow couldn’t round on more than his own ring.	1760.8979747756605
Sinn Fein.	592.3640888758189
Back out
you get the knife.	1512.0721506940536
Hidden hand.	592.3640888758189
Stay in.	592.3640888758189
The firing squad.	946.4336915828404
Turnkey’s
daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk.	890.3581290966655
Putting up in the
Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses.	866.7549200721957
You must have a certain fascination: Parnell.	972.110889262428
Arthur Griffith is a
squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob.	1549.5669038679298
Or gas about
our lovely land.	1512.1317147529485
Gammon and spinach.	946.4336915828404
Dublin Bakery Company’s tearoom.	784.6746171349943
Debating societies.	592.3640888758189
That republicanism is the best form of government.	1547.7858332156825
That the language question should take precedence of the economic
question.	1870.5464478218041
Have your daughters inveigling them to your house.	1548.040565040035
Stuff them
up with meat and drink.	1323.7476861902117
Michaelmas goose.	592.3640888758189
Here’s a good lump of thyme
seasoning under the apron for you.	1358.3809626441596
Have another quart of goosegrease
before it gets too cold.	1823.8374559028748
Halffed enthusiasts.	592.3640888758189
Penny roll and a walk
with the band.	1698.9907956177458
No grace for the carver.	1376.3718741385921
The thought that the other chap
pays best sauce in the world.	1047.2931118006343
Show
us over those apricots, meaning peaches.	1616.8195510492678
The not far distant day.	1376.8572643548625
Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	572.3788226518145
His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,
shadowing Trinity’s surly front.	1383.0326551576236
Trams passed one another, ingoing,
outgoing, clanging.	1616.816940059365
Useless words.	592.3640888758189
Things go on same, day after day:
squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out.	1933.9318748797002
Those two loonies
mooching about.	1376.861144421135
Dignam carted off.	946.4336915828404
Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed
groaning to have a child tugged out of her.	1062.66277695078
One born every second
somewhere.	1376.8533842206493
Other dying every second.	1196.2938424605543
Since I fed the birds five
minutes.	1322.6532090119752
Three hundred kicked the bucket.	773.1431807560381
Other three hundred born,
washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling
maaaaaa.	1156.1003931310336
Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other
coming on, passing on.	1873.4181291579143
Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of
pavements, piledup bricks, stones.	1871.063108443769
Changing hands.	592.3640888758189
This owner, that.	946.4336915828404
Landlord never dies they say.	849.9160638177934
Other steps into his shoes when he gets
his notice to quit.	1738.0606238420332
They buy the place up with gold and still they have
all the gold.	1430.1832917712516
Swindle in it somewhere.	1196.2742931366695
Piled up in cities, worn away
age after age.	1767.8348503889613
Pyramids in sand.	737.2943990675084
Built on bread and onions.	1020.3451701017515
Slaves

Big stones left.	946.4336915828404
Round towers.	592.3640888758189
Rest rubble,
sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt.	1376.8650244983396
Kerwan’s mushroom houses built of
breeze.	1616.8260600451579
Shelter, for the night.	478.3784803987857
No-one is anything.	1196.2654392300192
This is the very worst hour of the day.	920.0543406017904
Dull, gloomy: hate
this hour.	1376.8572642759873
Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.	1106.3457589783118
Provost’s house.	489.3760468232734
The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon.	748.7527617590957
Well tinned in
there.	991.9674364358041
Like a mortuary chapel.	991.9824392102742
Wouldn’t live in it if they paid me.	1767.693853655972
Hope they have liver and bacon today.	1452.6674670330387
Nature abhors a vacuum.	1196.3022706333559
The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the
silverware opposite in Walter Sexton’s window by which John Howard
Parnell passed, unseeing.	1332.8886492362205
There he is: the brother.	895.6342427879623
Image of him.	397.801619384629
Haunting face.	592.3640888758189
Now that’s a
coincidence.	833.0752323079605
Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don’t
meet him.	1360.3910451675765
Like a man walking in his sleep.	1305.2652527376813
No-one knows him.	1196.2980565823661
Must be a
corporation meeting today.	1511.976361103475
They say he never put on the city marshal’s
uniform since he got the job.	1421.907476295779
Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his
high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved.	1649.3810690466003
Look at the
woebegone walk of him.	1115.0027636861878
Eaten a bad egg.	1196.2968198958201
Poached eyes on ghost.	1196.2898040280031
I have a
pain.	1196.1642261815962
Great man’s brother: his brother’s brother.	1366.742743931139
He’d look nice on the
city charger.	1547.8156852746247
Drop into the D.B.C.	592.3640888758189
probably for his coffee, play chess
there.	2415.762504403644
His brother used men as pawns.	1512.1317147529485
Let them all go to pot.	1334.588313224593
Afraid to
pass a remark on him.	1154.7262213128345
Freeze them up with that eye of his.	979.1583222320728
That’s the
fascination: the name.	1070.5291421433126
All a bit touched.	1196.3284762695487
Mad Fanny and his other
sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness.	1069.793119774245
Bolt upright
like surgeon M’Ardle.	748.7545201171381
Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath.	841.830858431019
Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life.	964.3966850117945
The
patriot’s banquet.	1196.3022706333559
Eating orangepeels in the park.	757.074979546972
Simon Dedalus said
when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the
grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.	1154.2500924635644
—Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which
the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks
with a Scotch accent.	1475.8206683973997
The tentacles...	592.3640888758189
They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone.	767.1912949262155
Beard and
bicycle.	946.4292464214541
Young woman.	592.3640888758189
And there he is too.	717.1158181143539
Now that’s really a coincidence: second time.	1700.2899756413058
Coming events cast their shadows before.	1512.1352658891194
With the approval of the
eminent poet, Mr Geo.	792.8169672096082
That might be Lizzie Twigg with him.	513.0337863595353
E.: what does that mean?	713.1535737398015
Initials perhaps.	592.3640888758189
Albert Edward, Arthur
Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire.	592.3640888758189
What was he saying?	1196.231631609959
The ends of the
world with a Scotch accent.	608.0522167022206
Tentacles: octopus.	592.3640888758189
Something occult:
symbolism.	946.4336915828404
Holding forth.	592.3640888758189
She’s taking it all in.	1103.6142473340074
Not saying a word.	729.4776968733973
To
aid gentleman in literary work.	805.5295343220847
His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a
listening woman at his side.	1590.1896403109506
Coming from the vegetarian.	1195.6026603819735
Only
weggebobbles and fruit.	991.9824392102742
Don’t eat a beefsteak.	1185.26563874285
If you do the eyes of
that cow will pursue you through all eternity.	1671.858180368945
Windandwatery though.	592.3640888758189
Tried it.	592.3640888758189
Keep you on the run all day.	1124.5239489525336
Dreams all night.	647.1690971058431
Why do they call that thing they gave me
nutsteak?	1509.8116908566003
To give you the idea you are eating
rumpsteak.	1481.0127933361912
Salty too.	592.3640888758189
They cook in soda.	1196.3022706333559
Keep you sitting by
the tap all night.	1222.1194835653669
Her stockings are loose over her ankles.	1616.7821887167531
I detest that: so tasteless.	1376.8955107352617
Those literary etherial people they are all.	1616.73023673136
Dreamy, cloudy,
symbolistic.	946.4336915828404
Esthetes they are.	507.1236870126373
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that
kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.	1645.6301887334319
For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their
shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him.	1042.8966155023818
Don’t know
what poetry is even.	1202.591209697134
Must be in a certain mood.	1196.9437513766206
The dreamy cloudy gull
	1196.2980565823646
Waves o’er the waters dull.	655.7340457429793
He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of
Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses.	956.4913789873824
Or will I drop into old
Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair?	963.2939482415899
Wellmannered fellow.	592.3640888758189
Probably at his lunch.	1196.184396579453
Must get those old glasses of mine set right.	1767.7253216743304
Goerz lenses six guineas.	1196.3022706333559
Germans making their way everywhere.	1376.8543945801118
Sell on
easy terms to capture trade.	1452.7275516045595
Might chance on a pair in
the railway lost property office.	1748.0857925011694
Astonishing the things people leave
behind them in trains and cloakrooms.	1871.057675915031
Women too.	592.3640888758189
Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up
that farmer’s daughter’s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.	1382.4690688386281
Unclaimed money too.	737.2943990675084
There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the
bank to test those glasses by.	1813.895530641626
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides.	1354.0501913320254
Can’t see it.	676.4561610145998
If
you imagine it’s there you can almost see it.	1575.8850303861873
Can’t see it.	676.4561610145998
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right
hand at arm’s length towards the sun.	1515.9838550424563
Wanted to try that often.	1376.8328431619627
Yes:
completely.	592.3640888758189
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk.	1353.7320743181106
Must be the focus where the rays cross.	1699.8932973901299
If I had black glasses.	1039.41860477134
There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were
in Lombard street west.	914.641652767577
Looking up from the back garden.	1086.921726888193
Terrific
explosions they are.	749.2188667155672
There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn
some time.	1491.3235718885653
Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time.	879.7488382386733
It’s
the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink.	1512.0142665130127
Must go out there
some first Saturday of the month.	910.3835149228923
If I could get an introduction to
professor Joly or learn up something about his family.	1327.990495871004
That would do
to: man always feels complimented.	1700.038725479497
Flattery where least expected.	1196.3022706333559
Nobleman proud to be descended from some king’s mistress.	1823.7356096693045
His
foremother.	592.3640888758189
Lay it on with a trowel.	1249.7492115689215
Cap in hand goes through the land.	1323.5891887534328
Not go in and blurt out what you know you’re not to: what’s parallax?	1630.8636521461974
Show this gentleman the door.	833.1330428223686
His hand fell to his side again.	1616.5190150522253
Never know anything about it.	861.9140178536181
Waste of time.	556.5673062970346
Gasballs spinning about,
crossing each other, passing.	1616.805469432904
Same old dingdong always.	1196.2980565823646
The moon.	592.3640888758189
Must be a new moon out, she
said.	658.0700561373535
I believe there is.	992.0206814900406
He went on by la maison Claire.	1081.9882137663328
The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly
there is a new moon.	1020.6653133504649
Walking down by the Tolka.	675.4879437573957
Not bad for a Fairview
moon.	748.7474864952692
The young May moon she’s beaming, love.	1196.284428387212
He other
side of her.	427.5431471285928
Elbow, arm.	592.3640888758189
Glowworm’s la-amp is gleaming, love.	1616.8260600451579
If it was it was.	592.9802273506886
Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.	841.8114424048898
With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here
middle of the day of Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders.	1254.8188757669109
They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la
femme_.	1364.3303144716042
Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the
rest of the year sober as a judge.	1184.6051678357294
Thought so.	592.3640888758189
Sloping into the Empire.	592.3640888758189
Plain soda would do him
good.	1512.1158084430656
Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
Queen’s.	592.3640888758197

Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts.	1616.7942525152898
Drinkers, drinking,
laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath.	1767.7688841065128
More power, Pat.	592.3640888758189
Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke.	1700.0678893036218
Take off that white
hat.	1376.8466344176697
His parboiled eyes.	946.4336915828404
Where is he now?	676.4780872793324
Beggar somewhere.	592.3640888758189
I was happier then.	991.9824392102742
Or was that I?	592.3640888758189
Or am I now I?	592.3640888758189
Twentyeight I was.	592.3640888758189
She twentythree.	592.3640888758189
When we left Lombard street west something changed.	1003.5302386325047
Could never like it again after Rudy.	1082.003964930977
Can’t bring back time.	1376.8572642759873
Like
holding water in your hand.	1334.594182847541
Would you go back to then?	1512.1231466657318
Just beginning
then.	946.4336915828404
Would you?	592.3640888758189
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty
boy?	776.8158371419055
I must answer.	737.2943990675084
Write it in the
library.	749.5580224202953
Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses.	1626.573501986189
Muslin prints,
silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in
the baking causeway.	1976.7118222225974
Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.	1626.9243093821494
Countrybred chawbacon.	592.3640888758189
All the beef

Always gives a woman clumsy feet.	1512.144462328151
Molly looks out

He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers.	964.3858138414163
Cascades of ribbons.	946.4336915828404
Flimsy China silks.	592.3640888758189
A tilted urn poured from its
mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood.	1873.4124707911851
The huguenots
brought that here.	1185.2789995483442
_La causa è santa!_ Tara tara.	885.1516420694318
Great chorus that.	946.4336915828404
Taree tara.	592.3640888758189
Must be washed in rainwater.	1376.8775598476043
Tara: bom bom bom.	1196.2938425462191
I’m a long time threatening to buy one.	1496.550870533638
Sticking them all
over the place.	761.1579017882132
Needles in window curtains.	1196.2938425462191
He bared slightly his left forearm.	1512.1380368152245
Scrape: nearly gone.	946.4336915828404
Not today
anyhow.	946.4336915828404
Must go back for that lotion.	917.6431998862312
For her birthday perhaps.	1196.3022706333559
Junejulyaugseptember eighth.	592.3640888758189
Nearly three months off.	1196.299154040122
Then she mightn’t

Women won’t pick up pins.	1512.0972370705076
Say it cuts lo.	991.9824392102742
Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk
stockings.	1795.6847011785278
Useless to go back.	822.6144418282493
Had to be.	440.3347891755505
Tell me all.	737.2883752415042

Sunwarm silk.	592.3640888758189
Jingling harnesses.	592.3640888758189

Wealth of the world.	267.22317764371184
A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain.	1253.8872288381106
His brain yielded.	946.4336915828404
Perfume of embraces all him assailed.	1512.138816961438
With hungered flesh obscurely, he
mutely craved to adore.	1767.7688841065128
Duke street.	592.3640888758189
Here we are.	737.2496272478201

The Burton.	592.3640888758189
Feel better then.	946.4336915828404
He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued.	1082.0141894979386
Jingling, hoofthuds.	592.3640888758189
Perfumed bodies, warm, full.	1196.3022706333559
All kissed, yielded: in deep summer
fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements,
along sofas, creaking beds.	2083.6665577745503
—Jack, love!
	592.3640888758189
—Kiss me, Reggy!
	592.3640888758189
—My boy!
	592.3640888758189
His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant.	667.5327182194291
Stink
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens.	1823.8605849571838
See
the animals feed.	1196.3022706333559
Men, men, men.	946.4292464214541
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables
calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy
food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches.	2153.58404723035
A pallid suetfaced
young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.	1905.2524110226113
New set of microbes.	1196.2854142614635
A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked
round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet.	2047.6141204279033
A man spitting back

Chump chop from the grill.	1376.2169443449359
Bolting to get it over.	742.0465441589507
Sad booser’s

Bitten off more than he can chew.	1373.7588829510712
Am I like that?	407.9530908455307
See ourselves

Hungry man is an angry man.	1512.0962019728613
Working tooth and jaw.	1196.2938424605543
Don’t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the
schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne.	908.7288806342484
Wonder what
he was eating.	1040.7285299692514
Something galoptious.	592.3640888758189
Saint Patrick converted him to
Christianity.	748.7545201171381
Couldn’t swallow it all however.	1512.082684554009
—Roast beef and cabbage.	991.9754506693862
—One stew.	592.3640888758189
Smells of men.	556.565372927366
Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek
of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment.	2083.635650277774
His gorge rose.	946.4336915828404
Couldn’t eat a morsel here.	1334.6332300871036
Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
before him, old chap picking his tootles.	1856.4028001012014
Slight spasm, full, chewing
the cud.	1334.6426329393778
Before and after.	737.25374388456
Grace after meals.	647.1873352442567
Look on this picture then

Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread.	1548.0759758711563
Lick it
off the plate, man! Get out of this.	878.4547269482738
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of
his nose.	1420.446202566817
—Two stouts here.	946.4336915828404
—One corned and cabbage.	991.9789449784407
That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended
on it.	1755.4863296451836
Good stroke.	592.3640888758189
Give me the fidgets to look.	1177.9164271636664
Safer to eat from his
three hands.	1616.6889717382603
Tear it limb from limb.	1020.3543853069771
Second nature to him.	674.0627585382766
Born with a
silver knife in his mouth.	1064.468269115808
That’s witty, I think.	592.3640888758189
Or no.	592.3640888758189
Silver means
born rich.	1196.3022706333559
Born with a knife.	991.1521596087573
But then the allusion is lost.	1197.407077841472
An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates.	1616.8260600451579
Rock, the head
bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.	1640.6095774711523
Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot.	1548.0874796625844
A diner, knife and fork
upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the
foodlift across his stained square of newspaper.	2049.0542098653245
Other chap telling him
something with his mouth full.	1626.2719987385417
Sympathetic listener.	592.3640888758189

Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips.	981.5897359007963
His eyes said:
	946.4336915828404
—Not here.	592.3640888758189
Don’t see him.	1196.2132373152874
I hate dirty eaters.	1196.3022706333559
He backed towards the door.	629.6006158217338
Get a light snack in Davy Byrne’s.	841.8040287869233
Keep me going.	946.4336915828404
Had a good breakfast.	1196.18504242742
—Roast and mashed here.	1196.3022706333559
—Pint of stout.	737.2909362695849
Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail.	1547.862961451091
He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.	1263.5635277616136
Eat or be eaten.	1196.2980565823646
Kill! Kill!

Soup, joint and sweet.	991.9789449784407
Never know whose thoughts you’re

Then who’d wash up all the plates and forks?	1531.7141071238366

Like a few olives too if they had them.	1432.934774428021
Italian I prefer.	592.3640888758189
Good glass of
burgundy take away that.	1452.69766973843
A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,
Tom Kernan can dress.	1122.1355619645885
Puts gusto into it.	899.5734130032178

You may have heard

O, that’s the style.	660.4718174634879
Who’s getting it up?	548.3498536027017
The curate served.	946.4336915828404
—How much is that?	517.7988724962854
—Seven d., sir...	946.4336915828404
Thank you, sir.	507.19202448485635
_Mr MacTrigger_.	592.3640888758189
Easier

—Mustard, sir?	592.3640888758189
—Thank you.	592.3640888758189
He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs.	1700.070883610277
_Their lives_.	592.3640888758189
I have
it.	556.5523014973687
_It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.	1616.8162965611473
—Getting it up?	383.01190899943276
Well, it’s like a company idea, you see.	997.3557117667845
Part
shares and part profits.	878.3780628965003
Who is this was telling me?	847.7855795212722
Isn’t Blazes Boylan
mixed up in it?	675.9602606053719
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart.	1253.7277904291188
He
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock.	1411.4090396167876
Pub clock
five minutes fast.	1376.8572642759873
Time going on.	737.2858141838178
Hands moving.	592.3640888758189
His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,
longingly.	1911.359576832511
He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to
speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.	2066.5947292147484
No fear: no brains.	1196.2980565823646
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched.	1039.409817210504
Flea having a good square meal.	1334.535820235982
—He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that
boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello
barracks.	959.9091007891649
By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he
was telling me...	730.555981576553
Hope that dewdrop doesn’t come down into his glass.	1509.8162472386662
No, snuffled it up.	606.9913347490606
—For near a month, man, before it came off.	1767.733019836434
Sucking duck eggs by God
till further orders.	913.8141412908171
Keep him off the boose, see?	1334.47717635318
O, by God, Blazes is
a hairy chap.	1003.4276867634866
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin.	1787.9204143677641
Herring’s blush.	946.4336915828404
Whose
smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete.	1747.8795880229543
—And here’s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said.	1122.2359029910383
Can you give
us a good one for the Gold cup?	900.9694932263118
—I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered.	637.1946389063982
I never put anything on a
horse.	1452.4621839523086
—You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said.	724.1055721776142
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.	1994.5316582351863
Sips of his
wine soothed his palate.	1616.3918442769968
Not logwood that.	946.4336915828404
Tastes fuller this weather
with the chill off.	1699.386992644648
Nice quiet bar.	946.4336915828404
Nice piece of wood in that counter.	1616.6374084530548
Nicely planed.	592.3640888758189
Like
the way it curves there.	1197.499782771533
—I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said.	818.8003544320566
It ruined
many a man, the same horses.	1409.7005320112883
Vintners’ sweepstake.	592.3640888758189
Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
for consumption on the premises.	992.4720182252958
Heads I win tails you lose.	1196.2994612643795
—True for you, Nosey Flynn said.	592.3640888758189
Unless you’re in the know.	880.9553356092853
There’s no
straight sport going now.	1616.8105384419812
Lenehan gets some good ones.	1376.8572643548641
He’s giving
Sceptre today.	592.3640888758189
Zinfandel’s the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden’s, won
at Epsom.	748.7154788356802
Morny Cannon is riding him.	1039.41860477134
I could have got seven to one
against Saint Amant a fortnight before.	1091.9404846597733
Davy Byrne said...	592.3640888758189
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
its pages.	1591.689150148584
—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	650.6156573795939
That was a rare bit of
horseflesh.	1616.5397363737745
Saint Frusquin was her sire.	1039.3834517579185
She won in a thunderstorm,
Rothschild’s filly, with wadding in her ears.	1253.5134532421137
Blue jacket and yellow
cap.	1376.83786300434
Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O’Gaunt.	673.1130499389697
He put me off
it.	1185.263168366362
He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
flutes.	1911.17656242667
—Ay, he said, sighing.	1196.9306064700577
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	1426.0729373230108
Nosey numbskull.	592.3640888758189
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	752.0648807160959
He knows already.	946.4336915828404
Better let him
forget.	1196.2084873128751
Go and lose more.	1196.2980565823646
Fool and his money.	991.742273214262
Dewdrop coming down
again.	991.964967016193
Cold nose he’d have kissing a woman.	1129.4471873756436
Still they might like.	1196.2443679320163
Prickly beards they like.	991.9544837112767
Dogs’ cold noses.	946.4336915828404

Nice wine it is.	562.2210858172108
Taste it better because I’m not thirsty.	1003.5157718126568
Bath
of course does that.	1377.009440546155
Then about six o’clock I can.	885.1516420694318
Time will be gone then.	1376.8172363859317
Mild fire of wine kindled his veins.	1616.8097874722405
I wanted that badly.	1196.2980565823646
Felt so off
colour.	1196.2938425462191
His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy
lobsters’ claws.	1871.0774890473367
All the odd things people pick up for food.	1767.7446046286227
Out of
shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the
French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook.	1203.3919061493025
Silly fish learn
nothing in a thousand years.	1547.600196939387

Unsightly like a clot of phlegm.	1334.4126101295333
Filthy shells.	592.3640888758189
Devil to open them too.	1376.8592853082102
Who found them out?	843.0423946678915
Garbage, sewage they feed on.	1376.8572642759873

May I
tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat?	1288.6199739154856
Yes, do

And she did bedad.	1196.2905865351215
A miss Dubedat
lived in Killiney, I remember.	592.3640888758189
_Du de la_ is French.	784.6746171349943
Still it’s the

of making money hand over fist finger in fishes’ gills can’t write his

twisted.	1605.86063419549
Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.	1699.7579514827337
Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed.	1616.7153943643139
Crushing in the
winepress grapes of Burgundy.	1082.3422963905198
Sun’s heat it is.	752.5655433729361
Seems to a secret touch
telling me memory.	1547.8497692139338
Touched his sense moistened remembered.	1376.8650244983396
Hidden under
wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky.	1275.2360199416953
No sound.	592.3640888758189
The sky.	592.3640888758189
The
bay purple by the Lion’s head.	1003.4989931110821
Green by Drumleck.	592.3640888758189
Yellowgreen towards
Sutton.	592.3640888758189
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried
cities.	1871.0709227976706
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather
scrub my hand under her nape, you’ll toss me all.	1947.3414300586915
O wonder! Coolsoft
with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not
turn away.	1767.7061107033628
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and
chewed.	1406.449752956345
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	1823.6616696689216
Joy: I ate it: joy.	1039.4156756356856
Young life, her lips that gave me pouting.	1548.0583472379458
Soft
warm sticky gumjelly lips.	1376.8650244983396
Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing
eyes.	1474.1796488013454
Pebbles fell.	592.3640888758189
She lay still.	946.4336915828404
A goat.	592.3640888758189
No-one.	592.3640888758189
High on Ben Howth
rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.	1191.2775150095954
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	1512.1352658891174
Wildly I lay on her,
kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman’s breasts
full in her blouse of nun’s veiling, fat nipples upright.	1969.7544174172567
Hot I tongued
her.	841.8114424048898
She kissed me.	647.1889183956465
All yielding she tossed my hair.	1512.1281635529294
Kissed, she kissed me.	633.9529889900646
And me now.	593.517326024486
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	1196.2980565823661
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	1747.3638244662081
Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty.	1512.1352658891174
Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:
curves the world admires.	1003.5788027679673
Can see them library museum standing in the
round hall, naked goddesses.	1795.9789796765647
Aids to digestion.	946.4336915828404
They don’t care what
man looks.	1374.0932529513536
All to see.	416.3305656558464
Never speaking.	592.3640888758189
I mean to say to fellows like
Flynn.	991.9809618431584
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	987.612166805491
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	1322.5993552164925
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods
golden dishes, all ambrosial.	1823.8631548295793
Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled
mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	1660.5591556789423
Nectar imagine it
drinking electricity: gods’ food.	1616.8228055439354
Lovely forms of women sculped
Junonian.	946.4225782666924
Immortal lovely.	592.3640888758189
And we stuffing food in one hole and out
behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like
stoking an engine.	2148.868321619189
They have no.	737.2597686523128
Never looked.	592.3640888758189
I’ll look today.	1196.2980565823646
Keeper
won’t see.	699.0191546389792
Bend down let something fall see if she.	1700.0597886402638
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do
there to do.	1619.9527363253467
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	2212.2558687735764
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
	966.8991940200881
—What is this he is?	717.0756946888577
Isn’t he in the insurance line?	1305.6526864608786
—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	801.646303323223
He does canvassing for
the _Freeman._
	885.1498603158275
—I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	946.4228845186118
Is he in trouble?	1196.2738688492511
Nosey Flynn said.	592.3640888758189
Not that I heard of.	784.6663477905304
—I noticed he was in mourning.	600.4698911307449
—Was he?	592.3640888758189
Nosey Flynn said.	592.3640888758189
So he was, faith.	992.1192078951034
I asked him how was all at
home.	1244.5849264495569
You’re right, by God.	784.6701945885609
So he was.	489.4560147059871
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
gentleman is in trouble that way.	1103.9955687861489
It only brings it up fresh in their
minds.	1767.656922237675
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	946.3758825894895
I met him the day before
yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
to his better half.	1124.6781330612148
She’s well nourished, I tell you.	632.2036633397763
Plovers on toast.	946.4336915828404
—And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.	811.924188825453
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	656.8217157551796
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.	1870.8023627475052
You can make bacon of
that.	1055.827667675469
—How so?	592.3640888758189
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	1282.8206821378499
He
winked.	592.3640888758189
—He’s in the craft, he said.	686.0286240849925
—Do you tell me so?	1020.3243180957413
Davy Byrne said.	592.3640888758189
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	592.3640888758189
Ancient free and accepted order.	1376.8533842206493
He’s
an excellent brother.	1185.2556178427067
Light, life and love, by God.	946.4114646743503
They give him a leg
up.	822.551256434302
I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.	1115.145845961856
—Is that a fact?	460.66130657222766
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	612.1544048674294
They stick to you when you’re
down.	1237.546643651151
I know a fellow was trying to get into it.	1038.5234770450015
But they’re as close
as damn it.	1299.5497630621678
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	806.8110786157916
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
	1055.874384136658
—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
out what they do be doing.	1246.8229647642333
But be damned but they smelt her out and
swore her in on the spot a master mason.	1678.53007783007
That was one of the saint
Legers of Doneraile.	568.3608660379537
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
	1584.6537336215317
—And is that a fact?	441.32531932022874
Decent quiet man he is.	717.0827851915423
I often saw him in here
and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.	1429.6620090316262
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	987.570669547056
Slips
off when the fun gets too hot.	1699.9114711324019
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?	947.4685874218488
Ah, you weren’t there.	1376.8621549029606
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he
does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	1672.7029757491468
Declare to
God he does.	593.0503330955814
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	841.8114424048898
He’s a safe man, I’d say.	913.7366536587652
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	790.5153769389168
He’s been known
to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	1551.5999945362453
O,
Bloom has his good points.	1196.2713665096887
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.	1178.799129249158
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	1692.2058386026542
—I know, Davy Byrne said.	592.3640888758189
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	766.5545108271926
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	650.6124106099322
Tom Rochford followed frowning,
a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	1183.2406978223803
—Day, Mr Byrne.	592.3640888758189
—Day, gentlemen.	592.3640888758189
They paused at the counter.	713.011498601723
—Who’s standing?	946.4336915828404
Paddy Leonard asked.	592.3640888758189
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	724.1084873131331
—Well, what’ll it be?	1020.329253147843
Paddy Leonard asked.	592.3640888758189
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	833.7717706151168
—How much?	592.3640888758189
Paddy Leonard cried.	592.3640888758189
Since when, for God’ sake?	592.3640888758189
What’s
yours, Tom?	592.3640888758189
—How is the main drainage?	1376.556280551489
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
hiccupped.	926.3706500970625
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	903.3359641060183
—Certainly, sir.	592.3640888758189
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	1039.41860477134
—Lord love a duck, he said.	796.1548607245078
Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold
water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	1196.2703191543737
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	1344.9475256409892
A dead snip.	946.4336915828404
—Zinfandel is it?	338.4313499265509
Nosey Flynn asked.	592.3640888758189
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set
before him.	1647.5612199827697
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	1617.3056041175985
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	724.1026569353077
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	1039.4068881591584
—Is it Zinfandel?	592.3640888758189
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	592.3640888758189
I’m going to plunge five bob on my
own.	1268.006672137871
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
said.	1090.1689605292463
Who gave it to you?	485.7229553383519
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.	592.3640888758189
The others turned.	946.4336915828404
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.	789.6537286435195
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	835.3382316580655
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two
of your small Jamesons after that and a...	1376.613751851399
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	592.3640888758189
A suckingbottle for the baby.	943.248526452183
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
smooth.	1196.2731362750226
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	1074.757473405294
Then with
those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	1003.5087531667398
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	1906.9842182596672
Returned with thanks
having fully digested the contents.	1700.0678893036218
First sweet then savoury.	1196.3022706333559
Mr Bloom
coasted warily.	841.8114424048898
Their upper jaw they
move.	1376.861144421135
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of
his?	1015.4954044087816
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.	913.8109223236265
Lean people long
mouths.	1196.3022706333559
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and
invent free.	1631.9750972690213
Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.	1496.5671367357984
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
	1870.5445427000584
Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
	770.2827166624523
M’invitasti.	592.3640888758189
Feel better.	592.3640888758189
Good pick me up.	1196.268556242319
Who distilled first?	946.4336915828404
Some chap
in the blues.	927.2817278646767
Dutch courage.	592.3640888758189
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
library now I must.	646.9332430967133
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,
plumber, turned back his thoughts.	1044.0922009791334
They could: and watch it all the way
down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour
round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric
juice coils of intestines like pipes.	1782.9528934409334
But the poor buffer would have to
stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	1254.2739107631082
—_A cenar teco._
	1196.3033680726708
What does that _teco_ mean?	1376.852245346371
Tonight perhaps.	592.3640888758189
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
	1196.2882232833313
To come to supper tonight,
	1376.8304796258515
The rum the rumdum.	1196.3022706333559
Doesn’t go properly.	1196.2769856934065
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	706.1565772035038
That’ll be two pounds ten about
two pounds eight.	1823.8359766468466
Three Hynes owes me.	841.8114424048898
Two eleven.	592.3640888758189
Prescott’s dyeworks
van over there.	1250.4223773554077
If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen.	946.430728109476
Five guineas
about.	946.4336915828404
On the pig’s back.	1185.2422563472894
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
garters.	953.4107990011801
Not think.	592.3640888758189
Tour the south then.	991.9458203089375
What about English wateringplaces?	592.3640888758189
Piers by moonlight.	946.4292464214541
Her voice floating out.	1196.3022706333559
Those lovely
seaside girls.	528.0465860455535
Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	1660.6262796758483
Handy man wants job.	1196.3022706333559
Small wages.	592.3640888758189
Will eat anything.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.	1152.306348950596
_Why I left the
church of Rome?	575.648177435288
Birds’ Nest._ Women run him.	748.7527617590957
They say they used to give
pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato
blight.	1347.1525728918216
Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor
jews.	1541.239058634319
Same bait.	592.3640888758189
Why we left the church of Rome.	597.9026123204592
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.	1870.7881677818232
No
tram in sight.	991.9833491915258
Wants to cross.	647.1925222711825
—Do you want to cross?	613.296609253478
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
The blind stripling did not answer.	1512.0197894873443
His wallface frowned weakly.	1196.3022706333559
He
moved his head uncertainly.	1376.8930843000091
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Molesworth street is opposite.	1196.3022706333559
Do you want to cross?	613.296609253478
There’s nothing in the way.	699.1221539333914
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	1150.673432619642
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s.	1450.4759166460783
Where I
saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	1039.4054228922153
Horse drooping.	592.3640888758189
Driver in
John Long’s.	592.3640888758189
Slaking his drouth.	737.2943990675084
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.	930.1812020637503
I’ll see you
across.	1096.0882838388202
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?	580.2749502815082
—Yes, the stripling answered.	1196.3022706333559
South Frederick street.	592.3640888758189
—Come, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
guide it forward.	2026.6072152698146
Say something to him.	674.0390110038335
Better not do the condescending.	1376.826093171374
Pass a common remark.	1196.3022706333559
—The rain kept off.	1196.3022706333559
No answer.	592.3640888758189
Stains on his coat.	698.9633127592983
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	592.3640888758189
Tastes all different
for him.	812.0285873653214
Have to be spoonfed first.	1376.7470266108558
Like
Milly’s was.	698.03117947081
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	870.2102373750972
Wonder if
he has a name.	689.4668253538548
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired
drudge get his doze.	1975.9372110351926
That’s right.	593.5165079714973
Behind a bull: in front of a
horse.	822.8617095126845
—Thanks, sir.	592.3640888758189
Knows I’m a man.	686.793990088374
—Right now?	592.3640888758189
First turn to the left.	737.337351425989
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
his cane back, feeling again.	1633.571738362098
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
tweed.	1746.6163019499757
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	1192.530151130804
Must have felt it.	1196.2968199209593
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
of volume.	1632.6274776234934
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	1388.40294626464
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	1767.7133567921965
Feel a gap.	946.4292464214541
Queer
idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	1003.6258590352406
Could
he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane?	1370.0745746751074
Bloodless pious face like
a fellow going in to be a priest.	1149.236895034458
Penrose! That was that chap’s name.	946.5194223849411
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	1185.984108577244
Read with their fingers.	1196.176916279091
Tune pianos.	592.3640888758189
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	1699.9774131021375
Why we think a
deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might
say.	1959.3247127467541
Of course the other senses are more.	1452.7364593997775
Plait baskets.	592.3640888758189
People ought to help.	1196.3471619032707
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.	841.8055116861434
Hates sewing.	592.3640888758189
Might take an objection.	1196.2980565823646
Dark men they call them.	895.8261225171979
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	1616.7232203619883
Smells on all sides, bunched
together.	1130.4509478686468
Each street different smell.	1196.3022706333559
Each person too.	946.4336915828404
Then the
spring, the summer: smells.	1512.107781131387
They say you can’t taste wines with
your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	1278.3734258344705
Also smoke in the dark they say
get no pleasure.	1365.2790277352995
And with a woman, for instance.	914.8592326689192
More shameless not seeing.	991.9789449784407
That girl
passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	650.2847361316112
Look at me.	556.5732152949726
I have
them all on.	1185.2448167588145
Must be strange not to see her.	1070.6745039308314
Kind of a form in his
mind’s eye.	1133.8672649622397
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	1661.6765361609207
His hands on her hair,
for instance.	1111.7720743723655
Say it was black, for instance.	1107.064325920596
We call it black.	1196.2400120717612
Then passing over her white skin.	1512.0909478232381
Different feel perhaps.	946.4336915828404
Feeling of
white.	946.3847909855381
Must answer.	592.3640888758189
Fag today.	592.3640888758189
Send her a postal order two
shillings, half a crown.	1287.5237477588541
Accept my little present.	1196.2769859504183
Stationer’s just
here too.	1376.841743725866
Think over it.	461.55151352172
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
his ears.	2026.6192012523823
Fibres of fine fine straw.	1376.8572643548641
Then gently his finger felt
the skin of his right cheek.	1747.5637547493043
Downy hair there too.	991.9649676584733
Not smooth enough.	946.4336915828404
The belly is the smoothest.	1376.5679190271503
No-one about.	737.289920052089
There he goes into Frederick
street.	748.7471018818445
Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.	1082.0154678135393
Might be settling
my braces.	1376.8650244983396
Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
his belly.	1855.7216991828043
But I know it’s whitey yellow.	1322.7961235234243
Want to try in the dark to
see.	869.9555109734725
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	1392.2525250518192
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	570.6204444827621
Really terrible.	592.3640888758189
What dreams would
he have, not seeing?	1189.3660202827127
Life a dream for him.	812.0194337698312
Where is the justice being
born that way?	1286.6103796753393
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
and drowned in New York.	1263.3261976497963
Karma they call that transmigration
for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	1386.5724545894582
Dear, dear, dear.	946.4292464214541
Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to
them someway.	1577.162603751137
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall.	1089.229409042077
Solemn as Troy.	592.3640888758189
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	885.1445148592011
Old legal cronies cracking a
magnum.	1512.1352658891174
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat
school.	1686.1196884105548
I sentenced him to ten years.	1250.378134395285
I suppose he’d turn up his nose
at that stuff I drank.	1406.8848046786222
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
dusty bottle.	1686.639121080665
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.	1748.1083785536327
Wellmeaning old man.	593.5060833076691
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their

Sends them to the rightabout.	861.3328923007133
The devil

Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	946.3726023465958
Now he’s really
what they call a dirty jew.	1555.3994460026381
Power those judges have.	1196.3022706333559
Crusty old topers
in wigs.	1376.8650244983396
Bear with a sore paw.	1375.9391316006308
And may the Lord have mercy on your
soul.	679.7894202296378
Hello, placard.	592.3640888758189
Mirus bazaar.	592.3640888758189
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	583.6723478741284
Today it is.	345.8160364225982
In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital.	792.4233175272344
_The
Messiah_ was first given for that.	972.2471462619069
Drop in on Keyes.	592.3640888758189
No use sticking to him like a
leech.	1244.554482827086
Wear out my welcome.	1196.2980565823646
Sure to know someone on the gate.	1373.4969641882894
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	592.3640888758189
First I must.	592.3640888758189
Tan shoes.	592.3640888758189
Turnedup trousers.	592.3640888758189
It is.	592.3640888758189
It is.	592.3640888758189
His heart quopped softly.	1196.3022706333559
To the right.	474.3944866311533
He swerved
to the right.	508.6542822405159
Is it?	592.3640888758189
Almost certain.	592.3640888758189
Won’t look.	946.4203558902273
Wine in my face.	991.8240448291414
Why did I?	592.3640888758189
Too
heady.	592.3640888758189
Yes, it is.	345.8160364225982
The walk.	592.3640888758189
Not see.	592.3640888758189
Get on.	592.3640888758189
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	1436.6700953083125
Handsome building.	592.3640888758189
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	592.3640888758189
Not following me?	737.2909362695849
Didn’t see me perhaps.	943.5708944640944
Light in his eyes.	408.21954812620754
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	1569.7624999163822
Cold
statues: quiet there.	1196.3022706333559
Safe in a minute.	565.7978695788372
Didn’t see me.	676.4498623854969
After two.	592.3640888758189
Just at the gate.	676.2905417542182
My heart!
	592.3640888758189
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	1692.2153760657486
Sir
Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	592.3640888758189
Look for something I.	592.3640888758189
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
Agendath Netaim.	1323.1834809154598
Where did I?	592.3640888758189
Busy looking.	592.3640888758189
He thrust back quick Agendath.	784.6746171349943
I am looking for that.	894.8380812020707
Yes, that.	592.3640888758189
Try all pockets.	946.4336915828404
Walk quietly.	592.3640888758189
Moment more.	592.3640888758189
My heart.	592.3640888758189
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap
lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	1610.6340541498516
Ah soap there I yes.	592.3640888758189
Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
	1276.0574013628761
—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	1344.9486306077458
A great poet on a great brother poet.	1699.7422464280396
A hesitating soul taking arms
against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
real life.	1947.6200733243898
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	2021.6335895279926
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
noiseless beck.	1775.8070231752397
—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	1700.1017478347885
The beautiful
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	1871.0631082488678
One always
feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true.	1196.2938423406192
True in the larger analysis.	1377.443423206563
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	1376.8650244983396
Bald, most zealous by the door
he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was
gone.	1785.1492620250008
Two left.	592.3640888758189
—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
before his death.	1133.8432821210606
—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
elder’s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?	1237.0134311575155
_The Sorrows
of Satan_ he calls it.	885.1552268103758
Smile Cranly’s smile.	841.8114424048898
First he tickled her
	1196.3022706333559
Then he patted her
	1196.2980565823646
Then he passed the female catheter
	1250.364408563215
For he was a medical
	771.1399740875842
Jolly old medi...	946.4336915828404
—I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
mystic mind.	1295.625491847373
calls them.	2415.9278085666288
Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed.	2083.542142601524
He
laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.	1196.3005850111786
Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
	1196.2904183486771
Tears such as angels weep.	1376.7931980776978
Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.	1616.8260600451579
He holds my follies hostage.	1376.8650244983396
Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland.	1106.4249882434176
Gaptoothed
Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.	1699.9778022070439
And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve.	1275.2196844769585
In the
shadow of the glen he cooees for them.	1089.7433276379693
My soul’s youth I gave him,
night by night.	952.356707840334
God speed.	592.3640888758189
Good hunting.	592.3640888758189
Mulligan has my telegram.	991.9824392102742
—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
shadow.	999.7515234070653
I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	592.3640888758197
Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus.	1195.833767882423
Art has to reveal
to us ideas, formless spiritual essences.	1823.8291830462645
The supreme question about a
work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.	1785.1587003376296
The painting of
Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas.	894.6943229349306
The deepest poetry of Shelley,
the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas.	1047.901693137055
All the rest is the speculation of
schoolboys for schoolboys.	1823.7106463378855
has been telling some yankee interviewer.	1212.3784359088245
Wall, tarnation strike
me!
	1196.2938424605543
—The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	1003.524259793509
Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.	748.7545201171381
—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	1122.249999788066
One
can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	1600.3749439534504
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	1767.5419693626839
Formless spiritual.	592.3640888758189
Father, Word and Holy Breath.	592.3640888758189
Allfather, the
heavenly man.	1196.2980565823646
Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
suffers in us at every moment.	1275.797621920908
This verily is that.	624.4505370395897
I am the fire upon
the altar.	1452.5796283841999
I am the sacrificial butter.	1376.82233991189
Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
secret to adepts.	908.828665072399
Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to
see if they can help.	1360.271253003785
The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
plane of buddhi.	1975.7269065909904
The life esoteric is not for ordinary person.	1548.009524111066
O.P.	592.3640888758189
must work off bad karma first.	2416.242113702721
Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
illustrious sister H.P.B.’s elemental.	978.6468698817438
O, fie! Out on’t! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you
naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.	1326.187665974888
Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	1322.66050282485
He bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	1519.885263744136
—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.	1390.6191438824094
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
	1196.3022706333559
—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato.	1376.852913528593
—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?	1288.463767307765
Unsheathe your dagger definitions.	1196.3022706333559
Horseness is the whatness of
allhorse.	1334.4120341679632
Streams of tendency and eons they worship.	1616.8260600451579
God: noise in the
street: very peripatetic.	954.0100716172417
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they
creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this
vegetable world is but a shadow.	1660.7463537953977
Hold to the now, the here, through
which all future plunges to the past.	1762.9888359337083
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	1426.0962007519313
—Haines is gone, he said.	472.5394835484461
—Is he?	592.3640888758189
—I was showing him Jubainville’s book.	885.1498603158275
He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t
you know, about Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn’t bring him in
to hear the discussion.	947.8262389258826
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.	896.9010118128887
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
	1512.138816961438
To greet the callous public.	1376.8650244983396
Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish
	1322.649853024991
—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	852.7214667191225
We feel in England.	592.3640888758189
I smoked his baccy.	1196.3022706333559
Green
twinkling stone.	946.4336915828404
An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	795.3683666171767
—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
Russell warned occultly.	1449.9071590836738
For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
living mother.	1836.97806382084
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce
the sixshilling novel, the musichall song.	1833.8867525499486
France produces the finest
flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed
only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.	1320.849261322151
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	869.1403745529832
—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	1041.0511671989914
The one about
_Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don’t
you know, _reading the book of himself_.	1235.7890706271057
He describes _Hamlet_ given in
a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.	852.8308924755203
They advertised it.	946.4336915828404
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	1557.411527190103
_Hamlet
ou
Le Distrait
Pièce de Shakespeare_
	592.3640888758189
He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:
	841.8114424048898
—_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don’t you know.	338.45186865864895
It’s so French.	592.3640888758189
The French
point of view.	894.7826627204786
—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	592.3640888758189
John Eglinton laughed.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	652.0251877670981
Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	1823.828512695166
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	1512.138816961438
—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	689.3637492420131
Not
for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palms.	1901.4775557914777
Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.	1482.4172114403152
Our Father who art in purgatory.	1196.2889553452435
Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.	862.2493789341189
The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.	1597.4708020438766
Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	1266.8781379186073
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
	1700.070883610277
But we had spared...	1196.2724923142
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	1082.0154678135393
The devil and the deep sea.	1333.878863385579
—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for
Mr Best’s behoof.	824.5443571516249
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
flesh creep.	1218.3174329550366
List! List! O List!
	592.3640888758189
My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	1512.138816961438
If thou didst ever...	1196.2980565823646
—What is a ghost?	822.3890707050053
Stephen said with tingling energy.	1376.8528320214311
One who has faded
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners.	1976.3974616995047
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin.	800.6035919024489
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,
returning to the world that has forgotten him?	1484.3823196814928
Who is King Hamlet?	592.3640888758189
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	1584.6698310782483
—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing.	1489.4288453894933
The flag is up on the playhouse by the
bankside.	1432.478932487241
The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.	890.5469536210313
Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
groundlings.	1275.1992929039122
Local colour.	592.3640888758189
Work in all you know.	859.5448891252136
Make them accomplices.	946.4336915828404
—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks
by the swanmews along the riverbank.	1450.7653437761103
But he does not stay to feed the
pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	1959.3290281840552
The swan of Avon
has other thoughts.	885.1516420694329
Composition of place.	737.2909362695849
Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
	1322.634571467033
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	1731.1043601878316
It is
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	1386.3855237752311
He speaks the words to
Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of
cerecloth, calling him by a name:
	1529.6742250596344
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,
	729.0210849649845
bidding him list.	2415.9675238541713
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	965.1452845547167
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	1298.0624716945335
—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.	1461.8560718204699
Art thou there, truepenny?	1196.3022706333559
—Interesting only to the parish clerk.	1333.8794972624562
I mean, we have the plays.	1103.5695914781859
I
mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the
poet lived?	1294.1195988748693
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l’Isle has said.	1045.9351749098914
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts.	1567.0146369620043
We have _King Lear_: and it is
immortal.	870.2844981350427
Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.	1322.6412325128836
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,
	1823.7297686762174
Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	592.3640888758189
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	1546.6860867349062
Marry, I wanted it.	841.8114424048898
Take thou this noble.	1196.3022706333559
Do you intend to pay it back?	1287.7986080078283
When, then?	592.3640888758189
I paid my way.	519.309860708638
I paid my way.	519.309860708638
Steady on.	592.3640888758189
He’s from beyant Boyne water.	748.7549780351424
The northeast corner.	946.4336915828404
You owe
it.	946.4336915828404
Five months.	592.3640888758189
Molecules all change.	946.4336915828404
I am other I now.	592.3640888758189
Other I got
pound.	841.8114424048898
I that sinned and prayed and fasted.	1616.8130420134214
A child Conmee saved from pandies.	946.4292463762724
I, I and I.	592.3640888758189
A.E.I.O.U.	592.3640888758189
—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?	1135.6568561503504
John Eglinton’s carping voice asked.	989.2608814001875
Her ghost at least has been laid
for ever.	1480.982772207105
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	1387.6635044639008
—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	971.9691315525137
She
saw him into and out of the world.	496.45818577799196
She took his first embraces.	1376.784547894907
She
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids
closed when he lay on his deathbed.	1785.4877760752263
Mother’s deathbed.	946.4336915828404
The sheeted mirror.	946.4336915828404
Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers.	1946.098383121535
_Liliata
rutilantium._
	946.4336915828404
I wept alone.	946.4336915828404
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	1584.7156790439585
—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.	1199.3378296577132
—Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	841.8114424048898
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	1616.769167414918
His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	1692.1694656209436
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	1719.1243986692282
—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine.	1557.0148750233236
What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?	706.1578209475638
—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world.	1224.8278552083539
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
know.	1232.4898956283305
Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.	1322.66644192061
Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	1344.9239456122573
His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
guiltless though maligned.	2086.766925460003
—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	1208.1865524956527
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of
hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	1537.8277040635394
That memory, _Venus
and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.	1014.5618777309871
Is
Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	1039.4127464487399
Hortensio calls her young and
beautiful.	1334.630912131311
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	1266.7246356580908
Good: he left her
and gained the world of men.	1194.6228855029058
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	1253.3898900351905
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	1767.7495098637132
He chose badly?	946.4336915828404
He
was chosen, it seems to me.	756.0594870636779
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	974.7610549256461
By cock, she was to blame.	1197.4100808409992
She put the comether on him, sweet and
twentysix.	1767.7025886294102
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	1641.6243343253907
And my turn?	946.4248011905848
—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.	1512.1175097502276
He murmured then with blond delight for all:
	1548.0425764442
Between the acres of the rye
	1249.7775301689983
These pretty countryfolk would lie.	1376.8572643548625
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	1196.3022706333559
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
cooperative watch.	1976.4087894394413
—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._
	784.6746171349952
Whither away?	592.3640888758189
Exploitable ground.	592.3640888758189
—Are you going?	737.2864571841536
John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked.	1196.3022706333559
Shall we see you
at Moore’s tonight?	1003.5119851827509
Piper is coming.	556.5732152949726
—Piper! Mr Best piped.	592.3640888758189
Is Piper back?	592.3640888758189
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	1700.062898763673
—I don’t know if I can.	603.8756698393101
We have our meeting.	1196.2854142614635
If I can get
away in time.	1082.9138917816615
Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.	592.3640888758189
_Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we
tried to pawn.	1039.4010281160179
Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an
Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.	1597.832356757151
The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,
ringroundabout him.	1871.0856197321893
Louis H.	592.3640888758189
Caulfield Irwin.	592.3640888758189
Lotus ladies
tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow.	1871.0559792701242
Filled with his god,
he thrones, Buddh under plantain.	1106.2364861295716
Gulfer of souls, engulfer.	1196.3094618986881
Hesouls,
shesouls, shoals of souls.	1096.1066459641481
Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,
whirling, they bewail.	1700.070883610277
In quintessential triviality
	946.4336915828404
For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	1700.0146662608797
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses.	1735.0156651542502
We are all looking
forward anxiously.	1512.1148834282446
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
lighted, shone.	1734.5294122541961
See this.	592.3640888758189
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
ashplanthandle over his knee.	1594.4400064771394
My casque and sword.	1196.3022706333559
Touch lightly with
two index fingers.	1512.0829182547388
Aristotle’s experiment.	946.4336915828404
One or two?	593.501325861467
Necessity is
that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	1720.5298829127803
Argal, one hat is one hat.	1512.1139591971871
Young Colum and Starkey.	592.3640888758189
George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	1322.6205628095183
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he?	945.7703310275054
I
liked Colum’s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	807.9305495100781
Do
you think he has genius really?	1373.714428920209
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild
earth a Grecian vase_.	869.1381479093833
Did he?	592.3640888758189
I hope you’ll be able to come tonight.	1339.7896745778546
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	1039.4187676546546
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	835.2893376458155
Did
you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn?	673.1147743861916
Awfully clever, isn’t it?	601.1448178745248
They remind one of Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza.	692.5044133719111
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr
Sigerson says.	1048.322541019377
Moore is the man for it.	709.1532106017394
A knight of the rueful
countenance here in Dublin.	1139.1648222692484
With a saffron kilt?	1196.3022706333559
O’Neill Russell?	592.3640888758189
O,
yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.	1767.736420860976
And his Dulcinea?	592.3640888758189
James
Stephens is doing some clever sketches.	1322.6578404480322
We are becoming important, it
seems.	1250.4345713229386
_Cordoglio._ Lir’s loneliest daughter.	946.4336915828393
Now your best French polish.	592.3640888758189
—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	656.2760502332642
If you will be
so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...	1095.8776191485888
—O, yes.	592.3640888758189
If he considers it important it will go in.	1496.635210066995
We have so much
correspondence.	1376.8452499259035
—I understand, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
God ild you.	946.4336915828404
The pigs’ paper.	946.4336915828404
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too.	1106.4202425543708
Are we going to be
read?	959.6319671956156
I feel we are.	991.9372606532917
The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.	885.1534237904042
I hope
you will come round tonight.	1452.6989227141619
Bring Starkey.	592.3640888758189
Stephen sat down.	946.4414778653814
Blushing, his mask
said:
	1196.2980565823646
—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	1322.6578404480322
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
	1828.762183241422
—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	1352.9180538662251
Alarmed face asks me.	1196.2980565823661
Why did he come?	991.9073466404335
Courtesy or an inward light?	1376.8378633198686
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.	910.658889436917
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
from hue and cry.	1788.34147874805
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	1700.5202012184004
Women
he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters’ wives.	1528.9913054955373
Fox and geese.	737.2943990675084
And in New Place a slack
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
grave and unforgiven.	1939.355280259533
So you think...	647.1631863919354
The door closed behind the outgoer.	1512.075035695201
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.	1946.1097388789065
A vestal’s lamp.	1196.2980565823661
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore
when he lived among women.	1644.9608849851827
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	1747.898238274371
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	1616.8245006686975
And I heard the voice
of that Egyptian highpriest.	586.2584662336122
_In painted chambers loaded with
tilebooks._
	1616.8260600451579
They are still.	946.4248011905848
Once quick in the brains of men.	1288.1762291630369
Still: but an itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will.	1904.3766492902714
—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic.	1289.2254682639075
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	1496.7903154323446
Not even so
much.	991.9567321767834
Others abide our question.	1196.3022706333559
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	863.251555872072
—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?	849.5709141276103
Mr Best pleaded.	592.3640888758189
I mean, a kind
of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life.	1129.5199701399995
I mean, I don’t
care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	1086.7362422717736
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
defiance.	1341.00350109029
His private papers in the original.	990.555519459764
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	1512.138816961438
Taim in mo shagart_.	1196.3022706333559
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	1376.8442765960092
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
	592.3640888758189
—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	1168.7028841914907
Bear with me.	528.9436462520625
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows.	1911.359576832511
A basilisk.	592.3640888758189
_E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_.	1616.8260600451579
Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	961.5890325283625
—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
artist weave and unweave his image.	1443.890033334628
And as the mole on my right breast
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
the image of the unliving son looks forth.	1791.956783536615
In the intense instant of
imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which
I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to
be.	1265.7871826310925
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit
here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	1132.7691876306542
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	1089.3432712727506
—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	784.6746171349943
I feel Hamlet quite young.	784.6746171349943
The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son.	1399.5323821070078
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	1616.34002503891
He is in my father.	1185.1215090625233
I am in his son.	1096.0266003465551
—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	1067.2522186010783
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	1322.6026128929743
—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
in the market.	1704.7882377700646
The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit.	1141.5346771674715
—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	1276.0872099040764
—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.	1245.4285060326877
Said that.	592.3640888758189
—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	1317.4137979325371
What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre?	897.9800897483777
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	1196.3022706333559
—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	902.0160010180692
—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected.	1425.9797539451577
The highroads are dreary but they
lead to the town.	1691.6008601455078
Good Bacon: gone musty.	841.8114424048898
Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats.	770.2827166624523
Seekers on the great quest.	1376.3924494789958
What town, good
masters?	1196.2938424605543
Mummed in names: A.	592.3640888758189
E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.	592.3640888758189
East of the
sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_.	967.7700927984969
Booted the twain and staved.	1376.8650244983396
How many miles to Dublin?	784.6746171349943
Three score and ten, sir.	1185.2723189128167
Will we be there by candlelight?	1512.127121577485
—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period.	1188.0252830744555
—Does he?	592.3640888758189
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it?	833.2636474931622
—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost.	946.7600222342469
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s
child.	1795.704419970863
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	1364.775319016092
—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	1039.3662565223697
_L’art d’être
grand_...	1376.8650244983396
Do you know what you are talking about?	705.6549496207612
Love, yes.	592.3640888758189
Word known to all
men.	694.6625747459167
_Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
..._
	1911.359576832511
—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
all experience, material and moral.	1571.8061595141642
Such an appeal will touch him.	1512.1255373365234
The
images of other males of his blood will repel him.	1870.7337379814226
He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.	1905.42344284582
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	1518.3083340542632
—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public.	1128.5312480166467
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
George Bernard Shaw.	703.7995376558993
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	724.1070297587211
His articles
on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	764.8733405781387
Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
the sonnets.	1874.243321790038
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	692.5044133719111
I
own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more
in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
been.	1665.0028857662473
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,
prize of their fray.	1874.867377218029
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	1700.069172476565
Dost love, Miriam?	592.3640888758189
Dost
love thy man?	1196.3022706333559
—That may be too, Stephen said.	748.7365504589527
There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr
Magee likes to quote.	912.8777629309272
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
will get it in middle life.	1845.4969506528205
Why does he send to one who is a
_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	1977.6725689163982
He was himself a lord
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had
written _Romeo and Juliet_.	1375.8944803836882
Belief in himself has been untimely
killed.	1616.7496354648292
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)
and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play
victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	1571.5684836702433
Assumed dongiovannism will
not save him.	1512.1122572864122
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	1699.9684058035584
The tusk of
the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	1945.6308963797578
If the shrew
is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.	1821.7421513869692
There is,
I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
understanding of himself.	1727.478100517553
They list.	592.3640888758189
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	936.8981128897377
—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear.	1713.2921781332057
But those who are done to death in sleep
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	1729.931081403752
The poisoning and the
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	1626.5752938359215
That is why the
speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,
backward.	1462.3522905047184
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,
with its mole cinquespotted.	1485.2686793063217
He goes back, weary of the creation he has
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	2069.1072612518665
But,
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
has revealed.	1988.294056314626
His beaver is up.	1196.2938424605543
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind
by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
consubstantial with the father.	1566.0735518568401
—Amen! was responded from the doorway.	917.9185118947252
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	885.1534237904042
_Entr’acte_.	592.3640888758189
A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	1591.3037189325225
My telegram.	592.3640888758189
—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	1274.8744224890218
he
asked of Stephen.	584.9362606481292
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a
bauble.	1344.4316431484056
They make him welcome.	991.942323849875
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._
	841.8114424048898
Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	592.3640888758189
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,
Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,
stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on
crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and
dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	1370.4955785966222
He lifts his hands.	773.2492116392219
Veils fall.	592.3640888758189
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells
aquiring.	1089.35874896254
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	910.4370384359491
A most instructive discussion.	1196.2980565823661
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
Shakespeare.	1425.8083415746023
All sides of life should be represented.	1616.790028483668
He smiled on all sides equally.	1130.437673765153
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
	841.8114424048898
I seem to know the name.	781.3851340108372
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	1767.7075126439047
The chap that writes like
Synge.	946.431468999537
Mr Best turned to him.	565.4831762084731
—Haines missed you, he said.	421.33173023344705
Did you meet him?	899.5892576106746
He’ll see you after at
the D.	1037.3717602399106
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	635.9052991220506
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	729.8864024447017
Was he here?	946.4336915828404
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.	1426.0679552436457
I hear that an actress
played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	1253.539966114014
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	1011.4871816647599
Has no-one made him out to be
an Irishman?	1038.3504723981669
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	1293.4480743139134
He
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.	592.3640888758197
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook.	1240.7316778163904
That _Portrait of Mr W.	592.3640888758189
H._ where he
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all
hues.	1512.056934522912
—For Willie Hughes, is it not?	946.4715858968244
the quaker librarian asked.	585.7626980559412
Or Hughie Wills?	592.3640888758189
H.: who am I?	592.3640888758189
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	946.4336915828404
Of
course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out.	1060.6031302483907
It’s the very
essence of Wilde, don’t you know.	568.5795711529479
The light touch.	946.4336915828404
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	1911.277700717429
Tame essence of Wilde.	592.3640888758189
You’re darned witty.	1196.3022706333559
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
Deasy’s ducats.	1122.2528748785053
How much did I spend?	592.3640888758189
O, a few shillings.	1196.2232832827813
For a plump of pressmen.	1376.8572642759873
Humour wet and dry.	1196.2896284392518
You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks
in.	1976.399427288958
Lineaments of gratified desire.	1196.3022706333559
There be many mo.	1196.2980565823646
Take her for me.	654.5344081405178
In pairing time.	737.2943990675084
Yea, turtledove her.	946.4336915828404
Naked wheatbellied sin.	946.4336915828404
A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.	1474.246909527117
—Do you think it is only a paradox?	1283.714552339848
the quaker librarian was asking.	1049.3863805973363
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	1647.459285038753
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.	1616.8260600451579
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	946.432209860059
Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	1426.2902440394887
His
mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	1700.0626804608025
—Telegram! he said.	262.36878812105795
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
	748.7545201171381
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
	1312.0709977879276
—_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus.	979.1966804760452
The kips?	592.3640888758189
College Green.	592.3640888758189
Have you drunk the four
quid?	1334.623825719387
The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father.	1496.4199693831138
Telegram!
Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	592.3640888758189
O, you peerless mummer!
O, you priestified Kinchite!
	706.1578209475638
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
querulous brogue:
	1824.2279060952542
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	1428.6911932846656
’Twas murmur we did
for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with
leching.	1699.93806746757
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s
sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	1668.887793929964
He wailed:
	592.3640888758189
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	2031.7556864956966
Stephen laughed.	592.3640888758189
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	748.7540041052788
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	754.4862908696189
He heard
you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	1293.4075679485422
He’s out in pampooties to
murder you.	1222.44022033146
—Me! Stephen exclaimed.	592.3640888758189
That was your contribution to literature.	1512.1317147529485
—Murder you! he laughed.	1196.3200328522037
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of
lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts.	1477.1139311173358
In words of words for words,
palabras.	1616.7984643599032
Oisin with Patrick.	592.3640888758189
Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
brandishing a winebottle.	1106.4215236644156
_C’est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish.	885.1534237904042
His
image, wandering, he met.	1376.8495037818602
I mine.	592.3640888758189
I met a fool i’the forest.	1452.684448904307
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	1095.6211305807615
in which everyone can find his own.	2170.717738760429
So Mr Justice Madden in his
_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	841.8069942564179
What is it?	338.4313499265509
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
offering a card.	1597.9954013281977
From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
_Kilkenny People_ for last year.	880.3179628303255
—Certainly, certainly, certainly.	946.4292464214541
Is the gentleman?...	737.2407918434391
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
asked, creaked, asked:
	2002.9988966408175
—Is he?...	592.3640888758189
O, there!
	592.3640888758189
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	1699.6755331001166
In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
honest broadbrim.	2113.243604711767
—This gentleman?	592.3640888758189
_Freeman’s Journal?	592.3640888758189
Kilkenny People?_ To be sure.	660.8530437226349
Good
day, sir.	737.2918380794588
We have certainly...	946.4336915828404
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	1376.8650244983396
—All the leading provincial...	1196.3022706333559
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,
Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903...	592.3640888758189
Will you please?...	593.5117508033923
Evans, conduct this
gentleman...	991.9754506878854
If you just follow the atten...	1512.1068563113524
Or, please allow me...	843.0432662507601
This way...	592.3640888758189
Please, sir...	592.3640888758189
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
dark figure following his hasty heels.	1604.0363528687799
The door closed.	737.2909362695849
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	592.3640888758189
He jumped up and snatched the card.	1234.3075074606338
—What’s his name?	514.0729355654896
Ikey Moses?	592.3640888758189
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	970.8228079676003
I found him over in the
museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	1086.4788781114296
The Greek mouth
that has never been twisted in prayer.	1470.28084807687
Every day we must do homage to
her.	1286.6964175366018
_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._
	1616.837868377541
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
	528.2291751872539
—He knows you.	946.4292464214541
He knows your old fellow.	878.3632104347241
O, I fear me, he is Greeker
than the Greeks.	784.6701579689308
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	1293.4440254219694
Venus Kallipyge.	592.3640888758189
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the
maiden hid_.	1344.9155760319502
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.	773.4815632161916
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	913.7640039025563
Till now we had thought of her, if
at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	1295.7220413527814
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	976.0848401623459
Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a
salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	1367.4926245647882
His life was
rich.	1196.2896282679212
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called
it, is the art of surfeit.	1051.2561101010847
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,
honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,
ringocandies.	1976.4113624741221
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a
million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	1487.5068141507272
The
gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of
Sheba.	1133.2693650566503
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its
chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	1925.6309116738835
You know
Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her
bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s
blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	1274.2446223416366
And the gay
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	1446.3525271425967
Cours la Reine.	592.3640888758189
_Encore vingt sous.	946.4336915828404
Nous ferons de petites

Tu veux?_
	946.4336915828404
—The height of fine society.	1376.8677657362355
And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s
mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	1306.0827535386325
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
	1322.6551780224502
—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
	592.3640888758189
—And Harry of six wives’ daughter.	1196.2938423748878
And other lady friends from
neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	1262.7603139802263
But all those
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
behind the diamond panes?	1204.2637036785861
Do and do.	946.4037317473844
Thing done.	592.3640888758189
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn.	835.3394916541453
An azured harebell like her veins.	1512.113958114298
Lids of
Juno’s eyes, violets.	946.4313955700188
He walks.	592.3640888758189
One life is all.	822.528603264241
One body.	592.3640888758189
But do.	592.3640888758189
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	1945.7352206992932
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.	841.8118285266851
—Whom do you suspect?	1196.68918173084
he challenged.	2426.0978870330446
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	1063.83172476706
Once spurned twice
spurned.	1196.3022706333559
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	1578.2367837284505
Love that dare not speak its name.	846.7332935753124
—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord.	978.6307885621588
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	1512.138816961438
At Charenton I watched them.	784.6746171349943
—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
the stallion.	1576.2500574308344
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he
had a shrew to wife.	1091.490743724544
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a
bedvow.	1823.7814854591752
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the
dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s
brother.	1940.2745048497495
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	1156.6669908899098
Once a wooer,
twice a wooer.	1512.1246126500039
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	1177.9245758717811
—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	1588.8560863959442
If you
deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	1597.109080323628
All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use
granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	1118.9670826237293
O, yes, mention there is.	1185.3188949133255
In the years when he was living richly in
royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
father’s shepherd.	1528.3155598939495
Explain you then.	946.4203558902273
Explain the swansong too wherein
he has commended her to posterity.	1870.9649992981815
He faced their silence.	1196.3022706333559
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	841.8050764613612
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.	1018.0146763782654
She was entitled to her widow’s dower
At common law.	1191.2399399192761
His legal knowledge was great
Our judges tell us.	974.7587785103344
Him Satan fleers,
Mocker:
	592.3640888758189
And therefore when he was urged,
As I believe, to name her
He left her his
Secondbest
Bed.	847.9280798465637
_Punkt._
	592.3640888758189
Leftherhis
Secondbest

Leftabed.	592.3640888758189
—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	1616.7890891218287
—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and
landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	1258.536365932859
Why did he not leave her
his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
peace?	1705.4302220939962
—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
Secondbest Best said finely.	1341.392265960006
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
smiled on.	1262.7260917222015
—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	841.8114424048898
Let me think.	946.4348492096655
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget
Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	1724.1557904180004
—Do you mean he died so?	1334.6215464000752
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	1196.2938423748878
I mean...	592.3640888758189
—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	724.1084873131331
A quart of ale is a dish for
a king.	1627.0489949923754
O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
	676.8319741208147
asked Besteglinton.	592.3640888758189
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	894.7795219596067
The people’s William.	592.3640888758189
For
terms apply: E.	592.3640888758189
—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	784.6746171349943
I asked him what he thought
of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	1904.986296585852
He lifted his
hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those
days._ Lovely!
	1161.6484901470903
—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
ugling Eglinton.	1133.3294941748718
Steadfast John replied severe:
	841.8114424048898
—The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	1767.735580047222
You cannot eat your cake
and have it.	1393.1438825108455
Sayest thou so?	946.4336915828404
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	1370.9766690862455
—And the sense of property, Stephen said.	705.0201188362912
He drew Shylock out of his
own long pocket.	723.955911745821
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
famine riots.	1867.3342561332365
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	1549.8869128783863
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	2094.7967324460265
How else could
Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	1191.277515009594
All events brought grist to
his mill.	1616.5442962854963
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being
plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_
with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn
for witchroasting.	1438.4088594260595
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love’s Labour Lost_.	987.6007787260447
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
enthusiasm.	1344.849938305798
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s
theory of equivocation.	1625.2031179247253
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and
the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American
cousin.	784.5404303345692
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s.	748.7545201171381
As for fay Elizabeth,
otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives
of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for
deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	1134.895282296747
I think you’re getting on very nicely.	1393.16370259179
Just mix up a mixture of
theolologicophilolological.	1373.7210323353945
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._
	1376.8650244983396
—Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	463.5292508244006
Your dean
of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	956.0418489785214
_Sufflaminandus sum._
	946.4336915828404
—He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
polisher of Italian scandals.	784.616216074746
—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	592.3640888758189
Coleridge called him
myriadminded.	1196.2780828150392
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit
amicitia inter multos._
	1946.1189275392655
—Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	592.3640888758189
—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	927.3005126930505
There he keened a wailing rune.	1512.138816961438
—_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It’s destroyed we are from this day!
It’s destroyed we are surely!
	984.6260118092622
All smiled their smiles.	991.9824392102742
—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in
his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	1383.6882029414571
He means that
the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	1847.9628542005437
Jews, whom christians tax with
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	2002.967369957056
Accusations
are made in anger.	1185.269848711256
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
affections too with hoops of steel.	1981.5682295687184
Whether these be sins or virtues
old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	1462.3571034111856
But a man who holds so
tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will
hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
his wife.	1422.8507412287597
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	1957.1788421591575
—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	592.3640888758189
—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.	890.378098532349
—Which will?	592.3640888758189
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	841.8114424048898
We are getting mixed.	1196.2980565823646
—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s
widow, is the will to die.	950.5149435956889
_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.	592.3640888758189
What of all the will to do?	705.2576995277714
It has vanished long ago...	926.8888906834508
—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of
seven parishes.	2198.8704653484738
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed
with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid
for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a
soul.	1787.8426861594173
She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the
_Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she
thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most
Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_.	1030.574722442035
Venus has
twisted her lips in prayer.	1452.7041565996913
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	1512.1413257594845
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	1871.0360395848497
—History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.	974.7181390985155
The
ages succeed one another.	1040.6233858069554
But we have it on high authority that a man’s
worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	1509.0687997229463
I feel that
Russell is right.	619.1696092961139
What do we care for his wife or father?	1513.0030832864993
I should say
that only family poets have family lives.	1823.8278445200283
Falstaff was not a family
man.	1087.224332347608
I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.	1823.6095222367244
Lean, he lay back.	822.5502744360033
Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid.	1616.8260600451579
Shy, supping
with the godless, he sneaks the cup.	1556.8625700874097
A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it
him.	841.809959736356
Visits him here on quarter days.	1512.1317148251362
Says he’s your father, sir.	1512.2163219281254
Give me my
Wordsworth.	592.3640888758189
Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in
strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with
clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.	1663.5031323538535
Your own?	592.3640888758189
He knows your old fellow.	878.3632104347241
The widower.	592.3640888758189
The voice, new warmth, speaking.	1376.8650244983396
Dr Bob Kenny is
attending her.	946.4336915828393
The eyes that wish me well.	1334.6238261654355
But do not know me.	872.5852784936292
—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
evil.	1220.3029126802574
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.	1478.9401694878475
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,
with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,
with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the
lustful queen.	2047.4151707629205
The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
night.	844.9014664991857
From hour to hour it rots and rots.	1700.0589062326908
He rests, disarmed of
fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.	1782.6650231264462
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child.	1321.5962921089476
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to
man.	1512.5611034204233
It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only
begetter to only begotten.	1976.3046648649527
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.	1196.3022706333559
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true
thing in life.	1199.5874175723807
Who is the father of
any son that any son should love him or he any son?	1822.5632235461385
What the hell are you driving at?	1616.8272782490085
I know.	592.3640888758189
Shut up.	592.3640888758189
Blast you.	592.3640888758189
I have reasons.	946.4336915828404
Postea._
	592.3640888758189
Are you condemned to do this?	1512.1361544279694
—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
hardly record its breach.	1839.6946157465163
Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.	1856.1351632959743
The son
unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
care.	1946.114708830174
He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth
his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.	1532.8811331404556
In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.	706.1616211993988
—What links them in nature?	1376.8524778239166
Am I a father?	698.0188845761362
If I were?	592.3640888758189
Shrunken uncertain hand.	946.4336915828404
—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son.	920.6838165608234
The bulldog of
Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him.	1406.9526808069736
Well: if the
father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
father be a son?	1635.808536961849
When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another
poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not
the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and
felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own
grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,
never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors
perfection.	1353.1332269390757
Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.	1616.8041259147783
Gladly
glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.	1767.5410528430305
But flatter.	592.3640888758189
—Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself.	675.7077054446431
I am big with
child.	1185.2756593705158
I have an unborn child in my brain.	1699.9441319310451
Pallas Athena! A play! The
play’s the thing! Let me parturiate!
	841.7675489837807
He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.	1700.0715746598514
—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest
of Arden.	1128.4009083459569
Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
_Coriolanus._ His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare.	1007.4061506590496
Who the
girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter’s Tale_ are we know.	735.7332720555173
Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
guess.	819.3560536963473
But there is another member of his family who is recorded.	1471.799144398992
—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.	592.3640888758189
The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
haste, quake, quack.	1976.4004629066685
Door closed.	592.3640888758189
They list.	592.3640888758189
I you he they.	1196.3453191303872
Come, mess.	592.3640888758189
STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard.	706.1578209475638
Gilbert in
his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister
Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the
playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back.	1467.8394896293196
The
playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul.	795.3154627949452
He is nowhere: but an Edmund
and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.	899.9322590425294
MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?	577.5190898931259
BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know.	460.75364451191444
I hope you are going to
say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.	848.7185142166196
_(Laughter)_
	592.3640888758189
BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)
	592.3640888758189
Then outspoke medical Dick
	592.3640888758189
To his comrade medical Davy...	675.4922465572132
STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’
names.	965.9113825022426
Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.	1354.2728662592158
BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it.	817.1307659081443
I don’t want Richard, my name
...	509.7720399901308
_(Laughter)_
	592.3640888758189
QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...	1344.9574366638142
STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.	1468.6215339023506
He has revealed it
in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus.	962.927651126675
Like John o’Gaunt his
name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a
bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,
dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country.	1707.2175611682103
What’s in
a name?	571.6857845790905
That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the
name that we are told is ours.	2083.6542684481246
A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at
his birth.	1823.7886993806346
It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in
the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the
recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the
stars.	1428.3393555193381
His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the
bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight
returning from Shottery and from her arms.	1501.4929422342616
Both satisfied.	592.3640888758189
I too.	592.3640888758189
Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.	1685.3238962494763
And from her arms.	745.885345604781
Wait to be wooed and won.	1512.0237220672166
Ay, meacock.	592.3640888758189
Who will woo you?	1196.3022706333559
Read the skies.	946.4248011905848
Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where’s your
configuration?	885.1253764763626
Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even.	1196.2910330257043
D: _sua donna.	946.4336915828404
Già: di lui.	946.4336915828404
Gelindo risolve di non amare S.	946.4336915828393
D._
	592.3640888758189
—What is that, Mr Dedalus?	592.3640888758189
the quaker librarian asked.	585.7626980559412
Was it a
celestial phenomenon?	1376.8161812893047
—A star by night, Stephen said.	748.7545201171381
A pillar of the cloud by day.	664.5729001039389
What more’s to speak?	971.1466687920641
Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.	1246.2918512722445
_Stephanos,_ my crown.	1196.25169734676
My sword.	592.3640888758189
His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet.	1118.6931508520713
Buy a pair.	946.5108842208336
Holes in my socks.	1196.140746674028
Handkerchief too.	592.3640888758189
—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.	785.3303517616158
Your own name is
strange enough.	1512.0809508395907
Me, Magee and Mulligan.	592.3640888758189
Fabulous artificer.	592.3640888758189
The hawklike man.	946.4336915828404
You flew.	592.3640888758189
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger.	841.8114424048898
Paris and back.	556.5810572948353
_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering.	748.7545201171381
Lapwing you are.	461.5364173455861
Lapwing
be.	592.3640888758189
Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
	1128.6362518777662
—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know,
we find also in the old Irish myths.	1181.6237526380896
Just what you say.	676.421256230181
The three
brothers Shakespeare.	592.3640888758189
In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales.	700.9452069250847
The
third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
prize.	1976.3396929476105
Best of Best brothers.	592.3640888758189
Good, better, best.	946.4336915828404
The quaker librarian springhalted near.	1376.8398837024358
—I should like to know, he said, which brother you...	1365.2451193745212
I understand you
to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers...	1476.2253461401285
But perhaps
I am anticipating?	784.6746171349943
He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.	1366.991398738227
An attendant from the doorway called:
	1196.9834068509988
—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...	592.3640888758189
—O, Father Dineen! Directly.	592.3640888758189
Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.	1767.8772041989596
John Eglinton touched the foil.	1039.409817210504
—Come, he said.	262.36878812105795
Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.	971.7376627096905
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?	1017.3086225054034
—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.	1075.8732941610983
A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.	1767.7218339801677
Where is your brother?	1196.276985265057
My whetstone.	592.3640888758189
Him, then
Cranly, Mulligan: now these.	748.7545201171381
Speech, speech.	592.3640888758189
But act.	592.3640888758189
They
mock to try you.	1376.8328431619627
Be acted on.	737.2943990675084
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.	1039.3178234012928
My kingdom for a drink.	786.3683658355594
—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
took the stuff of his plays.	1719.226169365217
Why did he take them rather than others?	1548.0214139199359
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	1471.2569523936488
The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	1795.5549566523543
Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,
the angel of the world.	866.1390984388452
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to
a Celtic legend older than history?	946.6022722433439
—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.	592.3640888758189
We should not now combine
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.	1246.7089500319637
_Que
voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.	885.1534237904042
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	869.027360088383
Stephen answered himself.	946.4336915828404
Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	1744.326430743328
The note of
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
book.	1362.1232148244806
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	1439.1642650839415
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	1485.2411245974558
But it
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	1851.286257943997
The words are those of my
lords bishops of Maynooth.	1277.4046213013917
An original sin and, like original sin,
committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	2047.6875234858003
It is between the
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
which her four bones are not to be laid.	1720.8469242326255
Age has not withered it.	1376.851524847071
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	1700.0267478732023
It is in infinite variety
everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,
twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure
for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.	896.7299968289226
He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.	1747.776923774899
Judge Eglinton summed up.	841.8114424048898
—The truth is midway, he affirmed.	1334.6457671910655
He is the ghost and the prince.	1188.6326733601
He
is all in all.	797.1026873979087
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	1911.123799774528
All in all.	647.1906059764151
He
acts and is acted on.	1334.6309112933793
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he
kills the real Carmen.	1133.8465011208598
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	1556.852519760811
—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	748.7545201171381
O word of fear!
	1196.2559130336892
Dark dome received, reverbed.	1196.3022706333559
—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	784.6577520951704
When
all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.	872.5875810785723
After God
Shakespeare has created most.	946.431468999537
—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	1106.4180587440978
He returns after
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	1922.1894703408275
Then dies.	592.3640888758189
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A
king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	1196.1848358755842
And, what
though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
they refuse to be divorced.	1615.1829626330564
If you like the epilogue look long on it:
prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of
love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
place where the bad niggers go.	1451.2470048036462
Strong curtain.	592.3640888758189
He found in the world
without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	1251.6865637597532
Maeterlinck
says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
on his doorstep.	1399.9147305140445
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day.	1089.5596502601268
We walk through
ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.	2113.245868962745
The playwright
who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless
all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,
there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being
a wife unto himself.	1662.9625998920535
_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried.	592.3640888758189
_Eureka!_
	592.3640888758189
Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s
desk.	1095.2623899982987
—May I?	592.3640888758189
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	748.7545201171381
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	1232.6309281504487
Take some slips from the counter going out.	1342.0495789298632
The rest shall keep as they are.	1013.1250806745803
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	1039.4156756356856
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._
	1241.3850489110057
—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	903.095640078744
You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	1328.1210611607087
Do you believe
your own theory?	1512.0935751494376
—No, Stephen said promptly.	698.0360971394099
—Are you going to write it?	740.2663064399628
Mr Best asked.	592.3640888758189
You ought to make it a
dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	812.8869751685503
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	841.8114424048898
—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment
for it since you don’t believe it yourself.	1292.4101997145353
Dowden believes there is
some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	1199.6791276134843
Herr Bleibtreu, the man
Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	1039.3712022834825
He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
wrote the plays.	1401.1010231447804
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	1376.7542573556007
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	885.1534237904042
That is, help me to believe or
help me to unbelieve?	1525.2019353035566
Who helps to believe?	991.9693719730235
_Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?	675.4917508349126
Other chap.	592.3640888758189
—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	1328.12046324819
Then I don’t know about the next number.	1122.9951737522433
Fred Ryan wants space for an
article on economics.	1512.1178983284765
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	1452.7041579849692
Tide you over.	946.4336915828404
—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	1196.2946842114604
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:
	1734.9420088399918
—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa
contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly
and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	989.4842003838047
He broke away.	946.4336915828404
—Come, Kinch.	592.3640888758189
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	736.9037907370414
Come, Kinch.	592.3640888758189
You have eaten all we left.	1039.7134514024644
I will serve you your orts
and offals.	1700.0648949413728
Stephen rose.	592.3640888758189
Life is many days.	991.9789448889109
This will end.	946.4336915828404
—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	841.8026284380758
_Notre ami_ Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there.	713.2023780668918
—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
Ireland.	855.603717593655
I’ll be there.	745.9226588137606
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	931.9457879004532
Can you walk
straight?	991.9824392102742
Laughing, he...	592.3640888758189
Swill till eleven.	946.4336915828404
Irish nights entertainment.	946.4336915828404
Stephen followed a lubber...	991.9789448889109
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	994.0129937142009
His
lub back: I followed.	592.3640888758189
I gall his kibe.	1196.3022706333559
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a
wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering
daylight of no thought.	1818.0393687797623
What have I learned?	592.3640888758189
Of them?	592.3640888758189
Of me?	592.3640888758189
Walk like Haines now.	592.3640888758189
The constant readers’ room.	1196.3022706333559
In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor
Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables.	800.5917228780926
Item: was Hamlet
mad?	592.3640888758189
The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	1823.2549481348617
—O please do, sir...	899.5955950808823
I shall be most pleased...	1185.2479565906635
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:
	1376.859204268318
—A pleased bottom.	946.4336915828404
Is that?...	592.3640888758189
Idly writing...	592.3640888758189
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	784.6746171349943
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
	1512.13881696144
John Eglinton, my jo, John,
	592.3640888758189
Why won’t you wed a wife?	1054.4276870869166
He spluttered to the air:
	618.2184583610837
—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	592.3640888758189
We went over to their
playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall.	931.7965234267888
Our players are creating a
new art for Europe like the Greeks or M.	927.6366901603246
He spat blank.	946.4336915828404
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	1223.0452411953277
And
left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born?	1462.3434539902357
Go back.	592.3640888758189
The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.	1667.8951021392115
I just eh...	946.4336915828404
—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there...	615.2570036185964
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
	1039.41860477134
I hardly hear the purlieu cry
	1512.0926480404203
Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
	809.5804804742638
Before my thoughts begin to run
	1512.1122570638156
M’Curdy Atkinson,
	592.3640888758189
The same that had the wooden leg
	1287.6764257464715
And that filibustering filibeg
	1196.3022706333559
That never dared to slake his drouth,
	1452.7246273569733
Magee that had the chinless mouth.	1159.4713812820946
Being afraid to marry on earth
	1334.6175584455034
They masturbated for all they were worth.	1616.6221766723013
Jest on.	592.3640888758189
Know thyself.	592.3640888758189
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	1393.1214199649696
I halt.	592.3640888758189
—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	592.3640888758189
Synge has left off wearing
black to be like nature.	1692.1297989147276
Only crows, priests and English coal are
black.	1003.524259793509
A laugh tripped over his lips.	910.4142984675276
—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that

O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a
job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	1434.3784229680437
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?	795.3628449607448
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
	1871.029088119641
—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	1424.2408246379657
One thinks of Homer.	592.3640888758189
He stopped at the stairfoot.	1020.1445161793268
—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.	1575.8295524866417
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	946.4336915828393
Gone the nine men’s
morrice with caps of indices.	1823.8220332304181
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:
	946.4292463310895
_Everyman His Own Wife
or
A Honeymoon in the Hand
(a national immorality in three orgasms)
by
Ballocky Mulligan._
	841.8090701003202
He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:
	1196.2921567303206
But listen.	592.3640888758189
He read, _marcato:_

ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	822.5589667907208
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
	1459.6707946489726
—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
	1327.1263629613045
—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
them.	1253.7303143121485
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	1533.9215023955626
The moment is now.	991.9509890096092
Where then?	592.3640888758189
If Socrates leave his house today,
if Judas go forth tonight.	914.8644132343707
That lies in space which I in time must
come to, ineluctably.	1344.9535403369935
My will: his will that fronts me.	1616.8138895727036
Seas between.	592.3640888758189
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	1548.0852923575776
—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
The portico.	592.3640888758189
Here I watched the birds for augury.	1322.6372334581463
Ængus of the birds.	821.9053829037648
They go, they
come.	1196.2979173589902
Last night I flew.	592.3640888758189
Easily flew.	592.3640888758189
Men wondered.	592.3640888758189
Street of harlots

A creamfruit melon he held to me.	1086.772768100428
You will see.	946.4114650810416
—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe.	1039.4156756059133
Did you
see his eye?	836.0671878371719
I fear thee, ancient
mariner.	1376.8572642759873
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	1055.867505795579
Get thee a breechpad.	1196.3022706333559
Manner of Oxenford.	592.3640888758189
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	1512.1352658891174
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
under portcullis barbs.	1740.0024259370928
They followed.	592.3640888758189
Offend me still.	946.4292464214541
Speak on.	592.3640888758189
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	1196.3005850111786
No birds.	592.3640888758189
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in
a flaw of softness softly were blown.	1777.7952815469184
Cease to strive.	946.4336915828404
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:

Laud we the gods

And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
	1496.6234875540958
From our bless’d altars.	1376.8650244983396
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	666.215762451304
reset his smooth
watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	2093.290199505244
Five
to three.	737.2943990675084
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	972.1701281580488
What was that boy’s name
again?	1616.7302230026025
_Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the
person to see.	986.1910741282624
Mr Cunningham’s letter.	633.0210592346853
Oblige him, if possible.	1196.2937033233336
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	1616.8260600451579
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
crutches, growled some notes.	2002.8005373975577
He jerked short before the convent of the
sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
reverend John Conmee S.	1625.0579654729559
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	1324.607069514374
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	592.3640888758189
He thought, but not for long,
of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P.	1370.619272716781
—Very well, indeed, father.	1196.2980565823646
And you, father?	946.4336915828404
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	1196.2994612643795
He would go to Buxton
probably for the waters.	896.7496778608536
And her boys, were they getting on well at
Belvedere?	1376.8319773297585
Was that so?	489.3841106234864
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
that.	1072.5600813463216
And Mr Sheehy himself?	592.3640888758189
Still in London.	592.3640888758189
The house was still
sitting, to be sure it was.	1002.0542618117644
Beautiful weather it was, delightful
indeed.	1512.3165239651405
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would
come again to preach.	1134.004648260279
O, yes: a very great success.	1334.575305555332
A wonderful man
really.	1196.3022706333559
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.	685.1917958592575
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.	1141.4530619408392
Yes, he would certainly call.	1185.243661332923
—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	592.3640888758189
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	1401.4544969163192
And smiled yet again,
in going.	1512.103305097519
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	1823.847410537821
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.	1336.692047359952
—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?	1153.1010921097668
A zealous man, however.	1196.3022706333559
Really he was.	489.4560147059871
And really did great good in his
way.	1185.1991506837926
Beyond a doubt.	647.1873352442567
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	784.0140583897978
Of good family too would one think it?	1700.0484881320226
Welsh, were they not?	1196.2559121769154
O, lest he forget.	1196.2896284392518
That letter to father provincial.	1020.3545445892652
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square.	752.8506364381135
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	784.5675050432337
The little house.	946.4348492096655
And were
they good boys at school?	1452.689534394526
That was very good now.	1376.7943303550571
And what was his
name?	603.084807251118
Jack Sohan.	592.3640888758189
And his name?	489.3941047849076
And the other little
man?	1376.9077583114718
His name was Brunny Lynam.	592.3640888758189
O, that was a very nice name to have.	1008.4287195634646
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	886.7697817526744
—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	1078.067837423083
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
	724.1070297587211
—O, sir.	592.3640888758189
—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	785.3120721927942
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	1218.429439833666
Father
Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
east.	1192.0350199123397
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.	1422.9003666723756
Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?	592.3640888758189
Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
farther footpath along which she sailed.	1165.7475112699096
And Father Conmee smiled and
saluted.	946.4248011905837
How did she do?	1196.269654406593
A fine carriage she had.	1096.0237272888298
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	592.3640888758189
And to
think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	729.8353763913527
such a queenly mien.	2003.164377960204
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
shutup free church on his left.	1141.8949896369202
The reverend T.	592.3640888758189
Greene B.A.	592.3640888758189
will
(D.V.) speak.	592.3640888758189
The incumbent they called him.	1020.3263795591887
He felt it incumbent on
him to say a few words.	1296.074163975814
But one should be charitable.	1376.803099178944
Invincible
ignorance.	592.3640888758189
They acted according to their lights.	1512.0887476674588
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
road.	796.0650216256839
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
important thoroughfare.	1141.4602579181637
Surely, there ought to be.	467.5321433354382
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	1106.4284526924087
All
raised untidy caps.	1196.3022706333559
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	1168.6469539777734
Christian brother boys.	946.4336915828404
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	928.0433735640075
Saint
Joseph’s church, Portland row.	592.3640888758189
For aged and virtuous females.	1376.861144421135
Father
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	801.2723897892113
Virtuous: but
occasionally they were also badtempered.	1616.6651563492594
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
nobleman.	903.5708892067134
And now it was an office or something.	1001.8435067617246
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	1027.2887677748315
Father
Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	1355.52394992509
He passed Grogan’s the
Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
catastrophe in New York.	1108.0858376274257
Still, an
act of perfect contrition.	1250.410629225777
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged.	1213.056020410211
They saluted him and were saluted.	1512.0433627362058
Father Conmee passed H.	592.3640888758189
O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny
Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	1269.613769075377
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
the constable.	879.2897704352853
In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
tubes.	1442.932115195414
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
him.	1659.8398531992984
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out
and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
people.	1641.6872630749285
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	657.5729930730699
of saint Francis
Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
tram.	1083.0947696331639
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	1122.247124704992
of
saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	790.884613913506
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	1339.7970512620989
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
his purse.	1695.2831802022274
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket
inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away
the ticket.	1919.5470655475153
Father Conmee liked
cheerful decorum.	1039.41860477134
It was a peaceful day.	1376.5709772363066
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	1155.40614702507
His wife, Father Conmee
supposed.	592.3640888758189
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
with the glasses.	1058.1351195223813
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so
gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and
smiled tinily, sweetly.	1816.607564185967
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	1298.967729084491
He perceived also that
the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
seat.	1071.5195608215752
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	1580.72638676041
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	1532.3151351093738
The conductor pulled the
bellstrap to stay the car for her.	1361.565676405248
She passed out with her basket and a
marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
cares, poor creatures.	1542.4303677185635
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
Father Conmee.	819.3592391851997
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men
and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	1141.787333080656
and the African mission
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and
brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when
their last hour came like a thief in the night.	1436.1553133812224
That book by the
Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a
reasonable plea.	809.5730246774654
Those were millions of human souls created by God in
His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.	1123.089818605636
But
they were God’s souls, created by God.	744.9148230284819
It seemed to Father Conmee a
pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	1432.3306570807058
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
conductor and saluted in his turn.	1190.002092564929
The Malahide road was quiet.	1039.41860477134
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	885.1480785295871
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	1082.0132898299269
Lord Talbot de Malahide,
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	1025.3880120986626
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	1640.7724567655473
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old
times in the barony.	1801.5453719109748
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and
of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
Belvedere.	958.6972729887799
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
not startled when an otter plunged.	1406.9628306665793
Not the
jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
her husband’s brother?	1457.6767567674626
She would half confess if she had not all sinned
as women did.	1625.2134570440683
Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.	996.4503452306162
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our
ways.	1343.4532448181897
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	1277.473367046505
He was humane and
honoured there.	1512.138816961438
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
clusters.	2054.6704364000866
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	1271.1242852043895
It was a charming day.	1376.5593390502418
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	1375.3471880650297
The sky showed him a flock of
small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	1624.02279449213
_Moutonner,_ the French
said.	592.3640888758189
A just and homely word.	1376.8572642759873
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
over Rathcoffey.	1263.327210051586
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
Clongowes field.	1274.994095769442
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
evening.	1760.3176344492924
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	1700.0648949413728
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	1452.343634230013
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	1452.58201443406
He should have read that before lunch.	1616.7845981803414
But lady Maxwell had
come.	624.6727911362016
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	889.1448524362254
_Deus in adiutorium._
	1196.3022706333559
He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._
	1525.560118963658
A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	1715.8241232151752
The young man raised
his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	1524.3512992940418
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary.	1746.377870630973
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
formidavit cor meum._
	1694.4595064446853
Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	1779.887494662862
He pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings.	1860.7807423547986
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway.	1213.9667905235658
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	1900.574820778531
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	673.113912170792
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	1501.9850129998051
Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	953.2799970206788
—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	752.0007648251232
—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	592.3640888758189
—It’s very close, the constable said.	1452.7166164201853
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
coin.	1516.5603057747308
—What’s the best news?	600.023906680924
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
bated breath.	1837.121895268848
A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting
Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.	1115.0949657990554
Towards
Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
	1344.9416917393617
—_For England_...	592.3640888758189
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
and growled:
	960.2143374289825
—_home and beauty._
	1142.200379597233
O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in
the warehouse with a visitor.	1145.5230859245805
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
into the cap held out to her.	1553.946417438156
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself
forward four strides.	1815.102996858033
—_For England_...	592.3640888758189
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	2066.508246905791
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
towards a window and bayed deeply:
	1959.4200901136799
—_home and beauty._
	1142.200379597233
The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	1945.9058813327135
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	1392.6235040684376
A card _Unfurnished
Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.	1196.0173216416938
A plump bare generous arm
shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut
shiftstraps.	2047.607285074836
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	1310.4561724096131
It fell on the path.	872.3473840050681
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrel’s cap, saying:
	1467.0844009097727
—There, sir.	592.3640888758189
Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming
kitchen.	756.109676326369
—Did you put in the books?	1250.8364985990834
Boody asked.	592.3640888758189
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	2021.772957732178
—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.	1064.7764804329522
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
tickled by stubble.	1123.8997971174535
—Where did you try?	991.9336382529896
Boody asked.	592.3640888758189
—M’Guinness’s.	592.3640888758189
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	1207.0873790967046
—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	1366.7806405123583
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	1402.8890035270404
—What’s in the pot?	770.6824447543747
—Shirts, Maggy said.	592.3640888758189
Boody cried angrily:
	737.2943990675084
—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	1278.3918671966558
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
	1910.8010302975706
—And what’s in this?	783.241293610236
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	1334.6426329559688
—Peasoup, Maggy said.	592.3640888758189
—Where did you get it?	751.1608254529534
—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	592.3640888758189
The lacquey rang his bell.	1020.3515097631577
Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
	936.1472513172649
—Give us it here.	899.5955950808823
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	1870.627813656121
Katey,
sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
mouth random crumbs:
	1401.4140953093024
—A good job we have that much.	1452.6659255061584
Where’s Dilly?	592.3640888758189
—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	748.7356344482142
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
	1747.721450697402
—Our father who art not in heaven.	1189.3923862116767
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:
	1106.42845269241
A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.	1301.6304288936578
The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling
fibre.	1406.9588315059575
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
and a small jar.	1734.7482303022437
—Put these in first, will you?	1031.5052807476075
—Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	1159.5905213955373
And the fruit on top.	1376.8677657362373
—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	841.8044149445659
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
shamefaced peaches.	1976.4093072592232
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
tomatoes, sniffing smells.	1763.4584000941868
Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
plodding towards their goal.	1262.7516997541375
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
his fob and held it at its chain’s length.	1969.2483925911774
—Can you send them by tram?	1334.6206919015567
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s
cart.	995.5759176572626
—Certainly, sir.	592.3640888758189
Is it in the city?	487.1692655536442
—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	592.3640888758189
Ten minutes.	592.3640888758189
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	1767.6415567875251
—Will you write the address, sir?	1512.1068564557256
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	1283.8268157680914
—Send it at once, will you?	1031.485060198573
It’s for an invalid.	1376.8258487294772
—Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
I will, sir.	737.2943990675084
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.	1280.178659932383
he asked.	168.4727106542555
The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	1767.7466513042427
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	1225.5258767626
A young pullet.	946.4336915828404
He
took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	1767.2478581439482
—This for me?	423.5427882800868
he asked gallantly.	930.6433713967289
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
a bit crooked, blushing.	2047.4990703623473
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	1823.8580150884095
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
red flower between his smiling teeth.	1556.1410259986587
—May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	1107.8580123047877
he asked roguishly.	930.6433713967289
_—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.	592.3640888758189
He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.	869.1384378527894
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
gripping the handrests.	1946.114708830174
Men’s arms frankly round their
stunted forms.	1700.0559118862639
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	1067.1399895589823
—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero
giovine come Lei.	1141.5390698295262
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	1823.8605849571861
È
peccato.	592.3640888758189
Perchè la sua voce...	1196.3022706333559
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	2415.9788711002393
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._
	1039.41860477134
—_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.	1485.8243054970503
_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	1511.9640713460526
_Ma, dia retta
a me.	1376.8650244983396
Ci rifletta_.	592.3640888758189
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	1070.446977287585
—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	1109.8949170985143
—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	841.8114424048898
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly.	885.1534237904042
Human eyes.	592.3640888758189
They gazed curiously
an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	1263.5501951313008
_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	946.4296708024293
_Venga a trovarmi
e ci pensi.	1512.138816961438
Addio, caro._
	946.4336915828404
—_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
was freed.	1216.6396499429247
_E grazie._
	946.4336915828404
—_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	592.3640888758189
_Scusi, eh?	592.3640888758189
Tante belle cose!_
	1196.3022706333559
Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram.	1584.5529351708497
In vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through Trinity gates.	1700.0328228310282
Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
typewriter.	1269.8445206485198
Too much mystery business in it.	1011.54293028767
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	850.6104841572044
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	870.7909364970383
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
six.	1358.8922006771309
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
	931.7186888934244
—16 June 1904.	592.3640888758189
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab
where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	1095.5869682957305
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.	1225.7480826742103
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens
and capital esses.	1674.1092846169913
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	1376.8311130440861
She’s not
nicelooking, is she?	1197.371745416469
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.	1341.9239410422658
If I could get that
dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s.	1085.92840116495
They kick out
grand.	1196.3022706333559
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	1285.4197038490443
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.	1512.2656928060312
The telephone rang rudely by her ear.	1616.7878518796047
Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
No, sir.	592.3640888758189
Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
I’ll ring them up after five.	946.8247135396332
Only
those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	841.7995804967599
All right, sir.	528.9728107352421
Then I can
go after six if you’re not back.	1131.4185238559262
A quarter after.	946.4292464214541
Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
Twentyseven
and six.	507.18726062322924
I’ll tell him.	633.9535991628198
Yes: one, seven, six.	1196.2980565823646
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	1452.7012325490425
—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	692.9853488294347
Mr Lenehan, yes.	592.3640888758189
He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four.	798.37832968681
No, sir.	592.3640888758189
Yes,
sir.	592.3640888758189
I’ll ring them up after five.	946.8247135396332
—Who’s that?	461.5357045536777
Ned Lambert asked.	592.3640888758189
Is that Crotty?	592.3640888758189
—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	1293.4378806359816
—Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	1039.3984919631212
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
pliant lath among the flickering arches.	1746.6114639817472
Come on.	592.3640888758189
Mind your steps
there.	1196.3022706333559
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
soft flame and was let fall.	1925.563213110791
At their feet its red speck died: and
mouldy air closed round them.	1837.1316161002785
—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	1254.2013148133424
—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	748.7545201171381
We are standing in the historic
council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
himself a rebel in 1534.	1191.3782595288721
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	1139.349566387767
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.	928.7096879224598
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their
synagogue over in Adelaide road.	1354.8502431687784
You were never here before, Jack, were
you?	1003.5075049588708
—No, Ned.	592.3640888758189
—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
serves me.	1438.4571025168136
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.	692.5044133719111
—That’s right, Ned Lambert said.	592.3640888758189
That’s quite right, sir.	971.1559555476708
—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
allow me perhaps...	1416.1788736700685
—Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	592.3640888758189
Bring the camera whenever you like.	1103.6563730465552
I’ll
get those bags cleared away from the windows.	1554.9232336610598
You can take it from here
or from here.	1626.5252220914815
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	1398.681991101066
—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	870.841425074483
I won’t trespass
on your valuable time...	1409.6563619039882
—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	724.1084873131331
Drop in whenever you like.	943.5898226742563
Next
week, say.	946.4336915828404
Can you see?	409.6165393890661
—Yes, yes.	592.3640888758189
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	592.3640888758189
Very pleased to have met you.	1512.1006333269595
—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	724.1074093472201
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away
among the pillars.	1800.483681846039
With J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s
abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut
meal, O’Connor, Wexford.	1336.2082615467714
He stood to read the card in his hand.	1067.8206753506665
—The reverend Hugh C.	592.3640888758189
Love, Rathcoffey.	592.3640888758189
Present address: Saint
Michael’s, Sallins.	592.3640888758189
Nice young chap he is.	832.9882808688723
He’s well up in history, faith.	1616.8743395956158
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
twig.	1097.0653774365114
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	1196.8942956866022
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	613.6229032436921
—God! he cried.	647.1690971058431
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	971.6451057079142
You know that one?	991.9248161989723
_I’m bloody
sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the
archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.	955.0397125700347
God, I’ll
tell him anyhow.	989.2655853560289
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	1003.3882203628744
Hot
members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	742.961798528187
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	1823.819379126235
He
slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
	1570.0194124416741
—Woa, sonny!
	592.3640888758189
He turned to J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy and asked:
	841.8025462520168
—Well, Jack.	592.3640888758189
What is it?	338.4313499265509
What’s the trouble?	991.8237828705397
Wait awhile.	592.3640888758189
Hold hard.	592.3640888758189
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
instant, sneezed loudly.	1933.8752148243175
—Chow! he said.	262.36878812105795
Blast you!
	592.3640888758189
—The dust from those sacks, J.	946.4292463762724
O’Molloy said politely.	841.8114424048898
—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	724.1074093472201
cold night before...	1882.0301579797112
blast your
soul...	1652.0581199912547
night before last...	1882.038707005315
and there was a hell of a lot of
draught...	644.5227417805164
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	1699.67222645372
—I was...	592.3640888758189
Glasnevin this morning...	440.40050423935753
poor little...	1366.1107637658338
what do you call
him...	337.39235339886926
Mother of Moses!
	592.3640888758189
Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
claret waistcoat.	1490.0492750483397
Say it’s turn six.	1377.0676982268121
In here, see.	946.4292464214541
Turn Now On.	592.3640888758189
He slid it into the left slot for them.	945.4288251123123
It shot down the groove,
wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	1234.6238766446904
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly
female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
great amplitude.	1433.9611190023552
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	1017.1454814679685
The impact.	592.3640888758189
Leverage, see?	592.3640888758189
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	1294.482327593236
—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	660.8666080985872
Tom Rochford said.	592.3640888758189
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	1856.107014670446
Turn Now On.	592.3640888758189
—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	1156.6837263263749
One good
turn deserves another.	1376.861144421135
—Do, Tom Rochford said.	592.3640888758189
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.	650.6156573795939
—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly.	784.6746171349943
When you two begin...	1196.2938424605543
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	1294.2132853816083
—But how does it work here, Tommy?	1082.0146907613964
he asked.	168.4727106542555
—Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
See you later.	946.4336915828404
—He’s a hero, he said simply.	1173.0435639773625
—I know, M’Coy said.	592.3640888758189
The drain, you mean.	843.0396471333411
Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
It was down a manhole.	1376.831112941367
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	1190.7224350802958
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was.	870.1135719646671
One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,
half choked with sewer gas.	1713.7824509415038
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest
and all, with the rope round him.	1206.1791762998664
And be damned but he got the rope
round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	1427.1776160034754
—The act of a hero, he said.	676.4228044282848
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
them for Jervis street.	1354.271451465731
—This way, he said, walking to the right.	912.5992794222954
I want to pop into Lynam’s to
see Sceptre’s starting price.	1017.1822691055711
What’s the time by your gold watch and
chain?	1509.7775648185975
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at
O’Neill’s clock.	784.6746171349952
—After three, he said.	457.04336643229624
Who’s riding her?	1196.3022706333559
Madden, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
And a game filly she is.	1250.3981431134364
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	1511.6540927246006
Fellow might damn easy
get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	1447.2297754508888
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
cavalcade.	1774.9859735522384
—Even money, Lenehan said returning.	784.6724058811368
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an
earthly.	1408.3556187922331
Through here.	592.3640888758189
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch.	858.7176544206103
A darkbacked figure
scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	1163.3759482674816
—There he is, Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.	964.4391089514077
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.	582.3812480467774
—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said.	801.2895599080873
I was with him one day and he
bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	1505.7964713259025
There were
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
comets with long tails.	1737.4369236703824
Astronomy it was about.	992.1518808177924
Lenehan laughed.	592.3640888758189
Come over
in the sun.	457.7408447687929
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
riverwall.	1277.2400695177453
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s,
carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	790.4629373451942
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
eagerly.	875.3097866233344
The annual dinner, you know.	859.5429937769109
Boiled shirt affair.	946.4336915828404
The lord
mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
Dawson spoke and there was music.	834.2529320500435
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin
Dollard...	592.3640888758189
—I know, M’Coy broke in.	660.8635041589665
My missus sang there once.	1376.861144421135
—Did she?	592.3640888758189
Lenehan said.	592.3640888758189
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number
7 Eccles street.	912.8269347395723
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	1682.55634566347
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	415.17386437356146
Delahunt of Camden street had the
catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	1567.573273167762
Bloom and the wife
were there.	989.6320243958319
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and
curacoa to which we did ample justice.	2066.5785650044672
Fast and furious it was.	947.0946779323739
After
liquids came solids.	1196.3022706333559
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	1512.138816961438
—I know, M’Coy said.	592.3640888758189
The year the missus was there...	1056.8724671349264
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	1185.258127541681
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	415.17386437356146
We had a midnight lunch too after
all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
morning after the night before.	1817.4144178853026
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
night on the Featherbed Mountain.	1042.7802123184638
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	710.0887746721015
We started
singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	1344.9782912530688
She was well
primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband.	1301.3972961086185
Every
jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	1253.777385251566
Like that.	592.3640888758189
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
	1823.8310836438259
—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	1352.4864605989526
Know what I mean?	592.3640888758189
His hands moulded ample curves of air.	1452.7041576437748
He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	1707.4651807965367
—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	1179.9841709478153
She’s a gamey
mare and no mistake.	1342.3171334366468
But, by God, I
was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	1069.2608240083282
At
last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away.	1823.8612542113704
_And what star is that,
Poldy?_ says she.	936.7561218710661
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	592.3640888758189
_That one, is it?_
says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._
By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.	1270.0265801738954
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
laughter.	1747.658443960597
—I’m weak, he gasped.	1376.8650244983396
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	1648.8035284944363
Lenehan
walked on again.	822.5378339061779
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
rapidly.	1767.732903032428
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.	1106.684914136427
—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	1067.5456908694825
He’s not one
of your common or garden...	1392.289114544106
you know...	202.95482009384938
There’s a touch of the artist
about old Bloom.	1196.537541318496
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.	764.8719985034088
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of
slaughtered cows.	1873.106204805375
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the
world.	897.3869650883219
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	713.5970207282649
Child born every
minute somewhere.	1376.8572643548641
Mrs Purefoy.	592.3640888758189
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the
Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	918.8404404539903
—That I had, he said, pushing it by.	1236.9562604780858
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	1116.6732045186359
—Them are two good ones, he said.	932.9751937964467
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	1396.8592149881767
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	1596.3608503168075
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.	1149.6674254703732
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	1082.7668295290857
_Fair Tyrants_ by James
Lovebirch.	592.3640888758189
Know the kind that is.	833.0175996921724
Had it?	592.3640888758189
He opened it.	737.2943990675084
Thought so.	592.3640888758189
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain.	1283.5760793399977
Listen: the man.	647.2481910661045
No: she wouldn’t like that much.	1068.73205268354
Got her it once.	1196.2938424605543
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	841.8089298871622
More in her line.	1196.1352779461065
Let us see.	946.4336915828404
He read where his finger opened.	1512.1006782963448
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
wondrous gowns and costliest frillies.	1935.2697196065692
For him! For Raoul!_
	592.3640888758189
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._
	1738.0290201105327
Take this.	592.3640888758189
The end.	592.3640888758189
—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	1737.6176445536378
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	2003.0295047786858
An imperceptible smile played
round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	1775.8365917502276
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._
	841.8084770402942
Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	1548.081429850304
Flesh yielded amply
amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	1871.079885776621
His nostrils arched
themselves for prey.	1512.1352658891174
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).	841.8114424048898
Armpits’ oniony sweat.	946.4336915828404
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).	1512.1352658891174
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!
	885.1534237904042
Young! Young!
	592.3640888758189
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains.	1576.6878036213566
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing.	1873.2616743521316
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on
the floor.	1152.9770814397923
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along
it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	2018.7394646210685
Mr Bloom beheld it.	841.8114424048898
Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
	796.1548609525677
—I’ll take this one.	1020.3362888729397
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	1700.0589060500763
—_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it.	914.7481007935291
That’s a good one.	569.3889442970537
The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.	1394.3806163053853
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,
the cries of the auctioneer within.	1695.4423873241606
Four and nine.	556.580376554311
Those lovely
curtains.	946.4336915828404
Five shillings.	592.3640888758189
Cosy curtains.	592.3640888758189
Selling new at two guineas.	1376.853384062898
Any advance on five shillings?	1040.6293479198837
Going for five shillings.	699.0526095079994
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
	1474.2027663054723
Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	1910.8184658445007
Jackson, W.	592.3640888758189
Wylie, A.	592.3640888758189
Munro and H.	592.3640888758189
Gahan, their stretched
necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	1344.9802817989716
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.	1196.2633137490345
He halted near his daughter.	1185.2522778488967
—It’s time for you, she said.	1043.6741109847467
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	897.3936498986996
Are
you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
shoulder?	1328.156121945605
Melancholy God!
	592.3640888758189
Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	1196.3022706333559
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
held them back.	1338.248638657182
—Stand up straight, girl, he said.	796.1586004236092
You’ll get curvature of the spine.	1616.0837618915239
Do you know what you look like?	775.2730175255426
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
and dropping his underjaw.	2026.6243593186089
—Give it up, father, Dilly said.	748.8008568419982
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	1538.1299661223575
—Did you get any money?	1376.8416155268014
Dilly asked.	592.3640888758189
—Where would I get money?	675.4917508349126
Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	686.0996507487201
—How do you know that?	367.77569161600826
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	1182.4637437652864
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
James’s street.	1072.396354401078
—I know you did, Dilly answered.	748.7474864952692
Were you in the Scotch house now?	724.7010273513373
—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling.	729.9707861285461
Was it the little nuns
taught you to be so saucy?	1295.9890622499804
He handed her a shilling.	1185.217269231848
—See if you can do anything with that, he said.	518.1485941021555
—I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	795.3037861129901
Give me more than that.	1040.588392741546
—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	748.7545201171381
You’re like the rest of
them, are you?	792.3671078583997
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor
mother died.	1747.8728706625334
But wait awhile.	647.1873352442567
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long
day from me.	1721.3757962738584
Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you.	698.947712400003
Wouldn’t
care if I was stretched out stiff.	1106.4219748672874
He’s dead.	593.5180519795749
The man upstairs is dead.	971.1724582608853
He left her and walked on.	974.035709835305
—Well, what is it?	283.24921913491715
he said, stopping.	940.1420371481895
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	1409.7035443372527
—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	905.8723927584138
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell
but feebly:
	1976.137995845141
Mr Dedalus stared at him.	569.0877433520142
—Watch him, he said.	322.0700303832616
It’s instructive.	946.4336915828404
I wonder will he allow us to
talk.	1409.6669461951371
—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	842.407504764134
—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	803.5163608200825
I’ll leave you
all where Jesus left the jews.	1040.0012909097072
Look, there’s all I have.	748.8477765176002
I got two
shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
funeral.	1051.9902809134412
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	1481.0470033179809
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere?	1548.145463077469
Dilly said.	592.3640888758189
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	894.7820434885651
—I will, he said gravely.	1096.555632471005
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell
street.	964.3757673057426
I’ll try this one now.	1512.1210612500947
—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	885.1516420694318
—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	1196.2917354480476
Get a glass of milk
for yourself and a bun or a something.	1590.4848207408204
I’ll be home shortly.	1185.25616572016
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	1242.4538241415023
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
Parkgate.	1353.6664854859846
—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	1018.0477657895811
The lacquey banged loudly.	1196.3022706333559
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
mincing mouth gently:
	1855.7561141229542
—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do
anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!
	689.4046637925475
From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with
the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s
street, past Shackleton’s offices.	845.2164533138475
Got round him all right.	812.003704889727
How do you
do, Mr Crimmins?	522.9872486779726
First rate, sir.	946.4336915828404
I was afraid you might be up in your
other establishment in Pimlico.	1479.8240480894972
How are things going?	1196.3033680726708
Just keeping
alive.	946.4292464214541
Lovely weather we’re having.	1376.816600483894
Yes, indeed.	592.3640888758189
Good for the country.	745.5863413151654
Those farmers are always grumbling.	1376.853384062898
I’ll just take a thimbleful of your
best gin, Mr Crimmins.	1187.0125194818063
A small gin, sir.	1196.3022706333559
Yes, sir.	592.3640888758189
Terrible affair that
_General Slocum_ explosion.	592.3640888758189
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	784.6746171349943
And heartrending scenes.	946.4336915828404
Men trampling down women and children.	1197.4641279113196
Most
brutal thing.	946.4336915828404
What do they say was the cause?	1452.5513930763043
Most scandalous revelation.	946.4336915828404
Not a single lifeboat would float and the
firehose all burst.	1870.495762339998
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever
allowed a boat like that...	1503.4419731162914
Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	795.3163006829784
You know why?	737.2943990675084
Palm oil.	592.3640888758189
Is that a fact?	460.66130657222766
Without a doubt.	647.1873352442567
Well now, look
at that.	895.8847824914283
And America they say is the land of the free.	750.6232410469013
I thought we
were bad here.	1512.089678967633
I smiled at him.	621.2766810677015
_America,_ I said quietly, just like that.	758.3448054697792
_What is
it?	338.4313499265509
The sweepings of every country including our own.	1700.0439342489203
Isn’t that true?_
That’s a fact.	808.6415530546805
Graft, my dear sir.	899.5819892194195
Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s
always someone to pick it up.	1593.004892624602
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	1512.0889830717683
Dress does it.	528.9560683471097
Nothing like a dressy
appearance.	1376.572511268439
Bowls them over.	946.4292464214541
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
How are things?	737.2909362695849
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	643.0330603354844
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
Kennedy, hairdresser.	1196.2610616354102
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	943.587182221294
Scott of Dawson
street.	592.3640888758189
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.	717.9109925532401
Never built
under three guineas.	1376.8572643548641
Fits me down to the ground.	567.3362222618986
Some Kildare street
club toff had it probably.	1298.6073519748893
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
remembered me.	1179.455969423309
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	1236.653966571789
Knight of the road.	548.112927052708
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
again, sir.	1156.0805058969852
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
has it.	1747.19222088766
North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on
the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	1305.081431895249
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	1298.5593840073175
High colour, of course.	674.0876531051346
Grizzled moustache.	592.3640888758189
Returned Indian officer.	592.3640888758189
Bravely he bore his stumpy
body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	1782.6862802577834
Is that Ned
Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam?	805.7141912500498
He’s as like it as damn
it.	1299.552080810023
The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	1370.0884989516167
Just a flash
like that.	771.2678757693186
Damn like him.	737.2805475510427
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	1545.8458231090635
Good drop of gin, that was.	977.063304691655
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to
his fat strut.	1823.635519013226
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	1089.3568301760279
Greasy black rope.	946.4336915828404
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife
drove by in her noddy.	1429.6118707295611
Bad times those were.	1196.2896282679212
Well, well.	592.3640888758189
Over and done with.	991.9623833266351
Great topers too.	946.4336915828404
Fourbottle men.	592.3640888758189
Let me see.	507.1974084853489
Is he buried in saint Michan’s?	885.1480786020281
Or no, there was a midnight
burial in Glasnevin.	850.8034777110695
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
wall.	1164.208567839657
Dignam is there now.	803.3626079662181
Went out in a puff.	1095.5653492554582
Well, well.	592.3640888758189
Better turn
down here.	991.9684619306007
Make a detour.	946.4336915828404
Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the
corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom.	946.4743881331456
Outside the Dublin
Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey
stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	1505.2364013748286
Damn dangerous thing.	946.4336915828404
Some
Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	1279.7945739475415
Runaway
horse.	592.3640888758189
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for
the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	1144.6806793394753
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	592.3640888758189
Times of the troubles.	1195.3570270365067
Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.	1017.176575460326
When you look back on it all now
in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	1234.076624247559
Gaming at Daly’s.	592.3640888758189
No
cardsharping then.	946.4336915828404
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the
table by a dagger.	1582.7276196560672
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from
major Sirr.	692.5033291971034
Stables behind Moira house.	592.3640888758189
Damn good gin that was.	815.2481857186419
Fine dashing young nobleman.	1196.3022706333559
Good stock, of course.	674.0894092709882
That ruffian, that
sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	1795.454980807134
Course they were on
the wrong side.	926.6478516708557
They rose in dark and evil days.	1616.787005205828
Fine poem that is:
Ingram.	784.6724058811368
They were gentlemen.	946.4336915828404
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
touchingly.	1322.652515656349
Masterly rendition.	592.3640888758189
_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._
	1029.8423339176657
A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
leaping in their, in their saddles.	1226.4666476062605
Cream sunshades.	592.3640888758189
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	1196.3022706333559
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	894.6918626521671
Damn it! What a
pity!
	784.6597134783756
Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s
fingers prove a timedulled chain.	1823.7174781449382
Dust webbed the window and the
showtrays.	1373.1225390432478
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	1767.6810199424128
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on
rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	2066.6028183624603
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
shining in the darkness.	1445.2422836809553
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
them.	1823.8631548295793
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	1870.6672458318453
A sailorman,
rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	1870.9509505382632
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	2066.4809493838916
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned
it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.	1228.444307218236
Grandfather ape
gloating on a stolen hoard.	1616.558308147781
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	1823.4235875172603
The brainsick words
of sophists: Antisthenes.	946.4248010098522
A lore of drugs.	1196.2980565823661
Orient and immortal wheat
standing from everlasting to everlasting.	1267.1395189157433
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	1549.8364684320152
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	1534.3689719970162
Beingless beings.	592.3640888758189
Your heart you sing of.	1376.861144421135
I
between them.	593.5096891166162
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	1196.2854133190676
Shatter them, one and both.	1376.832339790655
But stun myself too in the blow.	1374.2002168182348
Shatter me
you who can.	1376.83398347697
Bawd and butcher were the words.	1250.3827935520449
I say! Not yet awhile.	784.6746171349943
A
look around.	946.4336915828404
Yes, quite true.	737.2943990675084
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.	1700.0678893036218
You
say right, sir.	773.3005077364667
A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.	1196.3022706333559
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
his shoulderblade.	1385.8413074838215
In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
boxing Sayers held his eye.	729.7326662607152
Staring backers with square hats stood
round the roped prizering.	1823.838929720347
The heavyweights in tight loincloths
proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	1946.1104901731053
And they are
throbbing: heroes’ hearts.	1512.0546434835226
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	1547.6898365975726
—Twopence each, the huckster said.	1376.8650244983396
Four for sixpence.	946.4336915828404
Tattered pages.	592.3640888758189
_The Irish Beekeeper.	592.3640888758189
Life and Miracles of the Curé of
Ars.	592.3640888758189
Pocket Guide to Killarney._
	592.3640888758189
I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes.	1767.8551799399675
_Stephano Dedalo,
alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._
	1322.66050282485
Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.	1376.7417380827185
Binding too good probably.	1196.3022706333559
What is this?	593.5083534005756
Eighth and ninth book of
Moses.	946.4336915828393
Secret of all secrets.	1196.3097150430344
Seal of King David.	592.3640888758189
Thumbed pages: read
and read.	1376.8155916465882
Who has passed here before me?	1334.6300957845515
How to soften chapped hands.	1376.8650244983396
Recipe for white wine vinegar.	1376.8650244983396
How to win a woman’s love.	1202.5187047874279
For me this.	946.415910520381
—_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._
	764.8733405781387
Who wrote this?	946.4336915828404
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
Salanka to all true believers divulged.	1123.6818598820196
As good as any other abbot’s
charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.	1263.5625019880072
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your
wool.	1700.0283039809817
—What are you doing here, Stephen?	749.4850303892
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.	1616.8130418810986
Shut the book quick.	1196.2745116780154
Don’t let see.	1196.2865115175523
—What are you doing?	843.0436924752787
Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	1196.2890330461364
It
glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	1747.8518418240687
I told her
of Paris.	784.6705574382812
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.	1426.0720065172006
_Nebrakada femininum._
	946.4336915828404
—What have you there?	899.587316621961
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
nervously.	1068.9654134786524
Is it any good?	1196.2854142614635
Do others see me so?	1020.3341620609376
Quick, far and daring.	1196.2926057532254
Shadow of my mind.	991.8306095725216
He took the coverless book from her hand.	1366.6941502763964
Chardenal’s French primer.	592.3640888758189
—What did you buy that for?	1250.393148253693
he asked.	168.4727106542555
To learn French?	592.3640888758189
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	1700.0469276002445
Show no surprise.	946.4336915828404
Quite natural.	592.3640888758189
—Here, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
It’s all right.	348.34396156533904
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.	1044.042284748234
I suppose all my books are gone.	1452.7032978418954
—Some, Dilly said.	592.3640888758189
We had to.	946.3904099228101
She is drowning.	946.4336915828404
Save her.	592.3640888758189
All against us.	946.4336915828404
She will
drown me with her, eyes and hair.	1318.4068193150163
Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
my heart, my soul.	1747.8582979493021
Salt green death.	946.4336915828404
Inwit’s agenbite.	946.4336915828404
Misery! Misery!
	592.3640888758189
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
How are things?	737.2909362695849
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	643.0330603354844
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s.	809.5736584060694
Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	1436.4900599015707
—What’s the best news?	600.023906680924
Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	724.1055721776142
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	1597.803657565203
—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
Who is it?	338.4313499265509
—O, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	1616.6577709006576
—With a broken back, is it?	904.2318896339058
Mr Dedalus asked.	592.3640888758189
—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	592.3640888758189
Reuben of that ilk.	991.7944723228875
I’m just
waiting for Ben Dollard.	885.1516420694318
He’s going to say a word to long John to get
him to take those two men off.	966.7060294078846
All I want is a little time.	907.1126393254971
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck.	1486.1984823670257
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	660.8619521472986
Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always
doing a good turn for someone.	1192.0028989835955
Hold hard!
	592.3640888758189
He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	1363.6456850454533
—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	1196.5400420061342
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	1893.5825291189492
He came towards
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	1911.3196214020636
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
	650.6081129979248
—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	1010.1486962917877
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	592.3640888758189
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
Dollard’s figure.	1196.2974545028671
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he
muttered sneeringly:
	1048.0445652303974
—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?	1292.8489251789028
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	1232.5068955503195
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
	1563.4023561695499
—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	907.4738321026066
Thanks be to
God he’s not paid yet.	888.0741916998494
—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	843.2239275024818
Father Cowley asked.	592.3640888758189
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	861.7656685729073
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth
a deep note.	1823.8469144700134
—Aw! he said.	262.36878812105795
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	1048.2960406224022
—What about that?	593.4727193745748
Ben Dollard said.	592.3640888758189
Not too dusty?	946.4336915828404
He turned to both.	1196.3336142792461
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	841.8073804600048
The reverend Hugh C.	592.3640888758189
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles.	1104.7031200405756
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air.	1208.6961726143745
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.	873.3944146070324
I want to show
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	1216.5157615162016
He’s a cross between
Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	841.7385776907951
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.	1452.6961464802182
Come along.	592.3640888758189
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
cost me a fall if I don’t...	1002.0060887782201
Wait awhile...	592.3640888758189
We’re on the right lay,
Bob, believe you me.	783.8561967746076
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	964.3681427994845
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	1911.5705419093101
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?	1616.8228055439395
—He has, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
Dollard said.	1407.6413014508494
The landlord has the prior claim.	1177.9396051290423
I gave him all the
particulars.	997.7207587847251
29 Windsor avenue.	592.3640888758189
Love is the name?	535.8056257466673
—That’s right, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
The reverend Mr Love.	592.3640888758189
He’s a
minister in the country somewhere.	1427.384638926076
But are you sure of that?	714.6396286128046
—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
writ where Jacko put the nuts.	924.596474858166
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	1196.1563313687554
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
glasses on his coatfront, following them.	1269.2326057973467
—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
passed out of the Castleyard gate.	726.7114429795503
The policeman touched his forehead.	1185.2489372710547
—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	724.1084873131331
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards Lord Edward street.	1450.133425840565
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared
above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	786.5170820972972
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	972.1893182772433
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	698.0360971394099
Touch me not.	737.2874734175336
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down Cork hill.	1253.6802924900355
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	637.1924972516327
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	1106.4267204489513
—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
office.	735.7096661845923
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	1110.618014877454
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	870.2041057236088
And put down the
five shillings too.	1616.6805271635803
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	841.7976622169608
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	592.3640888758189
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	946.431468999537
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	1946.4521216319527
They went down Parliament street.	592.3640888758189
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.	748.7545201171399
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
Here goes.	592.3640888758189
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	983.7732682457946
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.	1215.1891930013894
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John
Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	1057.1143099795868
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.	844.914659728175
The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	1275.2249623133987
Martin Cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
glance.	1134.4838032775651
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	1192.01990011394
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted.	1064.057913123939
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	832.1723896493036
He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
their faces.	1384.011346378983
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	1700.070883610277
he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	1197.8959278410127
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
about their damned Irish language.	1095.631081978693
Where was the marshal, he wanted to
know, to keep order in the council chamber.	1613.647125211312
And old Barlow the
macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	1112.3982731264166
Damned Irish language,
language of our forefathers.	1322.5494587542237
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	990.5225016073642
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to
the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
his peace.	1110.3999870662624
—What Dignam was that?	593.189114684569
long John Fanning asked.	592.3640888758189
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	1584.5960792537744
—O, my corns! he said plaintively.	1512.6682527505625
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake
till I sit down somewhere.	1109.9522447457007
Uff! Ooo! Mind!
	592.3640888758189
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
passed in and up the stairs.	1370.0989955917885
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.	686.5690183254854
I don’t think
you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	1572.6560837781044
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	744.911051921871
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	856.3912097084215
—Rather lowsized.	592.3640888758189
Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham
said.	784.6676585581516
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	1081.9795720986772
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	912.7189938612797
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
Martin Cunningham said.	592.3640888758189
All turned where they stood.	1376.830101988472
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	835.337570771162
From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	1427.296430130624
Gaily they went
past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	1686.827386850493
In saddles of the
leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	1767.1507229473104
—What was it?	528.9443708998697
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
staircase.	933.1781553982382
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	845.830044448721
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
Panama to Haines:
	946.4118952640621
—Parnell’s brother.	528.9579056749219
There in the corner.	471.80466386782746
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	1645.598413292668
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	1172.733446876806
—Yes, Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	1106.4145943276496
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	1689.2075560831615
An instant after,
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
fell once more upon a working corner.	2126.0532262984298
—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.	980.6575104744461
—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.	592.3640888758189
And bring us some scones and
butter and some cakes as well.	1795.6450252615198
When she had gone he said, laughing:
	1234.651996211531
—We call it D.B.C.	592.3640888758189
because they have damn bad cakes.	1997.8475017881651
O, but you missed
Dedalus on _Hamlet._
	706.1503581367974
Haines opened his newbought book.	1376.8572642759873
—I’m sorry, he said.	637.651886920251
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
minds that have lost their balance.	1836.9707056958182
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
	1122.1450249142833
—_England expects_...	592.3640888758189
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	1584.4852962441437
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	1701.108011966602
Wandering Ængus I call him.	624.6600097194489
—I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	1452.4940791291285
Now I am speculating what it
would be likely to be.	1073.3254084197772
Such persons always have.	991.9789449784407
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	1322.6613798916587
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	1748.2083037003918
He will never
capture the Attic note.	885.1511191919184
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth.	1031.2917280890626
That is his tragedy.	1196.239052431183
He can never be a poet.	932.7435384667053
The joy of creation...	1196.2938425462191
—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	946.4276025575033
I tackled him
this morning on belief.	1234.3641730744916
There was something on his mind, I saw.	792.3696535263072
It’s
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
interesting point out of that.	970.5376553938908
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	1512.09681481562
He helped her to
unload her tray.	1616.743724116096
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
the cheerful cups.	1354.257149383353
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
of retribution.	1618.855931655653
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	1626.5442694197059
Does he write anything for your movement?	1616.7821899368193
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	1911.1597706206835
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
its smoking pith.	1823.8617291082833
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	1616.7455401623815
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	1617.2852230634514
He is going to write
something in ten years.	907.148826607833
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	1122.796593167289
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.	896.3385076057143
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	1870.3597957863665
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	816.116759396613
I don’t
want to be imposed on.	767.4602927770399
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
from Bridgwater with bricks.	1348.026264925269
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.	608.3037540635889
Behind
him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s
house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	946.4300246374894
Distantly behind him
a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	1091.841964195052
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	994.698932577261
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke’s lawn.	1188.3988970790767
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	819.4531994574675
With ratsteeth
bared he muttered:
	1376.853384062898
—_Coactus volui._
	946.4292464214541
He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	1196.3005850111786
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
having buffeted a thewless body.	1840.3530519047129
The blind stripling turned his sickly
face after the striding form.	1870.9505249437316
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder
nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!
	1020.241981367867
Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been
sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	873.5470188129608
It was too blooming
dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.	1172.5824818838491
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
blooming time and sighing.	2002.5804081399087
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
stopped him.	910.4025062273723
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
pelts and putting up their props.	1874.755883735286
From the sidemirrors two mourning
Masters Dignam gaped silently.	946.4336915828404
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will
meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of
fifty sovereigns.	1060.211838568922
Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.	1322.5510381281176
Myler
Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	1135.964429442902
Two bar
entrance, soldiers half price.	1512.138816961438
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	1700.0507025348195
Master
Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	1190.8277345874967
That’s me in mourning.	1096.1291855477286
When is
it?	338.4313499265509
May the twentysecond.	946.4336915828404
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	1373.8043994315822
He
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap
awry, his collar sticking up.	1084.7071999427083
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he
saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
puckers.	1216.6110989834135
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
out.	1283.8747462386302
The best pucker going
for strength was Fitzsimons.	1196.2959495196046
One puck in the wind from that fellow
would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	1520.5417758379199
But the best pucker
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out
of him, dodging and all.	1071.4372067869542
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
telling him and grinning all the time.	1446.0461703478647
No Sandymount tram.	592.3640888758189
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand.	1091.843104520973
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	1364.8495500873069
The
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
end to it.	1733.5265673352962
He met schoolboys with satchels.	1376.8650244983396
I’m not going tomorrow
either, stay away till Monday.	1277.4994965547178
He met other schoolboys.	1196.3022706333559
Do they notice
I’m in mourning?	675.7689257165882
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.	1158.3177814224885
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
name.	1201.8042258575529
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
fly walking over it up to his eye.	1194.1532251892663
The scrunch that was when they were
screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
bringing it downstairs.	1667.9073477899851
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
the men how to get it round the bend.	1464.2025200272424
A big coffin it was, and high and
heavylooking.	1362.8422018501976
The last night pa was boosed he was
standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to
Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	1667.9686206088409
Death, that is.	409.60727366331344
Pa is dead.	528.9709735797242
My father is dead.	773.2930454127405
He
told me to be a good son to ma.	1067.676367208486
I couldn’t hear the other things he
said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	1504.7731868876685
Poor
pa.	592.3640888758189
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	660.8646006939479
William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the
viceregal lodge.	945.6071441059224
In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs
Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.	839.480817604277
in
attendance.	1661.7125485465108
The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
quays.	1338.0679489208558
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
metropolis.	1477.099209764477
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
him vainly from afar.	1067.6416934002295
Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord
Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
White, B.	903.1030132214322
L., M.	592.3640888758189
White’s,
the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose
with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	1365.260862122735
In the
porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	821.5482959098146
Past Richmond bridge at the
doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously
on the representative of His Majesty.	1279.4793126192835
From its sluice in Wood quay wall
under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
liquid sewage.	1160.2901188502053
Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by
bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired.	870.9999086276324
On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse
for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his
hat low.	1538.4782292793418
His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting.	592.3640888758189
From
Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C.	841.8076068264252
Love, M.	592.3640888758189
A., made obeisance
unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held
of yore rich advowsons.	2047.710029753089
On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking
leave of each other, watched the carriages go by.	1165.900140378388
Passing by Roger
Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,
carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid
up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she
couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s
big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its
being the lord lieutenant.	1241.1907089344484
Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of
Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	1018.7780003982513
The
Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	592.3640888758189
O., passed
Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax
smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_
James.	1003.5278336639091
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the
approach of the cavalcade.	946.2279945863123
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley
fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret
waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	1279.0310877515512
A charming _soubrette,_ great
Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from
her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon
lieutenantcolonel H.	1107.6729860841242
Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald
Ward A.	946.3751785009306
From the window of the D.	548.6514697578848
Buck Mulligan gaily, and
Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders
of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon
John Howard Parnell looked intently.	1335.8345601911699
In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus,
straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw
sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	1128.893194810147
John Henry
Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from
winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in
his fat left hand not feeling it.	1640.739569669216
Where the foreleg of King Billy’s
horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from
under the hoofs of the outriders.	1291.6870624197877
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	1373.7191273787964
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the
second carriage.	1775.6349601415434
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	592.3640888758189
C., agreeably
surprised, made haste to reply.	1452.7275516045595
At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white
flagon H.	1106.4274360141346
halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,
E.L.Y.’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages.	1549.8734189342265
Opposite Pigott’s
music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily
apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.	1262.1755526947404
By
the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl’s a Yorkshire
girl._
	1265.0923978642343
Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high
action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
suit of indigo serge.	1969.4924760530216
His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
the red flower between his lips.	1611.2338148070005
As they drove along Nassau street His
Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
music which was being discoursed in College park.	1219.2019300939082
Unseen brazen
highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_:
	1823.7571876571405
But though she’s a factory lass
	783.6885236076928
And wears no fancy clothes.	751.1917660032691
Yet I’ve a sort of a
	585.1723909417035
Yorkshire relish for
	737.2909362695849
My little Yorkshire rose.	592.3640888758189
Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M.	1293.0268960195185

Stevenson, C.	592.3640888758189
Adderly and W.	592.3640888758189
Huggard, started in pursuit.	1196.2980565823661
Striding
past Finn’s hotel Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell
stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr
M.	880.6070308364325
Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.	579.840512158678
Deep in Leinster street by Trinity’s postern a loyal king’s man,
Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap.	1106.415270578874
As the glossy horses pranced by
Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes
being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black
cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper.	1600.990116868932
His collar too sprang up.	1376.8621549029606
In Lower
Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,
passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’s path.	1666.8301273427114
At the Royal
Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips
agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township.	1052.7620212112238
At Haddington road
corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in
which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady
mayoress without his golden chain.	1841.456034182545
On Northumberland and Lansdowne
roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male
walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the
house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the
Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the
salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing
door.	1427.2428370630205

My eppripfftaph.	592.3640888758189
Be pfrwritt.	592.3640888758189
Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the
crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
steel.	1062.7106234084035
—Is that her?	946.4203558902273
asked miss Kennedy.	946.4170682195913
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._
	1376.7159798230382
—Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	592.3640888758189
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
	705.0304698026747
—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	1208.263368412379
gold asked more eagerly.	2415.9423308214778
—In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the
sun.	986.8236633855424
He’s looking.	946.4336915828404
Mind till I see.	592.3640888758189
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	2002.429094705065
Her wet lips tittered:
	1196.2980565823646
—He’s killed looking back.	1376.853384062898
She laughed:
	592.3640888758189
—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?	1082.0132898299269
With sadness.	592.3640888758189
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
behind an ear.	1787.5837057368167
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
hair.	1692.2044332613712
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	1871.0559177936311
—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	1416.1227064585435
A man.	592.3640888758189
Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of
sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	1160.1235929892855
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	1423.1640354437154
For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.	1763.6820152634675
—There’s your teas, he said.	796.1347774458856
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	1885.1834123023464
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
loud boots unmannerly asked.	2415.9618500781194
—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	1003.524259793509
—Your _beau,_ is it?	742.8732306453417
A haughty bronze replied:
	1196.3022706333559
—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence.	1018.0137700489804
—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
she threatened as he had come.	1636.643660029265
On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
	885.1534237904042
—Most aggravating that young brat is.	1512.117509569745
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	1196.2938424605543
—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	748.7510033694363
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	1632.866119532302
They cowered
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
waiting for their teas to draw.	1712.028751458758
They pawed their blouses, both of black
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
seven.	1736.181683096012
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,
hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	1703.3575892900687
—Am I awfully sunburnt?	841.8114424048898
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	1376.8638858416302
—No, said miss Kennedy.	592.3640888758189
It gets brown after.	1196.3022706333559
Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water?	1823.2633344034473
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
midst a shell.	1770.574270384317
—And leave it to my hands, she said.	833.4486267866754
—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	822.041650661215
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
	944.6319882556163
—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	1767.70316860513
I asked that
old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.	1406.9054024929903
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
	1584.6696827196438
—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!
	1570.3625646552207
—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	692.5299336259657
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
with little fingers.	1512.1203506101301
—No, don’t, she cried.	719.9256632564648
—I won’t listen, she cried.	997.7460568000287
But Bloom?	592.3640888758189
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:
	1298.6302252581704
—For your what?	946.4336915828404
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
again:
	1787.589705868874
—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire.	855.1116281493098
The hideous old wretch! That
night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	652.6516551869566
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	1911.3505996109275
—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
ruffling her nosewings.	1512.190518553473
Hufa! Hufa!
	592.3640888758189
Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat.	1196.2854135589478
Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
snout in quest.	1856.0707889554287
—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	592.3640888758189
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	1452.7194540946045
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
	1512.1293473094063
—And your other eye!
	745.9406215189973
Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name.	689.8406880138184
Why do I always think
Figather?	592.3640888758189
Gathering figs, I think.	592.3640888758189
And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.	946.431468999537
By
Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by.	1122.235202036366
Bluerobed, white
under, come to me.	951.2898960660702
God they believe she is: or goddess.	1616.7836689005246
Those today.	592.3640888758189
I
could not see.	745.9018863929166
A student.	592.3640888758189
After with Dedalus’ son.	592.3640888758189
He might be Mulligan.	592.3640888758189
All comely virgins.	946.4336915828404
That brings those rakes of
fellows in: her white.	1767.6509046039737
By went his eyes.	712.6152265629603
The sweets of sin.	468.835131307598
Sweet are the sweets.	822.5073667055611
Of sin.	592.3640888758189
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
high piercing notes.	1995.0566731160177
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	1823.8631548295793
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled.	1700.0529175653965
Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes.	1734.8892382646145
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her
fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
coughing with choking, crying:
	1806.7007739070552
—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	788.3881639800604
With his bit of beard!
	1096.0813371161246
Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
delight, joy, indignation.	1959.2888144650192
—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	1616.0392703348073
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	2168.3522852673436
And then laughed more.	1196.3022706333559
Greasy I
knows.	592.3640888758189
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	2002.9927812260655
All flushed (O!),
panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	706.1565772035038
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	784.6746171349943
—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	1275.2348118482096
I
wished I hadn’t laughed so much.	1089.3330570300511
I feel all wet.	1196.2854140044617
—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	592.3640888758189
You horrid thing!
	946.4336915828404
And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	1700.0619006452653
By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of
their oils.	1081.9621289512477
Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at
doors as I.	1512.1210609252337
Religion pays.	592.3640888758189
Must see him for that par.	1159.5656221299719
Eat first.	592.3640888758189
I
want.	592.3640888758189
At four, she said.	556.1095549094932
Time ever passing.	946.4336915828404
Clockhands
turning.	592.3640888758189
Where eat?	592.3640888758189
The Clarence, Dolphin.	592.3640888758189
For Raoul.	592.3640888758189
If I
net five guineas with those ads.	1426.0811280425582
The violet silk petticoats.	1196.2938425462191
The sweets of sin.	468.835131307598
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	1512.138816961438
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	748.7545201171381
Chips, picking chips off one of his
rocky thumbnails.	1321.0697729042581
He strolled.	592.3640888758189
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.	784.6746171349943
He held her hand.	773.2548300929101
Enjoyed her holidays?	946.4336915828404
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	1196.2450899370247
Look at the holy show I am.	885.0074163198684
Lying out on the
strand all day.	895.6771689227854
Bronze whiteness.	592.3640888758189
—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
her hand indulgently.	1309.74373180606
Tempting poor simple males.	1196.3022706333559
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	1426.1055941530176
—O go away! she said.	746.0091350479755
You’re very simple, I don’t think.	713.265968197498
He was.	592.3640888758189
—Well now I am, he mused.	946.427023803409
I looked so simple in the cradle they
christened me simple Simon.	1420.8611703468962
And what did the
doctor order today?	1323.7521551292302
—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	1700.042867899717
—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	885.137851205423
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
her crystal keg.	1946.063545529442
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
pouch and pipe.	1133.4802205398053
Alacrity she served.	737.2943990675084
He blew through the flue two husky
fifenotes.	1699.8252695987635
—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	610.562787728699
Must be
a great tonic in the air down there.	1079.7996422038034
But a long threatening comes at
last, they say.	1244.1032498072275
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into
the bowl.	1836.990307038982
None nought said nothing.	991.9754506878854
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
	1082.0132898299282
—_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_
	1182.057237894142
—Was Mr Lidwell in today?	784.6724058811368
In came Lenehan.	592.3640888758189
Round him peered Lenehan.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom reached Essex
bridge.	592.3640888758189
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	724.1084873131331
To Martha I must write.	784.6746171349943
Buy paper.	592.3640888758189
Daly’s.	592.3640888758189
Girl there civil.	946.4336915828404
Old Bloom.	592.3640888758189
Blue bloom is on
the rye.	699.7034313351561
—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	1003.5496268277458
Lenehan came forward.	946.4126227983508
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	633.1233181819009
He asked.	592.3640888758189
She answered:
	592.3640888758189
—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	681.772003416944
She asked.	592.3640888758189
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
gaze upon a page:
	1462.3367993098263
He was not.	737.240184647374
Lenehan round the
sandwichbell wound his round body round.	1767.7372600270132
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?	449.27943957712614
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	1196.2866802245012
To mind her
stops.	1196.3022706333559
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	1870.999112850206
Jingle jaunty jingle.	946.4336915828404
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	1305.1912602731102
She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
	2026.590626790388
—Ah fox met ah stork.	1376.8650244983396
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	1637.556431783182
He droned in vain.	899.5829199274594
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	1322.6120838204731
He sighed aside:
	946.4336915828404
—Ah me! O my!
	592.3640888758189
He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	832.0995094504536
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	1320.3379999571187
—Who may he be?	822.5568239242474
Mr Dedalus asked.	592.3640888758189
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	1376.8650244983396
—Who may he be?	822.5568239242474
he asked.	168.4727106542555
Can you ask?	946.4203558902273
Stephen, the youthful bard.	1196.3033680726708
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	1584.6121920894573
I didn’t recognise him for the moment.	885.402199281867
I hear he is
keeping very select company.	1700.0438717061584
He had.	592.3640888758189
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	1353.674570795864
In
Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the
rhino for the labour of his muse.	1393.5769882785569
—The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	753.2316602799044
The ponderous pundit, Hugh
MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel
boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of
the O’Madden Burke.	1410.931854122017
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
	946.4266197359236
—That must have been highly diverting, said he.	1029.6890557731047
He see.	592.3640888758189
He drank.	592.3640888758189
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	1376.8650244983396
Set down his
glass.	899.5480573223005
He looked towards the saloon door.	1511.9708499896772
—I see you have moved the piano.	1305.2656966692668
—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	1329.7190813683694
—Is that a fact?	460.66130657222766
—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy?	784.6690695611147
The real classical, you know.	859.5429937769109
And blind too,
poor fellow.	1096.1074506023012
Not twenty I’m sure he was.	658.475822072179
—Is that a fact?	460.66130657222766
Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
He drank and strayed away.	1376.861144421135
—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	782.8857173226056
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.	1010.6358073013162
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.	1767.6951999211065
To the door of the bar and
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of
Ormond.	657.394669296177
Lager without alacrity she served.	1020.3572606531001
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
jinglejaunty blazes boy.	1064.0589582725443
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the
oblique triple (piano!) wires.	1845.6058372582536
He pressed (the same who pressed
indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the
thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in
action.	1926.3401282213617
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in
Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought.	892.591009954689
Are you not
happy in your home?	694.1792921874337
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	1626.212661593183
Means
something, language of flow.	1376.838873119047
Was it a daisy?	1196.2492235102422
Innocence that is.	409.60727366331344
Respectable girl meet after mass.	1376.8650244983396
Thanks awfully muchly.	946.4336915828404
Wise Bloom
eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	1650.412085613619
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	932.8515037183068
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	946.4336915828404
For
some man.	946.4203558902273
For Raoul.	592.3640888758189
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat
riding on a jaunting car.	1485.742936066134
It is.	592.3640888758189
Third time.	592.3640888758189
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	1344.7180444297153
Risk it.	592.3640888758189
Go quick.	592.3640888758189
At four.	592.3640888758189
Near now.	592.3640888758189
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	1237.5141292655487
I was forgetting...	946.4292464214541
—And four.	592.3640888758189
At four she.	737.2909362695849
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	592.3640888758189
Bloo smi qui go.	1196.3022706333559
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?	1318.324554870634
Does that to all.	991.9647789012871
For men.	592.3640888758189
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	1626.5607691720163
That was a tuningfork the
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	1873.539452333856
A call again.	946.4336915828404
That he now
poised that it now throbbed.	1700.0908878974371
You hear?	592.3640888758189
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	1823.8631548295793
Longer in dying call.	1196.2980565823646
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
Douce.	1929.3455420850485
—_The bright stars fade_...	1196.3033680726708
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
	1452.7312373276823
_the morn is breaking._
	2079.6938843154226
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
hands.	1871.079885776621
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s
leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.	2040.9564592391657
—_The dewdrops pearl_...	946.4336915828404
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	1911.1825347736124
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	1095.3461320061315
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	1452.295257097071
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily rose.	1406.9588313819502
—Did she fall or was she pushed?	1616.8146395369743
he asked her.	435.162320802785
She answered, slighting:
	946.4336915828404
—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.	1513.0675938979377
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode.	1235.9241133686064
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	1155.2125278264286
Lenehan heard and
knew and hailed him:
	1616.8065328714567
—See the conquering hero comes.	1376.8650244983396
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
hero.	1103.3244669375754
See me he might.	991.9296187892201
The seat he sat on: warm.	1250.425216689736
Black wary hecat
walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	1262.7603139802263
—_And I from thee_...	841.8114424048898
—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	1003.4960164481323
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	1344.769153742583
She smiled
on him.	663.7724574071783
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
hair, a bosom and a rose.	2026.452596004262
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	841.8114424048898
—What’s your cry?	1196.2359350520996
Glass of bitter?	946.4248011905848
Glass of bitter, please, and a
sloegin for me.	1351.8896379323064
Wire in yet?	946.4292464214541
At four she.	737.2909362695849
Who said four?	946.4336915828404
Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s
office.	1171.0397495910681
Goulding a chance.	647.1812560548422
What is he doing in the Ormond?	873.5325902900059
Car waiting.	592.3640888758189
Where off to?	737.2788882654531
Something to eat?	647.1668489137246
I too was just.	1196.275705100421
In here.	592.3640888758189
What,
Ormond?	592.3640888758189
Best value in Dublin.	592.3640888758189
Is that so?	489.3841106234864
Sit tight there.	946.4336915828404
I think I’ll join you.	946.4336915828393
Come on.	592.3640888758189
Richie led on.	946.4203558902273
Bloom
followed bag.	946.4336915828404
Dinner fit for a prince.	895.684489858427
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
bust, that all but burst, so high.	1757.2690526175923
—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	1003.5238977821097
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	1911.353428424219
—Why don’t you grow?	729.0374871944397
asked Blazes Boylan.	592.3640888758189
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
syrupped with her voice:
	2016.4683979266756
—Fine goods in small parcels.	1376.8650244983396
That is to say she.	836.0491869790179
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	1376.8495037818602
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.	592.3640888758189
He pitched a broad coin down.	1512.1352658891194
Coin rang.	592.3640888758189
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	592.3640888758189
—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	1616.8032779464124
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	1106.4392245835352
Fancy of a friend of mine.	714.9539510816787
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	1811.2480156005472
The eastern seas.	946.4292464214541
Clock whirred.	592.3640888758189
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
bearing away teatray.	1700.0599460052774
Clock clacked.	592.3640888758189
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	1196.3005850111801
Clock clacked.	592.3640888758189
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
and hummed and handed coins in change.	1598.0314156857125
Look to the west.	991.11596774972
A clack.	592.3640888758189
For
me.	592.3640888758189
—What time is that?	624.4476918422971
asked Blazes Boylan.	592.3640888758189
O’clock.	592.3640888758189
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged
Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.	1322.5995766841495
—Let’s hear the time, he said.	763.8623569836257
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered
tables.	841.8114424048908
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table
near the door.	1158.4731630936064
Be near.	592.3640888758189
At four.	592.3640888758189
Has he forgotten?	946.4292464214541
Perhaps a trick.	946.4248011905848
Not
come: whet appetite.	1196.3022706333559
I couldn’t do.	1196.1882334345394
Wait, wait.	592.3640888758189
Pat, waiter, waited.	946.4248011905848
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.	1067.38485566124
—Go on, pressed Lenehan.	592.3640888758189
There’s no-one.	544.9186063918035
He never heard.	946.4081773076155
_to Flora’s lips did hie._
	1322.653208931919
High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	1557.7561656175565
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes
Boylan’s flower and eyes.	1327.9536140176426
—Please, please.	592.3640888758189
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	1616.8260600451579
—_I could not leave thee_...	1185.213059597495
—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	784.6746171349943
—No, now, urged Lenehan.	592.3640888758189
_Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There’s no-one.	659.3808487408705
She looked.	592.3640888758189
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	1040.1833083061576
Sudden bent.	592.3640888758189
Two kindling
faces watched her bend.	1512.124612505629
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
and lost and found it, faltering.	1833.7765600250557
—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_
	592.3640888758189
Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	1692.209907653277
Taunted
them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	1700.070883610277
_—Sonnez!_
	592.3640888758189
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.	1868.3604742994323
—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan.	946.4292463762724
Trained by owner.	946.4292464214541
No sawdust
there.	946.4336915828404
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	1429.6208584116396
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	1823.854213721563
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	946.4336915828404
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	2066.5507714439073
His spellbound
eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with
sunnier bronze.	1988.3880488473897
Yes, bronze from anearby.	1196.3105593065306
—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.	795.3158797035696
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	885.1521060800952
I wanted to tell you.	591.1711385732544
Tom Rochford...	592.3640888758189
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	841.8218168337919
Lenehan gulped to go.	773.3434469052405
—Got the horn or what?	1096.0912013875213
I’m coming.	946.4248011905848
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	2098.549436887357
—How do you do, Mr Dollard?	522.9872486779726
How do?	592.3640888758189
How do?	592.3640888758189
Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an
instant from Father Cowley’s woe.	1196.2823877101966
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.	1089.3406961637518
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	1236.1295636791065
We’ll put a barleystraw in
that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.	1262.7398398010262
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
eyelid.	1291.7230524699899
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	724.1084873131331
Come on, Simon.	592.3640888758189
Give us a
ditty.	1196.2317198861247
We heard the piano.	991.9482893491805
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	1426.103082325823
Power for Richie.	592.3640888758189
And Bloom?	592.3640888758189
Let me see.	507.1974084853489
Not make him walk twice.	1376.820480435573
His corns.	592.3640888758189
Four now.	592.3640888758189
How warm this black is.	1376.861144421135
Course nerves a bit.	698.1294152536108
Refracts (is it?) heat.	1196.4078369436334
Let me see.	507.1974084853489
Yes, bottle of cider.	1196.2738683575353
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
I was only vamping, man.	1376.8360031849834
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	724.1084873131331
Begone dull care.	946.4336915828404
Come, Bob.	592.3640888758189
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
hold him now) into the saloon.	1352.1232624162346
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	795.1545600696154
His
gouty paws plumped chords.	1376.8650244983396
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	946.4336915828404
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	1228.5155944888797
Bothered, he wanted
Power and cider.	660.8681600265427
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	1268.3035717000541
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	1196.3022706333559
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	1616.6763253216084
He’s off.	946.4248011905848
Light sob of breath Bloom
sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	1275.0673595052112
He’s gone.	593.5228089795995
—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	592.3640888758189
God be with old times.	1001.2671221003919
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight.	1599.6976549869958
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	2002.6024377552205
She drew down
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar
where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast
inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of
shadow, _eau de Nil._
	1722.6417524201856
—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
them.	946.3707108628234
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
Collard grand.	1092.3422257811483
There was.	592.3640888758189
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	766.5403653689309
The devil wouldn’t stop him.	1039.6932128384908
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	1572.6057227149292
—God, do you remember?	563.6181208378138
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
punished keyboard.	1094.8245852657965
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	832.1192674726169
They laughed all three.	1196.2980565823661
He had no wed.	1196.272770789106
All trio laughed.	946.4336915828404
No wedding
garment.	737.2943990675084
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	869.1362111354085
Where’s
my pipe, by the way?	868.8034656640384
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	1417.8441697336707
Bald Pat carried
two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	809.5736584060694
And Father Cowley laughed again.	784.6701945885609
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	724.1055721776142
—You did, averred Ben Dollard.	592.3640888758189
I remember those tight trousers too.	1512.1352658891174
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	946.2674748559979
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	1425.8956649467495
Tight trou.	592.3640888758189
Brilliant ide.	592.3640888758189
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	566.1659705150382
The wife was playing the piano in
the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	1417.3444254421802
Do you
remember?	647.1737201894969
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap
in Keogh’s gave us the number.	1206.668445897142
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	1512.1352658891194
—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	1584.611320171434
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	1123.843102060345
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	946.431468999537
He
wouldn’t take any money either.	1616.784398885805
Any God’s quantity of cocked hats
and boleros and trunkhose.	1342.3249747863615
—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	592.3640888758189
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
all descriptions.	1185.2752694867984
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	1376.7022642879463
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	1185.2789994627644
Liver and bacon.	946.4248011905848
Steak and kidney pie.	991.9798549087706
Right, sir.	592.3640888758189
Right, Pat.	592.3640888758189
Mrs Marion.	592.3640888758189
Met him pike hoses.	548.5467113781468
Smell of burn.	946.4292464214541
Of Paul de Kock.	592.3640888758189
Nice
name he.	946.4248011905848
—What’s this her name was?	1512.0731937073724
A buxom lassy.	946.4336915828404
Is she alive?	946.4336915828404
—And kicking.	592.3640888758189
—She was a daughter of...	1185.017228698664
—Daughter of the regiment.	1195.3654486092223
—Yes, begad.	592.3640888758189
I remember the old drummajor.	1376.6615610693843
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
	1512.1364495789662
I don’t know, faith.	806.105599903925
Is she, Simon?	592.3640888758189
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.	1700.0678893036218
—Buccinator muscle is...	946.4336915828404
Bit rusty...	592.3640888758189
O, she is...	647.1478434699682
My Irish
Molly, O.	592.3640888758189
—From the rock of Gibraltar...	593.0545259772572
all the way.	355.82921697209923
Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.	592.3640888758197
Pat served, uncovered dishes.	1196.3022706333559
Leopold cut liverslices.	946.4336915828404
As said before
he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes
while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then
kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.	1442.4056504567848
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.	1082.0148286574565
Dinners fit for princes.	899.5994943384316
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.	1474.8429055187237
Have you
the?	556.5372953512614
Have you the?	556.5372953512614
Haw haw horn.	946.4336915828404
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
chords:
	1196.3022706333572
—_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	1177.9866397142282
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.	1292.9827889323224
You’re the warrior.	1196.2896282679212
—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.	592.3640888758189
I was thinking of your landlord.	1197.3380917132838
Love or
money.	946.4292464214541
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	1823.8416230841906
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	1560.042872981465
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.	1018.0039236354927
He would.	592.3640888758189
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.	766.558003722044
Half time, Ben.	592.3640888758189
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.	913.8109223236265
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.	1364.174122034996
She
passed a remark.	1196.2812001841874
It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful
weather.	1548.079299759147
They drank cool stout.	991.9824392102742
Did she know where the lord lieutenant
was going?	1456.1253116209866
No, she couldn’t say.	943.5304850612433
But it would be in the paper.	467.0673912370768
O, she need not trouble.	1376.8533842206493
She
waved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord
lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten.	1365.358962593212
Too much
trouble, first gentleman said.	1334.6332301010423
Lord lieutenant.	592.3640888758189
Gold by bronze heard iron steel.	1512.1281635529294

I care not foror the morrow._
	1584.6741484591532
In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes.	885.1534237904042
Love and War someone is.	784.6746171349943
Ben Dollard’s famous.	841.8084770704346
Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit
for that concert.	1976.3702361293942
Trousers tight as a drum on him.	1037.3692546323703
Molly did laugh when he went out.	1039.6549883209032
Threw herself back across the bed,
screaming, kicking.	1409.6801308181807
With all his belongings on show.	699.859990859735
O saints above,
I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so
many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone.	963.1415897317315
For
instance eunuchs.	946.4336915828404
Wonder who’s playing.	1196.246736042653
Nice touch.	592.3640888758189
Must be Cowley.	592.3640888758189
Knows whatever note you play.	1376.853384062898
Bad breath he has, poor chap.	1334.5685523197963
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
Lidwell, gentleman, entering.	819.3565749043969
Good afternoon.	592.3640888758189
She gave her moist (a
lady’s) hand to his firm clasp.	1333.2881752925052
Yes, she was back.	1196.2350815329687
To the
old dingdong again.	1376.700361047221
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.	748.7545201171381
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.	1322.6525155481024
Bloom ate liv as said before.	1103.6563912073477
Clean here at least.	991.9528092434282
That chap in the
Burton, gummy with gristle.	783.634086399612
No-one here: Goulding and I.	592.3640888758189
Clean tables,
flowers, mitres of napkins.	1512.138816961438
Pat to and fro.	646.0918374666192
Bald Pat.	592.3640888758189
Nothing to do.	461.537228643754
Best value in Dub.	592.3640888758189
Piano again.	592.3640888758189
Cowley it is.	345.8160364225982
Way he sits in to it, like one together,
mutual understanding.	1747.8562580558398
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the
bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache.	1690.8670411840644
Her high long snore.	1196.3022706333559
Night we were in the box.	632.9163106953202
Trombone under blowing like a grampus,
between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.	2002.8621355252833
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy.	1616.8162963626678
Do right to hide
them.	1376.826093350547
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.	1196.2938424605543
Only the harp.	946.4348492096655
Gold glowering light.	946.4336915828404
Girl touched it.	946.4336915828404
Poop of a
lovely.	1195.265725964865
Gravy’s rather good fit for a.	1323.6085806984033
Golden ship.	592.3640888758189
The harp that
once or twice.	1056.8991244389968
Cool hands.	592.3640888758189
Ben Howth, the rhododendrons.	698.0336383257707
We are their
harps.	1196.2980565823646
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.	903.0803344373859
—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled.	724.1084873131331
Get it out in bits.	812.3335628076843
—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.	592.3640888758189
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
arms outheld.	1976.3973723299189
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.	1547.7216710086645
Softly
he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a
ship, a sail upon the billows.	1276.1959354954552
A lovely girl, her veil awave
upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.	1724.210641304431
Cowley sang:
	592.3640888758189
_—M’appari tutt’amor:
Il mio sguardo l’incontr..._
	1122.2528748785053
She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
wind, love, speeding sail, return.	1597.8351991424267
—Go on, Simon.	592.3640888758189
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben...	1196.3022706333559
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
touched the obedient keys.	1856.1641260966408
—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned.	592.3640888758189
Play it in the original.	450.99436849833694
One flat.	592.3640888758189
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.	1767.7688841065128
Up stage strode Father Cowley.	592.3640888758189
—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said.	570.7210963841799
Get up.	592.3640888758189
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.	1064.0536352054667
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
and Goulding.	1219.2098047633758
Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.	1109.9538602900589
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
heard Joe Maas sing that one night.	946.4192102993393
Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes.	592.3640888758189
In his way.	647.1598769616168
Choirboy style.	592.3640888758189
Maas was the boy.	803.2163042570254
A lyrical tenor if you like.	1103.6867724760016
Never forget it.	737.2840105113547
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.	1584.6412316969288
Backache he.	592.3640888758189
Bright’s bright eye.	1196.3022706333559
Next item on the programme.	1095.803179292745
Paying
the piper.	946.4336915828404
Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.	1700.0460500532122
Stave it off
awhile.	1196.2760634799838
Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate.	870.8131984753968
Kidney pie.	592.3640888758189
Sweets to the.	945.3594018119035
Not making much hand of it.	898.2479016774345
Best value in.	946.436832206606
Characteristic of him.	397.801619384629
Particular about his drink.	1196.2780832210783
Flaw in the
glass, fresh Vartry water.	724.9265069813432
Fecking matches from counters to save.	1512.1290883859974
Then
squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.	1409.7060272290998
And when he’s wanted not a
farthing.	1268.6424746556693
Screwed refusing to pay his fare.	1512.118977074383
Curious types.	592.3640888758189
Never would Richie forget that night.	690.7606330371223
As long as he lived: never.	1512.006644065524
In
the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.	758.2343970676977
And when the first note.	1185.0027099450672
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.	660.8619521472986
Coming out with a whopper now.	1333.9024077077318
Rhapsodies about damn all.	1196.2896282679212
Believes his
own lies.	1196.1101439886145
Does really.	592.3640888758189
Wonderful liar.	592.3640888758189
But want a good memory.	1376.727055722373
—Which air is that?	624.4483373727753
asked Leopold Bloom.	592.3640888758189
—_All is lost now_.	1196.3252849753378
Richie cocked his lips apout.	1376.8780611948653
A low incipient note sweet banshee
murmured: all.	1700.070883610277
A thrush.	592.3640888758189
A throstle.	592.3640888758189
Is lost.	592.3640888758189
Rich sound.	592.3640888758189
Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.	1083.2476050817631
Taking my
motives he twined and turned them.	1700.0507021854255
All most too new call is lost in
all.	1557.4311751077287
How sweet the answer.	1196.2949399367567
How is that done?	1196.2691211093556
All lost now.	556.5856043712156
Mournful he whistled.	946.4336915828404
Fall, surrender, lost.	946.4336915828404
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.	1946.0090124742078
Yes, I remember.	592.3640888758189
In sleep she went to him.	1031.5500142143458
Innocence
in the moon.	514.3281581384551
Don’t know their danger.	1376.8607173359387
Still hold her back.	991.9649677110086
Call
name.	592.3640888758189
Touch water.	592.3640888758189
Jingle jaunty.	592.3640888758189
Too late.	592.3640888758189
She longed to go.	773.3434469052405
That’s
why.	737.2933828658961
As easy stop the sea.	849.9275957553031
Yes: all is lost.	544.9434869656205
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.	724.1084873131331
I know it well.	899.5819898635887
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.	730.4945229568415
He knows it well too.	1376.8677658708343
Or he feels.	946.4248011905848
Still harping on his daughter.	1185.1587420643664
Wise
child that knows her father, Dedalus said.	832.1207337077652
Bloom askance over liverless saw.	1376.861144421135
Face of the all is lost.	894.7551004114605
Rollicking
Richie once.	592.3640888758189
Jokes old stale now.	1196.3022706333559
Wagging his ear.	647.1759683021767
Napkinring in his
eye.	484.3018241149049
Now begging letters he sends his son with.	1700.052818677146
Crosseyed Walter sir I
did sir.	748.7545201171381
Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money.	1018.0588957639997
Piano again.	592.3640888758189
Sounds better than last time I heard.	885.1383155527919
Tuned probably.	592.3640888758189
Stopped again.	592.3640888758189
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	1253.7393267124585
—With it, Simon.	592.3640888758189
—It, Simon.	592.3640888758189
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
solicitations.	1344.970394494512
—It, Simon.	592.3640888758189
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	1597.3161296812902
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	1465.7136847316174
The harping chords of prelude closed.	1512.1352658891194
A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
drew a voice away.	1700.010891855974
—_When first I saw that form endearing_...	919.3737469555028
Richie turned.	592.3640888758189
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.	481.37108633384605
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	2083.670050754426
Bloom signed to
Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the
bar.	891.0345057595524
The door of the bar.	527.9926564266916
That will do.	647.1729285535438
Pat, waiter, waited,
waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	1319.5687473964513
—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._
	1616.8241246237737
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	1959.420115125524
When first they saw,
lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect
it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	1467.8257327732842
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.	967.4255332022485
Bloom unwound slowly the
elastic band of his packet.	1767.388552389131
Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	1260.0300246980262
Bloom
wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	2137.9794574329844
—_Full of hope and all delighted_...	1334.650032172373
Tenors get women by the score.	1511.6164858331795
Increase their flow.	946.4336915828404
Throw flower at his
feet.	861.8538613327346
When will we meet?	822.5444790930511
My head it simply.	641.2117026651254
Jingle all delighted.	946.4336915828404
Your head it simply swurls.	719.6978809299593
Perfumed for him.	392.54559667747543
What perfume does your wife?	520.4975354367007
I want to know.	528.0260185585066
Last
look at mirror always before she answers the door.	1418.79841459546
The hall.	592.3640888758189
How
do you?	647.464288475488
I do well.	946.4336915828404
Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,
in her satchel.	1699.9462342254574
Hands felt for the opulent.	712.9148056068747
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	1823.9268025427477
—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...	1376.8650244983396
Glorious tone he has still.	1020.2827990567071
Cork air softer also their brogue.	1512.138816961438
Silly
man! Could have made oceans of money.	1037.3734856692402
Singing wrong words.	946.4336915828404
Wore out his
wife: now sings.	1512.090411014545
But hard to tell.	899.607965908876
Only the two themselves.	1196.205241252955
If he
doesn’t break down.	1043.0641329978469
Keep a trot for the avenue.	1334.244264643893
His hands and feet sing
too.	1512.081994162923
Nerves overstrung.	592.3640888758189
Must be abstemious to sing.	1376.8398837024358
Jenny Lind
soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream.	1646.6018208703472
For creamy dreamy.	946.4336915828404
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed.	1700.0678893036218
That’s the
chat.	1196.1151489379445
Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.	1196.3005850111786
No: it’s what’s behind.	1103.9072863521446
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.	1376.8650244983396
Tipping her tepping her
tapping her topping her.	1700.070883610277
Pores to dilate dilating.	1196.3022706333559
The joy
the feel the warm the.	1616.7967689099169
To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes.	1616.832749838321
Flood,
gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob.	1376.8650244983396
_ray of hope is_...	2415.9810874215336
Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse
unsqueaked a ray of hopk.	1579.798497801132
_Martha_ it is.	345.8160364225982
Just going to write.	641.2015030357406
Lionel’s song.	946.4292464214541
Lovely
name you have.	699.0526220203686
Can’t write.	946.4292464214541
Accept my little pres.	1196.2812000128506
Play on her
heartstrings pursestrings too.	1511.9762956213622
She’s a.	737.1198663324325
I called you naughty boy.	626.1430258991692
Still
the name: Martha.	592.3640888758189
How strange! Today.	592.3640888758189
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.	1003.524259793509
It sang again to
Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to
wait.	921.3413989833999
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,
how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.	1196.3535916113947
Wish I could see his face, though.	920.1228606881103
Explain better.	592.3640888758189
Why the barber in
Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.	1039.2997084373276
Still
hear it better here than in the bar though farther.	1576.0705721830952
—_Each graceful look_...	946.4336915828404
First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure.	735.3763405902237
Yellow,
black lace she wore.	1376.8495037818602
Musical chairs.	592.3640888758189
We two the last.	842.9932373321715
After her.	592.3640888758189
Round and round slow.	1196.2822972017104
Quick round.	592.3640888758189
We two.	592.3640888758189
All looked.	592.3640888758189
Down
she sat.	946.4292464214541
Lips laughing.	592.3640888758189
Yellow knees.	592.3640888758189
—_Charmed my eye_...	946.4336915828404
_Waiting_ she sang.	946.4336915828404
I turned her music.	1196.2980565823661
Full voice of perfume
of what perfume does your lilactrees.	1270.299552730856
Bosom I saw, both full, throat
warbling.	1322.66050282485
First I saw.	592.3640888758189
She thanked me.	946.4336915828404
Why did she me?	1196.2738683575353
Spanishy

Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in
shadow Dolores shedolores.	1196.2912305189718
At me.	592.3640888758189
—_Martha! Ah, Martha!_
	592.3640888758189
Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant
to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony.	1747.1987660601856
In
cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel.	1911.3703370947514
Here there try there here all try where.	1700.0648949413728

Co-ome, thou dear one!_

Martha, chestnote, return!
	946.4336915828404
_—Come!_

It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver
orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out
too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high
resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high,
of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere
all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...	2265.3301260909707
—_To me!_
	737.2840105113547
Well sung.	592.3640888758189
All clapped.	592.3640888758189
She ought to.	737.3511669969524
To me, to him, to

—Bravo! Clapclap.	592.3640888758189
Good man, Simon.	592.3640888758189

Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square.	963.299445449123
Too
slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.	714.5149847493951
An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.	1192.458711464984
And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,
Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two
more tankards if she did not mind.	1095.546434519729
Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,
coral lips, at first, at second.	1584.6613318555892
She did not mind.	822.4748254223371
—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water.	979.3363139096349
Then you’d
sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.	1106.2943363945462
Lionel Simon, singer, laughed.	841.8114424048898
Father Bob Cowley played.	592.3640888758189

Tom Kernan strutted in.	841.8114424048898
Lydia, admired,
admired.	946.4336915828404
But Bloom sang dumb.	841.8114424048898
He remembered
one night long ago.	1087.3410894500835
Never forget that night.	745.9281674687987
Si sang _’Twas rank and
fame_: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas.	743.0008470861707
Good God he never heard in all his life
a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so
clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice
lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.	1402.671323618448
Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang _’Twas rank and fame._
	789.6492844755377
He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom,
of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _’Twas rank and
fame_ in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.	639.8118822046212
Brothers-in-law: relations.	1196.2738683575353

Rift in the

Treats him with scorn.	991.942141506603
He admires him all the more.	825.0319457011205
The night Si sang.	592.3640888758189
The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,
more than all others.	1911.3438774641322
That voice was a lamentation.	1376.574856495803
Calmer now.	592.3640888758189
It’s in the silence after you
feel you hear.	1312.1923898777004
Now silent air.	946.4336915828404
Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the
slender catgut thong.	1976.3767074624864
He drew and plucked.	1196.3022706333559
It buzz, it twanged.	1196.3022706333559
While
Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan,
harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening
Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played.	1135.2529347062632
While
big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he
smoked, who smoked.	997.7089497294573
Thou lost one.	647.1842956733051
All songs on that theme.	1376.8252569615388
Yet more Bloom stretched his
string.	946.4336915828393
Cruel it seems.	647.1885907908255
Then tear asunder.	946.4336915828404
Knock on the head.	745.6971358543326

Are you not happy in

It snapped.	592.3640888758189
Jingle into Dorset street.	592.3640888758189
Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.	1426.1131295590228
—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.	1946.074710659866
George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.	1320.6872593072067
First gentleman told Mina that was so.	675.775514325723
And
second tankard told her so.	1512.1216440943674
That that was so.	745.955205375567
Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not

A pad.	592.3640888758189
He went.	592.3640888758189
A
pad to blot.	1196.3022706333559
He heard, deaf Pat.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line.	1293.4744028585194
It certainly is.	946.4292464214541
Few lines will do.	899.5774073216461

It’s so characteristic.	1196.2727713031366
—Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.	749.0198633544619
—It is, Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
Numbers it is.	345.8160364225982
Two multiplied by two

Vibrations: chords those are.	1196.2854140044617

Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a

Wish they’d sing more.	1376.822340700769
Keep my mind off.	1196.2907259115884
Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins.	1426.109603265073

She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time.	1452.5866233312584
And look at the lovely shell
she brought.	1161.8922497465835
To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding
seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.	1154.1671002799333
—Listen! she bade him.	1196.2896282679212

Hear! He heard.	592.3640888758189
She held it to her own.	958.8348578327234
And through the sifted light pale gold in
contrast glided.	1823.6395045182442
To hear.	592.3640888758189
He heard more
faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for
other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.	2033.3629956287184
Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.	1626.3862607600179
Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there.	1823.7150304754834
Been to the seaside.	1195.2794803117554
Lovely seaside girls.	507.20155176138826

The sea they think they hear.	1512.114884219337
A roar.	592.3640888758189

hearing: then laid it by, gently.	1646.5891644978572
—What are the wild waves saying?	1512.0562383562974
he asked her, smiled.	888.2996548741123
Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.	706.1578209475638

She nobly
answered: with a gentleman friend.	1373.1156212415378

Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look
at us.	1198.4486544458343
That’s joyful I can feel.	748.7527617590957
My joy is other
joy.	1376.8650244983396
But both are joys.	1196.2980565823646
Yes, joy it must be.	770.3151448581284

Could make a kind of pun on that.	1004.1359848706755
It
is a kind of music I often thought when she.	805.0147067169222
Acoustics that is.	409.60727366331344
Because the acoustics, the
resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the
law of falling water.	1096.9415605468296

By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,
by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze
and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so
lonely Bloom.	1604.2838754714278
Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard.	1196.3429434597465
You who hear in peace.	1096.115912565737
Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people.	1351.6115581097522

Dollard, yes.	592.3640888758189
Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard.	1003.5065840211125
He sang that song lovely,

—Will lift your glass with us.	1512.1281636973065

I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.	972.242462893264
at the
corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along
and he near drove his gear into my eye.	1326.5493890265368
I turned around to let him have
the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony
Batter only Joe Hynes.	1046.1996297961798
—Lo, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
How are you blowing?	1196.3207046429382
Did you see that bloody
chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	1562.404465599481
—Soot’s luck, says Joe.	784.6746171349943
Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?	1496.4270919813848
—Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	703.6780326492257
I’m on two minds not to give that
fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and
ladders.	1872.3292403712965
—What are you doing round those parts?	1323.7611814760548
—Devil a much, says I.	784.6724058811368
There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving
me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to
pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
street.	1214.692379165448
—Ay, says I.	592.3640888758189
A bit off the top.	1096.0087684806222
An old plumber named Geraghty.	784.6746171349943
I’m
hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a
penny out of him.	1020.9739637322788
—That the lay you’re on now?	1305.2808987043393
—Ay, says I.	592.3640888758189
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful
debts.	1039.5581651320188
But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a
day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of
rain.	1718.5033176587644
_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him
summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst.	1286.286734447695
Jesus,
I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	1309.6349941192318
_He drink me

He eat me my sugars.	1376.8378625310465
Because he no pay me my moneys?_

For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s
parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter
called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	1027.9731350722807
Geraghty,
esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,

the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as
this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors,
trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs,
successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	1737.6909970183515
—Are you a strict t.t.?	1512.0783238508957
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	1082.0132898299269
—What about paying our respects to our friend?	1474.2086359073235
says I.	592.3640888758189
Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.	990.8346224323908
—Drinking his own stuff?	1196.1101439886145
—Ay, says I.	592.3640888758189
Whisky and water on the brain.	1334.3065013350597
—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
I want to see the citizen.	458.07091106893034
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I.	1082.000221090497
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	784.6746171349943
—Not a word, says Joe.	784.6939236746167
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	955.5043632970312
—What was that, Joe?	592.3640888758189
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	549.459996308443
I want to
give the citizen the hard word about it.	1229.1658010619103
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
courthouse talking of one thing or another.	1121.5603036387145
Decent fellow Joe when he
has it but sure like that he never has it.	1237.6032969241937
Jesus, I couldn’t get over
that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	1156.671314278679
For trading without a
licence, says he.	737.329408788763
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	1151.910837660925
There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	1700.0560784021998
A pleasant
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated.	2207.0137953703297
In the mild breezes of the west and of the
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	1938.5222613728445
Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing
the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects
as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts
of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful
insects.	2006.0814959625325
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to
Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht
the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of
Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the
sons of kings.	1061.6676044471017
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
descended from chieftains.	1919.5395003507413
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	816.7207221829319
Come out here, Geraghty, you
notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
	1275.2311193699654
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance
of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins
and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great
hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	1815.4519054374616
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
load of papers, working for the cause.	1552.96165693493
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	1362.3636547124604
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that
bloody dog.	1433.713819007522
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off
a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
about a licence.	1780.6007449524652
—Stand and deliver, says he.	723.7384296083742
—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.	779.5824380411349
Friends here.	592.3640888758189
—Pass, friends, says he.	535.4331908093715
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
	728.127092037925
—What’s your opinion of the times?	1452.025512657571
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	913.4562682424087
But, begob, Joe was equal to
the occasion.	812.5603655240377
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
fork.	1933.8585974265175
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
	1516.2964878511957
—Foreign wars is the cause of it.	823.9540619374138
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
	790.81012886953
—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	885.1480785295871
—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	946.4307281395971
I’ve a thirst on me
I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.	1203.0147192735044
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	1081.9876047045425
—Wine of the country, says he.	661.0934482191158
—What’s yours?	946.4248011905848
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	592.3640888758189
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
And how’s the old heart, citizen?	1189.2206475769917
says
he.	202.33180754613653
—Never better, _a chara_, says he.	884.776440917871
What Garry?	592.3640888758189
Are we going to win?	878.3673412055824
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	1370.1920049328285
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
hero.	1756.3419818875875
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	1765.53335177559
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	1943.4587440840119
The eyes in
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	1854.5110648023365
A powerful current of warm
breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his
mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations
of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the
summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to
vibrate and tremble.	2134.17406736573
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	2168.3667046395744
Beneath this he wore trews of
deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	1871.078479043442
His nether extremities were
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast.	1766.6061688487048
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled
at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with
rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and
heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine
hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane
O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh
O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael
Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley,
Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain
Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	935.2926084752689
Fursa, S.	592.3640888758189
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone,
the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of
Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn’t, Benjamin Franklin,
Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	592.3640888758218
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish,
Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell,
Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the
Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	592.3640888758182

Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva,
The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky
Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa, Don
Philip O’Sullivan Beare.	592.3640888758146
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested
by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe
whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which
his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a
mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	1994.5651339678477
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	1290.3991393629765
O, as true as
I’m telling you.	721.5947495087943
A goodlooking sovereign.	946.4336915828404
—And there’s more where that came from, says he.	1179.913728941598
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	946.3437841226387
’Twas the prudent member gave me the
wheeze.	1155.171602176668
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	1030.2882600302896
Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour?	1196.2955280560975
O’Bloom, the
son of Rory: it is he.	531.58873346124
Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the
prudent soul.	1263.2451404164376
—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised
organ.	872.158805987633
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	740.1023273724036
And look at
this blasted rag, says he.	986.3027554534415
Look at this, says he.	723.7057921383403
_The Irish
Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s
friend.	1015.5427956618191
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland
Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.	1084.3491937808003
And he starts reading them out:
	990.209348636567
—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s
on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	642.9006567560118
How’s that, eh?	843.0537996431965
Wright
and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
dean of Worcester.	617.0300041859911
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:
Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the
Moat house, Chepstow...	739.5782920235316
—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	1018.0449543808026
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	669.2935288457019
How’s that for a national press, eh, my
brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	958.3166159717414
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	1003.5040634699136
Thanks be to God they had
the start of us.	990.2650932749361
Drink that, citizen.	737.2943990675084
—I will, says he, honourable person.	1334.7667353296931
—Health, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
And all down the form.	1376.737122454574
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	1449.6165111079135
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
fairest of her race.	2160.762053150735
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s
snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	945.6732503338275
And who was sitting up there in
the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
Doran.	1021.7399568127558
I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
door.	763.5000600063246
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter
and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting
like a poodle.	1586.362853593108
I thought Alf would split.	784.6746171349943
—Look at him, says he.	526.2953659887099
He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a
postcard someone sent him with U.	1196.0112862403732
p: up on it to take a li...	1522.4723308357147
And he doubled up.	1196.2938424605543
—Take a what?	946.4336915828404
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	1065.0597652649574
The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you
seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	1754.633315485051
_—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.	755.0786527784447
—Breen, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round
to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round
to the subsheriff’s for a lark.	903.5743129627667
O God, I’ve a pain laughing.	1082.0029667839724
p: up.	261.28801817388336
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody
old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	1388.841161554246
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	869.5947237701089
—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	748.7545201171381
Is that Alf Bergan?	592.3640888758189
—Yes, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Wait till I show you.	624.6714892490231
Here, Terry, give us a
pony.	825.1747925963184
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	724.7035650172604
You should have seen
long John’s eye.	832.1064588876443
And he started laughing.	1196.3022706333559
—Who are you laughing at?	878.3839403343306
says Bob Doran.	592.3640888758189
Is that Bergan?	592.3640888758189
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full
of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
deathless Leda.	1476.236980453856
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	2208.01986590763
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	1731.541089893529
But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a
testoon of costliest bronze.	1823.827677977034
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork
was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of
Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of
God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress
of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the
wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to
the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	1265.5147516885825
—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
down outside?	1313.2200601800682
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	1017.9853485611726
Hangmen’s letters.	946.4336915828404
Look at here.	737.2909362695849
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his
pocket.	1165.2744520862418
—Are you codding?	946.4336915828404
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Honest injun, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Read them.	592.3640888758189
So Joe took up the letters.	737.9388067623008
—Who are you laughing at?	878.3839403343306
says Bob Doran.	592.3640888758189
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	626.8131079408982
Bob’s a queer chap when
the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:
	1482.625142448275
—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	592.3640888758189
—I don’t know, says Alf.	605.8158996690801
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
Dignam.	811.8950937759433
—You what?	592.3640888758189
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	947.2656458570405
With who?	592.3640888758189
—With Dignam, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Is it Paddy?	592.3640888758189
—Yes, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Ay, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—Who’s dead?	593.5180519795749
says Bob Doran.	592.3640888758189
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	1196.2840089391261
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Good Christ, only five...	841.8084770704346
And Willy Murray
with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s...	1076.7495832917214
—What about Dignam?	592.3640888758189
says Bob Doran.	592.3640888758189
Who’s talking about...?	899.5670281962435
—Dead! says Alf.	592.3640888758189
He’s no more dead than you are.	1076.868123667445
—Maybe so, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
They took the liberty of burying him this morning
anyhow.	1627.2566420164123
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Ay, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	966.9799690715687
—Good Christ! says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	1283.7253118759913
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	1997.7382546878728
Communication was
effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the
orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar
plexus.	1980.6286541655777
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the
heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return
but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty
entities on the lower astral levels.	1617.4709292195223
In reply to a question as to his
first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously
he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	1927.2479075111664
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the
spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort
such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	1810.4386220642227
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
afforded relief.	1782.676114981267
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted
all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true
path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were
out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	1581.6894673099043
It was
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are
still in the body.	1569.587045782644
Mind C.	592.3640888758189
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained
that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	1058.2309967292297
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the
defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment
arrangements.	1423.8665680115867
Before departing he requested that it should be told to
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for
was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair
should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still
good.	1580.4437016729653
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in
the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made
known.	1905.9012226207751
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
intimated that this had given satisfaction.	1733.4244751906665
He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning.	1196.246491836904
Fleet was
his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	1148.5975547213634
Wail, Banba, with
your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	1196.2499835626531
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	947.3363244096467
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Bloom, says he.	324.0231264178809
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten
minutes.	1071.3355882317333
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	1579.7639031655108
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	1039.4156756356856
Faith, he was.	489.4560147059871
—Good Christ! says he.	376.77249114311104
I could have sworn it was him.	1305.4010916080417
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:
	939.4311036839107
—Who said Christ is good?	784.6657718872434
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	946.4374844085286
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
Dignam?	741.8465100561122
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	1106.3895947783885
He’s over all his troubles.	1512.1102593452079
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	445.2113930763822
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	833.7893701296548
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	1792.770726193636
And Bob
Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.	866.3849151231459
The tear is bloody near your eye.	1323.768792725131
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	1544.350860983777
—The noblest, the truest, says he.	884.7785187115711
And he’s gone, poor little Willy,
poor little Paddy Dignam.	709.8037838946804
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
beam of heaven.	1518.2232485685033
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
the door.	920.8853176506963
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.	836.6639660307691
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	671.4784668808779
Listen to
this, will you?	870.0330400063575
And he starts reading out one.	1103.635656234988
_7 Hunter Street,
Liverpool._
	592.3640888758189
_To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
	592.3640888758189
Dublin._
	592.3640888758189
_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
hanged..._
	1222.857566483517
—Show us, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
—Jesus, says I.	592.3640888758189
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._
	841.8084770402942
The citizen made a grab at the letter.	1222.22801479767
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
terms is five ginnees._
	1804.8399864615237
Master Barber._
	592.3640888758189
—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	974.056674780182
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	1293.0119730065592
Here, says he, take them
to hell out of my sight, Alf.	1142.2510508786552
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you
have?	915.2253543397729
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and
he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said
well he’d just take a cigar.	1383.7586134829164
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	838.4525128225921
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with
a black border round it.	1332.8807100878566
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	2137.742217940174
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his
heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	1668.3485189966207
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	1795.1775293788025
Their
deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
saith the Lord.	1521.0415971124253
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those
jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about
I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	1156.5907980327145
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	1479.8191446747276
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.	1449.22045533586
—God’s truth, says Alf.	784.6701945885609
I heard that from the head warder that was in
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	986.0414467892376
He told me when
they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
a poker.	1931.2496886968197
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	1196.2887854825728
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	1196.2691040203383
It’s only a natural
phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...	810.1340426341335
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science
and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	1685.4392973235335
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
	1923.8277809638325
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe
with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported
for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,
that and the other.	1385.2679920720948
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all
round the place and scratching his scabs.	1683.2342585429171
And round he goes to Bob
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could
get.	1188.3918223810624
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
	863.5797581390111
—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
here! Give us the paw!
	716.2366216808376
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	1652.8028544267643
Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to
bring.	1177.0328652524217
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more.	1535.2947430292975
Near ate the tin and all, hungry
bloody mongrel.	1767.7726503169088
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
she’s far from the land.	916.1122721913497
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	1690.0813921477272
Phenomenon! The fat heap he
married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	1787.7571504639836
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me
there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating
meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and
taking the lout out for a walk.	1430.3171098864996
And one time he led him the rounds of
Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought
him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him
the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near
roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd
that kept the hotel.	1510.7831346360329
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them
off chewing the fat.	933.2453589900612
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but
on the other hand_.	1164.785212355045
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in
Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
samples in the bloody establishment.	1599.6772902827588
—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
glaring at Bloom.	1167.8077628678109
—Ay, ay, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.	1196.5378865584455
What I mean is...	841.8114424048898
—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen.	409.5645784297498
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	1549.6067696062867
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	1410.0729896333614
From the belfries far
and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	2229.1010805693063
The deafening
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	2168.315974379895
A torrential rain
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared
heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest
computation five hundred thousand persons.	1874.7257482548846
A posse of Dublin
Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.	1549.3307873157048
Special quick excursion trains
and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	2002.8738748478352
Considerable
amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
mirth-provoking fashion.	1168.5097138974077
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will
grudge them their hardearned pennies.	1860.3298660320525
The children of the Male and
Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the
scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s
entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the
Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and
motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	1507.559279112098
The viceregal
houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their
Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while
the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald
Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	1494.9218844452396
The delegation,
present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone
(the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his
seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul
Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the
Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha
Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	1026.713353302796

All the
delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
they had been called upon to witness.	1915.2029402626747
An animated altercation (in which
all took part) ensued among the F.	1512.1175304716035
as to whether the eighth
or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s
patron saint.	1199.09319994852
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
and blows were freely exchanged.	1910.6589595716225
The baby policeman, Constable
MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
parties.	1448.48853000275
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to
all and was unanimously accepted.	1775.756346723664
Constable MacFadden was heartily
congratulated by all the F.	974.7648835257143
I., several of whom were bleeding
profusely.	1616.8065328714567
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
senses.	1846.3706575185606
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and
gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	1940.5510916546207
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
Cruentus_.	1257.6695488398793
The arrival of the
worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani
beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	1809.516140152543
It
was exactly seventeen o’clock.	1197.4577715830367
The signal for prayer was then promptly
given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the
commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession
of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his
medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	1685.747019446254
The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	2012.5768560314357
Hard by the block
stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in
a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which
his eyes glowered furiously.	2117.228003380313
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested
the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	1925.3906476516788
On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering
knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially
supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and
Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
precious blood of the most precious victim.	1757.0362626015826
The housesteward of the
amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	2125.8425534367257
Quite an
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and
onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and
invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for
the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital
spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying
wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in
aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’
association as a token of his regard and esteem.	2160.943128208062
The _nec_ and _non
plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into
eternity for her sake.	2000.75479154375
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving
embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	1438.2349159927082
Encouraged by this use of
her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
ardour to reach.	2199.5510314228277
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would
never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips
as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	1840.2174653085717
She
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
pastor, joining in the general merriment.	1832.7130605858824
That monster audience simply
rocked with delight.	1260.0301082116598
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
their hands for the last time.	1407.7360005989083
A fresh torrent of tears burst from
their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being
the aged prebendary himself.	2150.403194579034
Big strong men, officers of the peace and
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
in that record assemblage.	1455.7898656928292
A most romantic incident occurred when a
handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and
genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1819.9387061112213
Every
lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the
occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and
generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most
timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his
blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in
the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	1543.99980146151
Nay,
even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had
blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	1711.7953096083052
With his mailed
gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
	1847.6078012611522
—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	1747.8913893874353
Blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	1372.610785628879
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he
cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	1392.5554933023593
Antitreating is
about the size of it.	761.0200398249594
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down
his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth
of his pint.	1895.7588987717324
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and
oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
entertainment, don’t be talking.	1362.334566053773
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	592.3640888758189
And
then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	1838.6165789236197
And one or two
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
females, hitting below the belt.	1605.8344491707314
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me.	1276.6068357599615
I’d train him by kindness, so I
would, if he was my dog.	1149.694563451007
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
where it wouldn’t blind him.	1856.3351894874293
—Afraid he’ll bite you?	1376.8281137375388
says the citizen, jeering.	635.0805193243779
—No, says I.	592.3640888758189
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	1767.5546900731492
So he calls the old dog over.	1189.2991814772586
—What’s on you, Garry?	675.4878808679093
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	1488.3323705787047
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	1647.4322634702987
Someone
that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono
publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of
that.	1675.0096438785938
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth
is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	1584.7916821057245
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_
of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends
and acquaintances Owen Garry.	1742.6545076462185
The exhibition, which is the result of
years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary
system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	1810.6892792152373
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from
us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and
compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_
resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic
bards.	2080.218310127554
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with
which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym
of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but
rather (as a contributor D.	1669.0311527908311
points out in an interesting
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	1651.6652051881895
We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar
whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we
believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more
than an indication.	1746.376048753023
The metrical system of the canine original, which
recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh
englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will
agree that the spirit has been well caught.	1880.0029216878108
Perhaps it should be added
that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat
slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	1694.5869687646875
The curse of my curses
	1376.6974412001082
Seven days every day
	803.3745491944715
And seven dry Thursdays
	592.3640888758189
On you, Barney Kiernan,
	592.3640888758189
Has no sup of water
	1185.2546368674973
To cool my courage,
	1196.3022706333559
And my guts red roaring
	1376.8650244983396
After Lowry’s lights.	698.0360971394099
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off.	1586.7557766548598
And Joe asked him would he have
another.	1090.1099047118832
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.	1566.5960129724901
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.	1496.4658617276953
Arsing around from one
pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	1736.224314099479
Entertainment for
man and beast.	1376.8289631754449
And says Joe:
	592.3640888758189
—Could you make a hole in another pint?	1474.1494982497952
—Could a swim duck?	1196.3022706333559
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Same again, Terry, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
Are you sure you won’t have anything in
the way of liquid refreshment?	1104.0876973744157
—Thank you, no, says Bloom.	784.6701945885609
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor
Dignam’s.	750.963585657173
Martin asked me to go to the house.	564.9598959846073
You see, he, Dignam, I
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the
policy.	1605.952549140944
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is
landed.	756.2030806265244
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	1700.0435466228134
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.	882.6619180488831
—Whose admirers?	592.3640888758189
—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	706.1516019963296
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
Hungarian privileged lottery.	850.8344705389534
True as you’re there.	812.2834421160219
O, commend me to an
israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	869.1007246392195
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.	1227.231209759135
Choking with bloody foolery.	1196.3022706333559
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic
to tell her that.	1215.4624421295644
Shake hands, brother.	946.4336915828404
You’re a rogue and I’m another.	913.8028738052584
But, should I have overstepped the limits
of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my
boldness.	1783.5534483966376
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
of the cup.	1757.3091854108657
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	1432.9058344882167
The goodness of your heart,
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech.	1827.8130642526605
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	1217.7920999678834
Boosed at five
o’clock.	895.826834379311
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
bobby, 14A.	960.249324120198
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,
drinking porter out of teacups.	1668.1910770187228
And calling himself a Frenchy for the
shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he
serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut,
who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and
smugging.	1197.9125544193585
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed
and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	1547.837700831325
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing
there, I tell you what.	873.0087309889154
Then see him of a Sunday with his little
concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as
pie, doing the little lady.	1953.2321321204045
Jack Mooney’s sister.	841.8084770704346
Gob, Jack
made him toe the line.	1123.8267019333239
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus,
he’d kick the shite out of him.	1007.7227911481784
So Terry brought the three pints.	931.9122444221448
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	946.4003492692924
Here, citizen.	592.3640888758189
—_Slan leat_, says he.	535.4331908093715
—Fortune, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
Good health, citizen.	946.4336915828404
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	1412.6635151481657
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	1228.135299847166
—Friend of yours, says Alf.	784.667983257263
The mimber?	592.3640888758189
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.	1196.2791574432315
—I thought so, says Joe.	784.6783906294486
I saw him up at that meeting now with William
Field, M.	1055.8421571794852
P., the cattle traders.	991.9614733276218
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
all countries and the idol of his own.	1274.5131720723944
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	1502.6380571984578
Because he was up one time in a
knacker’s yard.	1686.5370636537857
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head
and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
for giving lip to a grazier.	1625.930206008749
Mister Knowall.	592.3640888758189
Teach your grandmother how
to milk ducks.	1616.756038042793
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out
with her eight inches of fat all over her.	1220.6135465318282
Couldn’t loosen her farting
strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
it.	1652.7721976132914
What’s your programme today?	1185.2264197030775
Humane methods.	592.3640888758189
Because the poor
animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t
cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	1816.6140346967934
Gob,
he’d have a soft hand under a hen.	1585.4359302538678
Ga Ga Gara.	592.3640888758189
Klook Klook Klook.	592.3640888758189
Black Liz is our hen.	1039.4164384654407
She lays eggs for
us.	833.0454830151048
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	1767.7016679186431
Klook Klook Klook.	592.3640888758189
Then
comes good uncle Leo.	784.6746171349943
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
fresh egg.	1344.9790322780148
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	675.4922465572132
Klook Klook Klook.	592.3640888758189
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	819.1948025995878
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	1018.0694090704002
I wanted to see
him, as it happens.	1409.6942178223167
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	1087.974005740385
—That’s too bad, says Bloom.	946.4203558450425
I wanted particularly.	946.4336915828404
Perhaps only Mr
Field is going.	660.8815012718455
I couldn’t phone.	1196.208205295671
You’re sure?	946.4336915828404
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.	946.4357748003753
The league told him to ask a question
tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
park.	1219.8198207177604
What do you think of that, citizen?	756.2879572038944
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.	592.3640888758189
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	592.3640888758189
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that
these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is
forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	1562.406692939171
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	592.3640888758189
Con.): Honourable members are already in
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
house.	1626.4974725248378
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	1107.1208429148294
The answer to the
honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.	1635.1760429141805
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.	592.3640888758189
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
Phoenix park?	1313.7541347996944
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
bench?	1027.338486719658
(O! O!)
	592.3640888758189
Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	1293.38410413838
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	592.3640888758189
Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.	822.5589667907198
(Ironical opposition cheers.)
	946.4336915828404
The speaker: Order! Order!
	592.3640888758189
(The house rises.	946.4336915828404
—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	778.6111309517918
There
he is sitting there.	1040.6000475173817
The man that got away James Stephens.	714.584735218531
The champion
of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	1275.2294856509927
What was your best
throw, citizen?	1512.1175101472843
—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	865.4743920331323
There was a
time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	924.30857712271
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	946.4276025575022
You were and a bloody sight better.	1452.3229396884649
—Is that really a fact?	909.7642176505261
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, says Bloom.	592.3640888758189
That’s well known.	1196.2727713031366
Did you not know that?	1001.236452722289
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
and building up a nation once again and all to that.	1667.7848873338362
And of course
Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart
violent exercise was bad.	1614.024286307952
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	1436.2651332765217
Do you see that straw?	1040.6611233859333
That’s a straw_.	1196.0951828081782
Declare to my aunt he’d talk
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	1901.4427120549053
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	949.2966235747169
The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions.	1614.9385674378796
After an instructive discourse by
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
forefathers.	1906.8930367880887
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
ages.	1514.5495008608746
The Irish
Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were
heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only
our citizen can sing it.	1911.2184937571499
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its
superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was
vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be
noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives
of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	1767.4779460548184
The
proceedings then terminated.	1196.3022706333559

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
Keogh-Bennett match?	813.5400692803937
—No, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	1081.993792129197
And says Bloom:
	592.3640888758189
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
the eye.	1617.3699258893814
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
the odds and he swatting all the time.	1175.1847663941383
—We know him, says the citizen.	517.6882241337921
The traitor’s son.	749.2840292553223
We know what put
English gold in his pocket.	676.4657216157176
—True for you, says Joe.	675.5083151235269
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
blood, asking Alf:
	1485.2457919802998
—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?	460.72357727321014
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	1089.3696732840672
Heenan and Sayers was only
a bloody fool to it.	1072.8327097298861
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	1057.288244437586
See
the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	1470.273090590126
God,
he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
him puke what he never ate.	1420.9769906623167
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	1459.747289115019
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up
for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	1358.0299608297878
The welterweight sergeantmajor had
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had
been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in
some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	1823.8470959559857
The
soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which
the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the
point of Bennett’s jaw.	1517.1780406221437
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him
with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	1534.3857715257234
The men came to
handigrips.	1376.8403586026875
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout
ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	1666.1980007869827
The
Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he
was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey
and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in
jigtime.	1734.3275503889352
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	1361.632648991982
The two
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	1823.8631548295793
The referee twice
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
footwork a treat to watch.	1526.308911171159
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him
flat.	1898.9469314261821
It was a knockout clean and clever.	1616.572905723932
Amid tense expectation the
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	1373.1943529761118
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	946.7071261398626
I hear he’s
running a concert tour now up in the north.	1276.9593162213719
—He is, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
Isn’t he?	593.5096891166162
That’s quite true.	991.964967016193
Yes, a kind of summer
tour, you see.	873.8203955909083
Just a holiday.	946.4336915828404
—Mrs B.	592.3640888758189
is the bright particular star, isn’t she?	1741.1454967022473
—My wife?	592.3640888758189
She’s singing, yes.	1196.2980565823646
I think it will be a success
too.	1366.6649873723961
He’s an excellent man to organise.	1452.6961465731235
Hoho begob says I to myself says I.	706.1528458327651
That explains the milk in the
cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest.	1800.9674856503573
Blazes doing the
tootle on the flute.	1616.450142085149
Concert tour.	592.3640888758189
Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off
Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to
fight the Boers.	1256.1744719909873
Old Whatwhat.	592.3640888758189
I called about the poor and water rate,
Mr Boylan.	1109.8152081058593
You what?	592.3640888758189
The water rate, Mr Boylan.	592.3640888758189
You whatwhat?	592.3640888758189
That’s
the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip.	1870.976367655282
’Twixt me and you
Caddareesh.	784.6429339058235
Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy.	1122.251437346976
There
grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air.	1593.305594361055
The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.	946.1865769276293
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned
in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
Lambert.	1463.1857725528903
—Hello, Ned.	592.3640888758189
—Hello, Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Hello, Jack.	592.3640888758189
—Hello, Joe.	592.3640888758189
—God save you, says the citizen.	428.089514261073
—Save you kindly, says J.	784.6746171349943
What’ll it be, Ned?	675.4917508349117
—Half one, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
So J.	592.3640888758189
ordered the drinks.	2415.9788711002393
—Were you round at the court?	1177.7743306657626
He’ll square that, Ned, says he.	559.1295878049551
—Hope so, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
Now what were those two at?	1334.610369317474
getting him off the grand jury list
and the other give him a leg over the stile.	1650.3033758888168
With his name in Stubbs’s.	660.8851460349924
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee
orders.	2148.465468778898
Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where
no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with
Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	1045.1237518975092
What’s your name, sir?	1185.2055089258026
Dunne, says he.	324.0231264178809
Ay, and done says I.	784.667983257263
Gob, he’ll come home by weeping
cross one of those days, I’m thinking.	1150.614965480938
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	801.8074639169253
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
p: up.	261.28801817388336
Looking for a private detective.	1376.6173589709572
—Ay, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting
examined first.	1439.4798800115598
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	748.756684288071
God, I’d give anything to
hear him before a judge and jury.	1383.5297746387646
—Was it you did it, Alf?	946.4003511673529
The truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	1438.3772476148183
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	1409.6514958575299
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
against you.	1211.1429194062225
—Of course an action would lie, says J.	1196.2959495196046
It implies that he is not
_compos mentis_.	1244.7557924695973
p: up.	261.28801817388336
_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	724.1117387519101
Do you know that he’s balmy?	1056.9385444930592
Look at his head.	663.7472289512662
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
on with a shoehorn.	1288.616737482491
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	1325.353346468672
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	551.5466032113534
—Pity about her, says the citizen.	517.6718085054359
Or any other woman marries a half
and half.	1432.9813617419054
—How half and half?	745.9353655434326
Do you mean he...	991.9745829361495
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	389.4820005321542
A fellow that’s neither fish
nor flesh.	1700.2869797920139
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.	946.431468999537
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.	389.4820005321542
A pishogue, if you know what
that is.	690.7950067097884
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	1067.9577971397473
And Bloom explaining he meant on
account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old
stuttering fool.	1653.3245081661798
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
bringing down the rain.	1428.7163689478873
And she with her nose cockahoop after she
married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the
pope.	1823.9504543821522
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s
moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal
Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	848.255928134209
And who was he, tell us?	1103.561949763684
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven
shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding
defiance to the world.	1555.3184327148954
—And moreover, says J.	592.3640888758189
J., a postcard is publication.	1376.8572642759873
It was held to be
sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	1386.3320231048372
In my
opinion an action might lie.	1616.8162964949868
Six and eightpence, please.	1196.3182630790375
Who wants your opinion?	1196.2938425462191
Let us drink our
pints in peace.	1373.7990839237807
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.	1747.8270200462384
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
—Good health, Ned, says J.	592.3640888758189
—-There he is again, says Joe.	737.2783288076355
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
secondhand coffin.	1531.580516769967
—How did that Canada swindle case go off?	913.8077032767784
—Remanded, says J.	592.3640888758189
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	1089.4424678940961
Do you see
any green in the white of my eye?	1375.3225662070406
Course it was a bloody barney.	895.2506492750609
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
his own kidney too.	1485.4794298843462
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	1279.3728680657664
—Who tried the case?	843.0710636789207
—Recorder, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	969.3521806264367
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	914.3542711352536
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve
in tears on the bench.	1907.3144451282583
—Ay, says Alf.	592.3640888758189
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for
the corporation there near Butt bridge.	1238.940893360458
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
	1458.504487336006
—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	811.9161605471361
Ten, did you say?	745.9065520568263
—Yes, your worship.	946.4336915828404
And my wife has the typhoid.	1512.053465976818
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
immediately, sir.	1196.2911900099377
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.	1293.4723108721398
How dare
you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor
hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	1340.1081681769663
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
halls of law.	1587.703468314918
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	1571.6280448727478
And to the solemn
court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	978.4028148757673
And he sat
him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
and for the county of the city of Dublin.	1506.686213816916
And there sat with him the
high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of
the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen
and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the
tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte
and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and
true.	527.909481723381
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should
well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined
between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss
the book.	1637.403529113308
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they
swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
rightwiseness.	1073.5585246923738
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
in consequence of information received.	1827.5341768185883
And they shackled him hand and
foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
against him for he was a malefactor.	1730.8469391206183
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
filling the country with bugs.	1254.2335126174928
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first
but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	1399.7189435723417
And so Joe swore high
and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.	1542.8630143163239
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
repetition.	1177.8069790289005
That’s the whole secret.	1185.0594934130459
—Rely on me, says Joe.	784.647357407034
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	869.5330958233037
We
want no more strangers in our house.	1700.0212075624531
—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	708.6923038870623
It’s just that
Keyes, you see.	618.2143135585651
—Consider that done, says Joe.	784.6724058811368
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.	946.3853206518257
—The strangers, says the citizen.	380.41944110447815
Our own fault.	946.4292464214541
We let them come in.	971.130603576906
We brought them in.	991.9667357482858
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
robbers here.	1196.2415681348039
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite
and when.	1507.7941578104044
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all
our misfortunes.	934.7972024730885
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	1056.4822943661434
—Give us a squint at her, says I.	991.9064620913892
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows
off of Corny Kelleher.	898.3580415795152
Secrets for enlarging your private parts.	1512.138816961438
Misconduct of society belle.	1196.2938424605543
Norman W.	592.3640888758189
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling
for her tickles and Norman W.	1417.764892544192
Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter
just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with
officer Taylor.	1658.0997775975634
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
	1039.4171402024822
—There’s hair, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
of that one, what?	1945.972202487866
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
him as long as a late breakfast.	1035.7766365926007
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?	1201.1874743434446
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
about the Irish language?	1347.1146943076815
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,
after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken
solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once
more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided
Gael.	1937.2609180815239
—It’s on the march, says the citizen.	659.6996159201794
To hell with the bloody brutal
Sassenachs and their _patois._
	1190.8801156799284
So J.	592.3640888758189
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting
your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to
impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and
botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	1897.1217115362706
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	548.1542153232459
To hell with them!
The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody
thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature
worthy of the name.	1202.3365076484718
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.	1376.8301013573916
—The European family, says J.	592.3640888758189
I was in Europe with Kevin
Egan of Paris.	592.3640888758189
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language
anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._
	1728.513963579746
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	1767.753835114562
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
	939.5306221756668
He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
silent as the deathless gods.	1940.5944530810625
—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	870.8393669717663
—Who won, Mr Lenehan?	592.3640888758189
says Terry.	592.3640888758189
_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one.	828.0582012272654
A rank outsider.	946.4292464214541
And the rest
nowhere.	1196.3664650846663
—And Bass’s mare?	841.8084770704346
says Terry.	592.3640888758189
—Still running, says he.	535.4331908093715
We’re all in a cart.	873.6450050986826
Boylan plunged two quid
on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.	1210.9707475416278
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
gave me.	770.183588452561
Lord Howard de Walden’s.	592.3640888758189
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan.	784.6848452707037
Such is life in an outhouse.	1512.0704447492617
_Throwaway,_
says he.	335.36470589446935
Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.	1373.7768289025594
Frailty, thy
name is _Sceptre._
	660.8681600265427
So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
luck with his mangy snout up.	1475.145752859064
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.	743.7497260085927
—Not there, my child, says he.	884.7722853028697
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.	946.4336915828393
She’d have won the money only for the
other dog.	1405.5352392323912
And J.	592.3640888758189
and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
sticking in an odd word.	1295.8775892480649
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they
can’t see the beam in their own.	1139.7931093558964
—_Raimeis_, says the citizen.	239.63767426763113
There’s no-one as blind as the fellow
that won’t see, if you know what that means.	1298.0733468591668
Where are our missing
twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
tribes?	1634.92889106731
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite
convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	1125.311625533493
Where are
the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the
Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian
purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?	1075.158759014553
Read Tacitus and
Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.	592.3640888758189
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,
silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,
the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs
duties for the right to fish in our waters.	1276.1401616860346
What do the yellowjohns of
Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?	1557.039385171195
And the beds
of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of
marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?	1632.1419847920977
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.	1192.2981402781656
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.	1632.4283541236073
I
was reading a report of lord Castletown’s...	1106.4232559701684
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	1286.2278015822085
Save the
trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
Eire, O.	960.3176559911196
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.	1089.3250241098208
The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
Valley.	1079.029096730644
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs
Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss
Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche
Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower,
Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel
Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,
Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs
Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of
Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	635.9483510558848
The bride who was
given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked
exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised
silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of
broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,
the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
bronze.	1922.6826407382807
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce
Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a
pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form
of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	1560.2551204426925
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at
the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed
numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of
_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	1595.883682149212
On leaving
the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the
happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,
beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,
mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	1678.1289215579757
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan
will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	900.322908448463
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	541.4670548364152
We had our trade with
Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	978.7990252276478
—And will again, says Joe.	624.6758532786971
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh.	1023.5760596413962
Our harbours that are empty will be full
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a
fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the
O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	983.271863549815
And will again, says he, when
the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own
flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag
afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns
on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	1434.9901541907993
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	887.7203376882803
All wind and piss like
a tanyard cat.	1699.8339423659802
As much as his bloody
life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
holding of an evicted tenant.	1619.01130825316
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	885.1292937721043
What will you have?	699.0650977861333
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	1018.0552402164993
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	902.9492005193148
Terry! Are you
asleep?	841.8114424048898
—Yes, sir, says Terry.	592.3640888758189
Right, sir.	592.3640888758189
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
of attending to the general public.	1634.5289367839935
Picture of a butting match, trying
to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
head down like a bull at a gate.	1755.913815949868
And another one: _Black Beast Burned
in Omaha, Ga_.	592.3640888758189
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing
at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
him.	1333.0104179330096
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
crucify him to make sure of their job.	1432.2865301640193
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
bay?	1386.061542340142
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	660.6081704833376
Hell upon earth it is.	752.5634226041176
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on
the training ships at Portsmouth.	1213.6466087400768
A fellow writes that calls himself
_Disgusted One_.	1003.524259793509
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of
tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend
of a gun.	1984.8610215095578
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on
the breech.	1198.469965293236
—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	1796.3175126694432
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
till he yells meila murder.	1847.018062286612
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
earth.	831.3976046823606
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a
dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	1508.3305638051502
That’s the great empire they
boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	1837.0062431413949
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	1089.30682934925
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	1312.9887625342737
The
unfortunate yahoos believe it.	1096.1004683165088
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was
scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day
he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend
till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be
paid.	1831.6973228380627
—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere.	1293.4843523474572
I mean wouldn’t
it be the same here if you put force against force?	1421.3137301392535
Didn’t I tell you?	489.85865308672487
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his
last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.	1435.311267686126
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.	732.4455795253795
We have our greater
Ireland beyond the sea.	643.6868978778422
They were driven out of house and home in the
black 47.	1008.3592529751385
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
redskins in America.	1319.6404511157443
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	1003.5207247794181
But the
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	1313.8489738529458
Ay,
they drove out the peasants in hordes.	1547.95524170856
Twenty thousand of them died in
the coffinships.	1700.4586395260344
But those that came to the land of the free remember
the land of bondage.	1006.5405076176786
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	1038.7848358479011
But my point was...	1196.2938425462191
—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	1334.5501561130914
Since the
poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
Killala.	976.8726069690547
—Ay, says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	1196.1582919885211
Remember Limerick and the
broken treatystone.	1195.6232843415903
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
wild geese.	999.6550988175643
Fontenoy, eh?	592.3640888758189
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan
in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
Teresa.	677.2326733948101
But what did we ever get for it?	1276.1044185539329
—The French! says the citizen.	287.18504549476734
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what
it is?	515.1816133364979
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	1293.4602272420027
Aren’t they
trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with
perfidious Albion?	898.4658642215196
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	972.1701149827666
—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	841.8114424048898
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George
the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s
dead?	1132.9863819105813
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old
one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every
night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by
the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the
Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	1554.9517781007935
—Well, says J.	592.3640888758189
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	946.4336915828393
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	692.7610338521329
There’s a bloody sight more pox
than pax about that boyo.	1597.811427233927
Edward Guelph-Wettin!
	592.3640888758189
—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
jockeys rode.	1084.1516412174578
The earl of Dublin, no less.	748.7457280107585
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
Alf.	1212.1193297770672
And says J.	592.3640888758189
—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.	1616.8130416826154
—Will you try another, citizen?	1376.8495037818602
—Yes, sir, says he.	535.4313047118326
I will.	592.3640888758189
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
May your shadow never grow less.	1512.1352658891174
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.	784.6746171349943
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling
about.	1442.8015760078058
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	968.7230747512339
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	1376.8650244983396
—But do you know what a nation means?	888.4180878747509
says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, says Bloom.	592.3640888758189
—What is it?	338.4313499265509
says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
A nation is the same people living in the same
place.	1062.0035683460237
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m
living in the same place for the past five years.	971.5162711751736
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to
muck out of it:
	1037.0514424295743
—Or also living in different places.	1250.4172685081778
—That covers my case, says Joe.	946.4336915828393
—What is your nation if I may ask?	1003.5136543574038
I was born here.	1196.2887651162587
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
swab himself dry.	1229.3144143894126
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	946.4356385157885
Take that in your right hand and
repeat after me the following words.	1734.1284606795464
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,
authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and
called forth prolonged admiration.	1030.593835880847
No need to dwell on the legendary
beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly
discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the
four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American
puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said
in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	1633.1011765038822
The
scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and
raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive
stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as
when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy
long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	1776.2835352210375
Glendalough, the lovely
lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh
and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh
Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company
(Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the
Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of
Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at
Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,
Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.	707.5839421309796
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,
Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,
the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,
Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today
rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed
over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	1205.9977403919931
—Show us over the drink, says I.	1081.865980725496
Which is which?	946.4336915828404
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	1095.8933461945314
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	1322.55284661567
Also now.	592.3640888758189
This very moment.	737.2909362695849
This very instant.	946.4336915828404
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	1682.1847236455815
—Robbed, says he.	324.0231264178809
Taking what belongs
to us by right.	1616.7919550302338
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	1604.4068025063368
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	828.0524805018343
—Right, says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
Stand up to it then with force like men.	1626.580756367344
That’s an almanac picture for you.	1115.154593776858
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	1376.6289974109577
Old
lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	1109.3221027996892
Gob, he’d adorn a
sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him.	1539.9918040363743
And
then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
limp as a wet rag.	1602.7717174736338
—But it’s no use, says he.	1021.3902727193666
Force, hatred, history, all that.	1040.5803731468309
That’s not
life for men and women, insult and hatred.	1747.826112324653
And everybody knows that
it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.	1520.005052796843
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—Love, says Bloom.	592.3640888758189
I mean the opposite of hatred.	1512.0997541085937
I must go now, says
he to John Wyse.	1018.1108459905078
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
there.	849.5547746472458
If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second.	973.7521923783107
Just a moment.	461.547359392372
Who’s hindering you?	1196.3022706333559
And off he pops like greased lightning.	1616.8228055439354
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	795.7192102916367
Universal love.	592.3640888758189
—Well, says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
Isn’t that what we’re told.	1616.7537448626708
Love your neighbour.	946.4336915828404
—That chap?	592.3640888758189
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	1334.595613212323
Love,
moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	946.3607623160115
Love loves to love love.	1376.8495037818602
Nurse loves the new chemist.	1376.7777889616134
Constable 14A
loves Mary Kelly.	592.3640888758189
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	1391.3040787238072
loves a fair gentleman.	2415.9067065924705
Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	692.5044133719111
Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant.	885.149860352046
Old Mr Verschoyle with
the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	1141.0463166175903
The man
in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	1023.1270412617156
His Majesty the King
loves Her Majesty the Queen.	592.3640888758189
Mrs Norman W.	592.3640888758189
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	592.3640888758189
You love a certain person.	1376.7729021706718
And this person loves that other person
because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	1512.122098760391
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	1196.2858529246162
More power,
citizen.	946.4336915828404
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.	481.3418831447566
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	1823.5817629588034
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	1871.1651963503575
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_
pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	1302.4622771181423
The bible! Did you read that skit
in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting
England?	933.2960433666772
—What’s that?	461.5357045536777
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
reading out:
	1387.5107421896746
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of
which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely
translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod
Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the
cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,
stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an
illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of
England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief
woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the
august hand of the Royal Donor.	1245.2937842484473
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of
firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty
Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and
signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a
charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed
several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	1482.047020101486
—Widow woman, says Ned.	592.3640888758189
I wouldn’t doubt her.	1376.833745184088
Wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as I would.	1406.5462793746642
—Same only more so, says Lenehan.	946.4342703960759
And thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	1870.970863407533
—Is that by Griffith?	592.3640888758189
says John Wyse.	592.3640888758189
—No, says the citizen.	239.63767426763113
It’s not signed Shanganagh.	784.6268743505209
It’s only
initialled: P.	784.6657718872434
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.	1089.3180326868212
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen.	865.1873889952452
Trade follows the flag.	1196.2949399367567
—Well, says J.	592.3640888758189
J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the
Congo Free State they must be bad.	1023.5995976765978
Did you read that report by a man
what’s this his name is?	1202.2335139623106
—Casement, says the citizen.	239.63767426763113
He’s an Irishman.	592.3640888758189
—Yes, that’s the man, says J.	509.9827630233493
Raping the women and girls and
flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they
can out of them.	1536.6626055555455
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	747.5243482311103
says I.	592.3640888758189
—Bloom, says he.	324.0231264178809
The courthouse is a blind.	1185.1039523510954
He had a few bob on
_Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.	1069.7678483995917
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	1376.8311119807868
says the citizen, that never backed a
horse in anger in his life?	1243.4904970572227
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan.	750.8651031266874
I met Bantam Lyons going to back
that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	919.9475733082403
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	1122.0894681658917
He’s the
only man in Dublin has it.	737.6949963111784
A dark horse.	946.4114650810416
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	1107.0331338331423
—Mind, Joe, says I.	592.3640888758189
Show us the entrance out.	1376.849375824736
—There you are, says Terry.	675.4910190596232
Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort.	564.313429780123
So I just went round the back of the
yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s
better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool
if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)
Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody
(there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	1424.2652461630057
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
about selling Irish industries.	1207.3565927700126
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	592.3640888758189
Gob, that
puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	1885.7515091907485
Give us a bloody chance.	1376.7545121237065
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
mouseabout.	1139.4581335697262
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	1196.0030963955955
And his old fellow before
him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	1713.4393954466364
Loans by post on easy terms.	1334.6465833440009
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	1767.7210214372626
Distance no object.	946.4292464214541
No
security.	592.3640888758189
Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the
road with every one.	1303.3258675019333
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse.	587.7962312737952
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the
collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
country at the king’s expense.	1149.2778262366114
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
palfreys.	1871.024754909063
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	1671.5419932904729
Saucy knave! To us!
	592.3640888758189
So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	1911.015162837166
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	1795.268762518116
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	1686.9017896306113
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	1409.6705561344256
Look to our steeds.	1196.2643416246938
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	1837.0670471363358
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
larder.	1873.3488503642886
I know not what to offer your lordships.	1548.0826554727767
—How now, fellow?	946.4336915828404
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?	1189.3555650699132
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.	1700.0716633982302
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	1617.3112672987277
An you be the king’s
messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	1056.1085831926603
The
king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
house I warrant me.	960.4564911527888
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
trencherman by his aspect.	1905.3693461678497
Hast aught to give us?	1185.309166216738
Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
	1409.6234695637208
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s
head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a
flagon of old Rhenish?	2090.0869333133096
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	1376.7927934215193
That likes me well.	991.975450508825
—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	1452.0701230534783
A poor house and a bare
larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.	1263.38566325555
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	706.1578209475638
—Where is he?	416.2664053616629
says Lenehan.	592.3640888758189
Defrauding widows and orphans.	1196.3022706333559
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	739.6896681689667
—That’s so, says Martin.	784.6613490310291
Or so they allege.	1196.279180360219
—Who made those allegations?	1196.3022706333559
says Alf.	592.3640888758189
—I, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
I’m the alligator.	1196.272770789106
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like
the next fellow?	1450.3998687406806
says J.	592.3640888758189
J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.	1066.9150612842375
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
hell is he?	1447.5105948510554
says Ned.	592.3640888758189
Or who is he?	455.3094992058403
No offence, Crofton.	592.3640888758189
—Who is Junius?	592.3640888758189
says J.	592.3640888758189
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	952.152207620476
We know
that in the castle.	880.9381559840962
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	1018.0421451504981
says Jack Power.	592.3640888758189
—Not at all, says Martin.	784.6811811377031
Only namesakes.	592.3640888758189
His name was Virag, the
father’s name that poisoned himself.	1039.5745121270354
He changed it by deedpoll, the
father did.	1700.078204994688
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	474.67738177510194
Island of saints
and sages!
	1376.8533842206493
—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	1228.435557478137
For that
matter so are we.	1250.417814209071
J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their
Messiah.	1367.857634882221
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	1293.4251602860193
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
that died was born.	993.446070192988
I met him one day in the south city markets buying
a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	1376.2453507361747
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J.	946.4336915828393
—Do you call that a man?	847.8166743747878
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	973.2869372381366
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	1109.9343418791264
—And who does he suspect?	1376.830101988472
Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest.	1034.8153301179652
One of those mixed
middlings he is.	1129.108576806474
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
month with headache like a totty with her courses.	1194.289950812121
Do you know what I’m
telling you?	586.1705943022117
It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	1177.43075221693
Justifiable homicide, so it
would.	872.6500340599945
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
stuff like a man.	1463.5325360095142
Give us your blessing.	1196.2938425462191
Not as much as would blind
your eye.	1071.2402835139244
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	945.8963941835198
But where is he?	393.9755327965777
We can’t wait.	1196.243224049451
That’s what he is.	832.9662603076147
Virag
from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	615.2570036185964
Cursed by God.	592.3640888758189
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	991.8516966590033
says Ned.	592.3640888758189
—Only one, says Martin.	592.3640888758189
We must be quick.	1196.1691130066206
and S.	592.3640888758189
Three half ones, Terry.	592.3640888758189
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
shores.	1323.744366611234
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	919.3071017892773
God bless all here is my
prayer.	1616.7804945806408
—Amen, says the citizen.	239.63767426763113
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.	592.3640888758189
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and
Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
of S.	1176.7274090892693

christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice.	1146.8365903528766

And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the
reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	982.1024400585704
And when the
good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard
Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale
grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine
and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the
house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults
and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and
the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the
lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that
house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	1470.6962881668871
And entering he
blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed
answered his prayers.	1528.2983969791082

	748.7545201171381

	1496.1206889455761
—And so say all of us, says Jack.	1004.2584734234542
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	592.3640888758189
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	643.0333552741203
And butter for fish.	1196.3022706333559
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike
when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a
hurry.	1498.489045542009
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	1314.72209075227
I hope
I’m not...	624.666155982644
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.	946.4081758189664
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	1580.5045225017507
Mean bloody scut.	946.4336915828404
Stand us a drink itself.	1376.7932004143004
Devil a sweet fear! There’s
a jew for you! All for number one.	871.4201079628215
Cute as a shithouse rat.	1376.5484019026956
Hundred to
five.	737.2840105113547
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.	467.9552380095341
—Beg your pardon, says he.	723.7363900344012
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	1196.376452287184
Come along now.	946.4336915828404
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	783.3268907483409
It’s a
secret.	1196.078329097278
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	1692.131949441361
—Bye bye all, says Martin.	784.6746171349943
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be
all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	1167.3075405474162
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	831.7621851684914
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off
forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	2072.693387286242
A many comely
nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the
sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the
cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds
them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas
they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	2121.161768608954
Even so
did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	1873.4038228981806
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark
clave the waves.	1669.9407761880273
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little
Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	1332.1849910326182
—Let me alone, says he.	723.7363900344012
—Three cheers for Israel!
	592.3640888758189
Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake
and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	1264.5463017710235
Jesus, there’s
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
bloody nothing.	1914.8518770285038
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
would.	1632.9969238335893
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and
Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews
and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him
to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a
patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,
jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:
	1282.9746864881292
—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
	1082.011111806425
And says he:
	324.0231264178809
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	563.0598236959878
And
the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	792.763772250464
Your God.	592.3640888758189
—He had no father, says Martin.	946.4159101137042
That’ll do now.	1196.2780832210783
Drive ahead.	592.3640888758189
—Whose God?	592.3640888758189
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	860.7444203942636
Your God was a jew.	502.9876967687803
Christ was a
jew like me.	1042.839718635459
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	1456.6315093950668
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
name.	1376.8395462210594
By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will.	809.5723909493604
Give us that biscuitbox here.	1376.853384062898
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.	592.3640888758189
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for
the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of
Murmuring Waters).	1094.632184612084
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	2002.6713156064413
An illuminated scroll
of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	1518.6386369673896
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of
Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,
followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.	1410.9115250327861
Tarbarrels and bonfires
were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the
Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains
of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of
M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	834.8590140397652
Amid
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a
big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,
the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and
Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	1680.8579127208477
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not
forgotten.	809.5603756041401
Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s
royal theatre:
	1302.8543046988814
—Where is he till I murder him?	885.165395925893
And Ned and J.	592.3640888758189
paralysed with the laughing.	1505.260179799625
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.	924.4857379834045
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other
way and off with him.	1307.2484309023184
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	784.6746171349943
Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	1335.8784435355856
Mercy of God the
sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.	1114.9529213072167
Gob, he near sent
it into the county Longford.	1038.077623731872
The bloody nag took fright and the old
mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting
and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	1565.7663173348396
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	1767.7302877448858
The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the
fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a
similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,
the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	1347.0100002847928
The epicentre appears to
have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay
ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,
two roods and one square pole or perch.	1311.435213851415
All the lordly residences in
the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble
edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal
debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it
is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	1687.9009152800945
From the
reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were
accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character.	2038.9782463365163
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the
much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a
silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat
of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of
quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been
discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island
respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s
causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in
the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	1619.2722592320793
Other
eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of
enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying
velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	2176.717012683197
Messages of
condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the
different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously
pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be
celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority
of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who
have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	1911.2197853272246
The work of
salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to
Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	1106.4157715836734
and C.	592.3640888758189

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff.	1223.5416011428686
The jarvey saved his life by
furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	1188.4078281363945
O, Jesus, he did.	565.2942152908782
And
he let a volley of oaths after him.	1480.9942743482545
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?	1013.4887875037605
And he shouting to the bloody dog:
	1304.6212232090438
—After him, Garry! After him, boy!
	748.7545201171381
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
you.	682.5543985637731
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	1524.5724963058176
And they beheld Him in
the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having
raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they
durst not look upon Him.	1555.4726305695403
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:
_Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And
they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels
ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	1089.767894915898
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace.	1946.1524919113194
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a
beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	1635.2828686286025
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	1868.6889716418866
Many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name _H.	1486.077366164188
Belleisle_ printed on both.	1196.2822976487903
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	1731.1272460756793
They
were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building
castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy
as the day was long.	2029.242213598325
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight.	1443.6280550314748
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a
tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	1964.7982856636377
Cissy
Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty
dimple in his chin.	1641.821225457539
Say out big, big.	1196.2980565823646
I want a drink of
water.	1334.5868339868975
And baby prattled after her:
	1096.0912011179105
—A jink a jink a jawbo.	1334.6426328590724
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of
children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could
never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that
held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown
bread with golden syrup on.	1656.8625109830361
What a persuasive power that girl had! But
to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in
his new fancy bib.	1266.5583978023085
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,
was Cissy Caffrey.	764.8350840210966
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	1855.2133745201845
And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	1374.94538020146
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
Master Jacky.	747.9114619512367
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to
this golden rule.	1905.3922889315475
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like
the Martello tower had.	1239.6426132716642
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky
was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s
house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose
that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too.	1648.1778478790693
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master
Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	1083.243867956452
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	1082.0138570386182
At once! And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	1039.5565450813262
Wait till I
catch you for that.	675.7972330240694
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister’s word was law with the twins.	1674.0081608526448
And in a sad plight he
was too after his misadventure.	1618.5360143571268
His little man-o’-war top and
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	1782.8230317057887
Still the blue
eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed
away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and
said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing
in admonition.	1823.4725770041266
—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	553.4640033477888
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
	1747.8120404426168
—What’s your name?	991.9020637280948
Butter and cream?	647.1903747676978
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	1106.417810430061
Is Cissy your
sweetheart?	698.0336383257707
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.	592.3640888758189
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	675.4898473128194
Cissy queried.	592.3640888758189
—Nao, Tommy said.	592.3640888758189
—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
her shortsighted eyes.	1557.0019902250626
Gerty is
Tommy’s sweetheart.	675.4898473128194
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	976.3575575977385
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.	1604.624256220091
But who was Gerty?	592.3640888758189
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	1732.0171820980358
She was
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,
she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	1417.538644478551
The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth
was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.	1413.6889088751293
Her hands were of finely
veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and
queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used
to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	1887.1314819276656
Bertha Supple
told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black
out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their
little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or
she’d never speak to her again.	1522.1808352479493
Honour where honour is due.	1376.861144421135
There
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	1696.4061117452318
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their
devoirs to her.	1799.50921096242
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	1616.8114821919085
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and
dark expressive brows.	1528.6603022482245
Time was when those brows were not so silkily
seductive.	1823.8097692532172
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	1472.9557085431786
Then
there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase
your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	1832.2356807453195
That would
suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	853.3831328474437
But Gerty’s crowning
glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	1646.5849448709355
It was dark brown with a
natural wave in it.	1432.4540138092502
She had cut it that very morning on account of the
new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	1487.3997993759638
And
just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet
girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not
hold her equal.	1615.159646598315
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	1870.9925066818623
She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	1782.56587812993
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	1502.6821397418637
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young
May morning.	1684.8780683060734
She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
lovers’ quarrel.	1643.7566209717234
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about
the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding
up and down in front of her window.	1322.901770306716
Only now his father kept him in in
the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate
that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a
doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	1419.1087064719707
Wylie who
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	1345.195648736421
Little
recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart
sometimes, piercing to the core.	1848.3780137216147
Yet he was young and perchance he
might learn to love her in time.	1606.8582177154444
They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	874.7719842035774
But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the
bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice
perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front
of her bit of a garden.	1521.3090245066621
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
out.	1256.175528500228
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because
it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be
worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful
figure to perfection.	1916.6216775676717
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	1941.2554879114753
All Tuesday
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she
found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	1793.4300292487994
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to
her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew
that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	1793.5341621077932
Her shoes
were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she
was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a
five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle over her higharched instep.	1589.612067353225
Her wellturned ankle displayed
its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount
and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with
highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	1898.2366889460184
As for undies they were Gerty’s
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet
seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in
his heart to blame her?	1567.1283961769884
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty
stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,
and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the
wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because
she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching
the things.	1901.9815387931953
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her
own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and
because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside
out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things
on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so
long as it wasn’t of a Friday.	1805.313545145331
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time.	802.1472762050438
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror.	1532.6033511613082
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	748.7474864952692
The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	1946.0908163128497
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	827.4670428223698
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	1522.8710062505024
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs
Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
was not to be.	1294.6279652946898
He was too young to understand.	1512.0606872107726
He would not believe in
love, a woman’s birthright.	1482.470365381264
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	1557.9793439739904
He called her
little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
the room with a remark about refreshments.	1543.2193185121375
Impetuous fellow! Strength
of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would
woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	1156.3551825774061
But waiting,
always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be
over.	1440.7951128757727
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort
her with a long long kiss.	1960.879295278755
It would be like heaven.	1185.2352157254747
For such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.	1823.794818256511
With all the heart of her she longs to be
his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in
health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	1984.6067769773078
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be.	1390.5643684044537
Then they could talk about her till they went blue
in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she
would be twentytwo in November.	1198.0125565808505
She would care for him with creature
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked
that feeling of hominess.	1742.543600362999
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue
and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same
direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of
eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people
that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something
poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully
appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph
of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was
so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in
Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	1811.8864670346516
He would be
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	2123.292532724353
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then
she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	1447.236295346561
But Tommy
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with
the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said
it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please.	1280.3924604647518
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	874.6574506310734
Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	1114.3297790793881
—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	1003.5096007977137
It’s my ball.	1196.2665368305422
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	1481.7722620377674
—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	1081.872087777959
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played
here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
chin.	1903.844349244237
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.	1840.2544622077785
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t
say.	880.5866926830696
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	748.7545201171381
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	1410.6745744170976
But not a pin cared
Ciss.	946.360212518601
—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose.	1598.3990790609223
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
him.	854.6916272853862
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	1196.1582204470026
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	1054.2933612972977
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea
and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on
her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to
go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the
Miss White.	1647.825496091221
That was just like Cissycums.	624.6635122997945
O, and will you ever forget
her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the
burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a
cigarette.	1685.1398890025894
There was none to come up to her for fun.	1100.9589072598756
But she was
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	1789.463780586394
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ.	1653.7237065620984
It was the men’s temperance retreat
conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	1306.3839018126882
J., rosary,
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	1039.4186047713413
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided
the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders
the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in
her carriage, second to none.	1541.302788004627
Over and over had she told herself that
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	1871.594931918406
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had
cast its shadow over her childhood days.	2099.10957917408
Nay, she had even witnessed in
the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen
her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself
completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it
was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	1613.5493294831722
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful.	1141.5283464176184
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	1494.8554150895116
You never saw him
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	1475.8701218823778
Poor
father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper
and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died
suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	1191.0835903044642
Her
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken.	1147.7818905968793
No-one would have thought the end was so near.	1692.2514214227244
Now
he was laid to rest.	1250.5461188056345
And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.	1394.4568385235682
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
gold.	1460.8818495220821
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t
like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	1525.9552961477532
Everyone thought the
world of her for her gentle ways.	1692.0291786420498
It was Gerty who turned off the gas
at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of
that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime
Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	1583.2291669824874
You could see there was a
story behind it.	1069.8878207581747
The colours were done something lovely.	1512.138816961438
She was in a
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	1868.3964626638794
She often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.	1753.7409777451687
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till
at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no
getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	1685.5620221675451
Needless to say poor Tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball.	1908.440566605243
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries
and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it
to her please.	1484.2236703679064
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the
rock.	1619.674570809854
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it
away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she
wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a
kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	1486.6673475468265
—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	841.8114424048898
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	1616.8260600451579
A delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball
a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it
down towards the shingle.	1964.9096765101226
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	1084.023626157947
She
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,
surging and flaming into her cheeks.	1450.4703863115792
Till then they had only exchanged
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had
ever seen.	1888.313640222614
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	1660.1938889552114
And
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,
the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in
any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever
abandoned by her.	1619.643859064114
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	1925.4829151196523
Cissy Caffrey played with
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	1327.9969509669054
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was
Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my
word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say
papa.	1364.9480004999134
—Say papa, baby.	946.4336915828404
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	571.1259838403845
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
to be something great, they said.	1658.1287810004717
—Haja ja ja haja.	1196.3022706333559
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
blanket the other way under him.	1726.369592170615
Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
	1860.6056010307564
—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	946.4336915828404
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	1747.8588507186348
It was all
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen
was quickly appeased.	1744.4662713691885
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins.	1573.2673051440547
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	1373.656501787098
It was like the
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,
the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and
to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they
burned in the church like a kind of waft.	1442.2240300761823
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning
in his look.	1204.9681863007452
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her
through and through, read her very soul.	1784.7902730329452
Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	1870.9479988354733
People were so queer.	1196.272770789106
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face
that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin
Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred
because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they
two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see
whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he
was sitting.	1528.4760479400431
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story
of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	1256.099632202213
She would have given
worlds to know what it was.	1040.5164947170747
He was looking up so intently, so still,
and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the
toes down.	1824.3633489738465
She was glad that something told her to put on the
transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was
far away.	1282.6922572280762
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	1364.8564280922003
It was he
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.	1621.6363245967825
The very
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she
knew on the instant it was him.	1512.3274879554062
If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
man, she cared not.	1588.639254220183
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could
convert him easily if he truly loved her.	1554.4078828784964
There were wounds that wanted
healing with heartbalm.	1700.0678893036218
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the
past.	1795.2739097165124
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for
herself alone.	1850.5783687463636
Refuge of sinners.	946.4336915828404
Comfortress of the afflicted.	1195.3570270365067
_Ora pro nobis_.	946.4292464214541
Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her
own heart.	2078.739276412741
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
cast down.	1344.6096294855158
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet
and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come
to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	1749.7617298512923
He told her that time
when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots
of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was
only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he
said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the
nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady
herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to
Thy Word.	1314.1067726569058
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and
thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or
some place.	1726.5311752939833
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	1471.4509310072278
Little
monkeys common as ditchwater.	1376.861144421135
Someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them.	1486.3724089508917
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	1546.2508839883121
—Jacky! Tommy!
	592.3640888758189
Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
last time she’d ever bring them out.	1020.6493761354498
She jumped up and called them and
she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow
long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat
at it.	1841.4509721292434
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible.	1270.3618602548847
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up
over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French
heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	1701.4666966921045
_Tableau!_
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness.	1191.597801191656
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy
handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and
censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and
she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she
didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a
bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking
that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed
the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the
Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she
just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	1325.5138035701757
Three and eleven she paid for those
stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was
looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
head to see the difference for himself.	1355.0508495075692
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought
only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her
petticoat hanging like a caricature.	1816.7307083509768
Gerty just took off her hat for a
moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown
tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	1687.6426470504136
You would have to travel
many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	1442.0370745398943
She
could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes
that set her tingling in every nerve.	1808.667577382251
She put on her hat so that she
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster
for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	1603.254585743678
He was
eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	1692.0135719831967
Her woman’s instinct told her that
she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a
glorious rose.	1835.9643624121197
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby.	1442.093188567257
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no
concern of hers.	1638.8818536114572
And she said to Gerty:
	675.5611633964406
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	1449.1149149732692
I
was only wondering was it late.	1616.7884876674084
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late.	1762.890311120928
And when Cissy came up Edy
asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was
half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	1272.9845861529764
But Edy wanted to know
because they were told to be in early.	1224.7315263030264
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the
time by his conundrum.	1080.4479757910424
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.	1472.308678674016
Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	1079.5362826895926
One moment
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	1869.4325432245582
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set.	1478.603733965611
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	1777.1763562695705
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
his waterworks were out of order.	1772.2615755787153
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon
got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he
told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and
she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the
works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	1192.2716005005293
It was getting
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it
back and put his hands back into his pockets.	1216.329188525718
She felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.	1421.7013554057594
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her
every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	1901.3849843668556
If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to
be seen on that man’s face.	1303.1625676373087
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you
know it.	860.4673722887114
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	1331.53659538575
Gerty winced sharply.	946.4336915828404
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn
immeasurable.	1873.361123124393
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was.	1525.0546404005404
She had loved him better than he knew.	1283.6590229815313
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle
like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and
for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	1479.7636723924268
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them
to see.	1752.5998515387662
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
flashed up.	1479.4554729667918
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.	1348.0655904043256
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	2083.2739524206395
There was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	1501.3190938293312
As
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a
dozen pieces.	1629.2398472456762
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him
one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	1711.2219729227993
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	1806.5773813113958
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	1107.7325691881567
And Cissy told
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	1792.029474662354
—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	592.3640888758189
He has his bib destroyed.	1376.8417430159382
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
that little matter to rights.	1959.4052969626116
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	1414.9405691860802
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time
a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
thither, with a tiny lost cry.	1597.1261089589534
And she could see far away the lights of
the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church
grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked
and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn
his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss
Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	1498.4179544340564
For Gerty had her
dreams that no-one knew of.	1364.1498855801394
She loved to read poetry and when she got a
keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the
coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of
her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was
scrupulously neat and clean.	1711.9023377538074
It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs.	1778.9175027636493
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J
Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt
thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the
years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	1721.940642109385
But it must end, she felt.	1334.687452822389
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
would be no holding back for her.	1369.9765839346146
Love laughs at locksmiths.	1196.3022706333559
She would
make the great sacrifice.	1512.0250530229778
Her every effort would be to share his
thoughts.	1557.4048810718689
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
days with happiness.	1651.839834298799
There was the allimportant question and she was
dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	1752.896872339232
But
even if—what then?	1096.1020766741285
Would it make a very great difference?	1305.1645808317712
From
everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
recoiled.	1460.3851501224924
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and
being taken up to the police station.	1682.0892738899604
No, no: not that.	1196.279056084112
They would be
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	1575.2675822200495
She
thought she understood.	1196.286511752242
She would try to understand him because men
were so different.	1871.0222829056347
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	2026.630724354403
Heart of mine! She would
follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
the master guide.	1414.9895630865622
Nothing else mattered.	946.4336915828404
Come what might she would be
wild, untrammelled, free.	1626.5196619661667
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked
wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
	1183.327905845273
—O, look, Cissy!
	592.3640888758189
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	1769.8897140073004
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	592.3640888758189
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.	1149.2739876882094
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	592.3640888758189
It’s the bazaar fireworks.	1376.6859811978763
But Gerty was adamant.	841.8114424048898
She had no intention of being at their beck and
call.	1870.9924479114522
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she
could see from where she was.	1564.7116983037145
The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling.	1871.0301765656975
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her.	1933.6368321604348
Whitehot passion was in that face,
passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	1652.1297357916455
At last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.	1986.630201722163
His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her.	1795.3698645429936
But this was altogether different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips.	1748.435746591231
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on
the way it did.	1499.5961250604844
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	1446.5131896205005
And
she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so
immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	1844.0341606616425
She
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry
that has rung through the ages.	1989.3117776603083
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot
blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh
of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a
stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,
soft!
	1334.3328093731802
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	1738.3850770082556
Ah! She
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	1842.9320714852784
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	1699.969778679854
Leopold Bloom (for it is
he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	1771.3524925012607
What a brute he had been! At it again?	730.1905012266952
A fair unsullied soul had called
to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	1320.4866936372591
An utter cad he
had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in
those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and
sinned and wandered.	1450.4158232093155
Should a girl tell?	1196.2709857756745
No, a thousand times no.	1376.8417430159382
That
was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there
was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly
through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.	1660.5189690085228
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:
	1634.23771721872
—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going.	784.6729817541723
Come on.	592.3640888758189
We can see from farther up.	1512.1016039928372
Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.	1692.374762226362
She slipped a hand into
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
course without letting him and then slipped it back.	1792.9529280963081
Wonder if he’s too
far to.	1305.3721145636207
She rose.	592.3640888758189
Was it goodbye?	946.4336915828404
She had to go but they would meet
again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
dream of yester eve.	1829.5420678466674
She drew herself up to her full height.	1427.1175586907696
Their
souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her
heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet
flowerlike face.	1926.6255540573875
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,
a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	1909.8562142947458
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	958.066362962822
It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
slippy seaweed.	1746.308085918576
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell
was...	1399.2922121150784
Tight boots?	592.3640888758189
She’s lame! O!
	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	1197.1270943918723
Poor girl! That’s why she’s
left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	1329.3447224280978
Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib.	1400.4417810721966
Jilted beauty.	592.3640888758189
A defect is ten times worse
in a woman.	1320.8442429660222
But makes them polite.	1196.3010339675943
Glad I didn’t know it when she was
on show.	937.7973442752947
Hot little devil all the same.	653.3568798206136
I wouldn’t mind.	991.9463714300542
Curiosity like
a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	1686.5709254282342
That squinty one is
delicate.	1376.8311119807886
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	974.7679358797832
I
have such a bad headache today.	991.7893264443497
Where did I put the letter?	782.5869521765536
Yes, all
right.	392.53412403905105
All kinds of crazy longings.	1376.8301013573916
Licking pennies.	592.3640888758189
Girl in Tranquilla
convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	1479.8316761829888
Virgins go mad in the
end I suppose.	842.6449822050758
Martha,
she.	592.3640888758189
Something in the air.	314.29474083712154
That’s the moon.	729.3496506815596
But then why don’t all
women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	1053.3260195229132
Depends
on the time they were born I suppose.	1017.8552033920026
Or all start scratch then get out
of step.	1456.7305227848124
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	592.3640888758189
Anyhow I got the best of
that.	715.1041670514378
Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her
silly I will punish you letter.	985.8014338707707
Made up for that tramdriver this
morning.	1164.8289494127912
That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing.	793.4216675029285
And his wife
engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	1701.022000621573
Thankful for
small mercies.	1196.3022706333559
Cheap too.	592.3640888758189
Yours for the asking.	991.533935145716
Because they want it
themselves.	1185.258848050834
Their natural craving.	946.4336915828404
Shoals of them every evening poured
out of offices.	1768.4399241088697
Reserve better.	592.3640888758189
Don’t want it they throw it at you.	1318.5447196768057
Catch em alive, O.	592.3640888758189
Pity they can’t see themselves.	781.8474596124536
A dream of
wellfilled hose.	1376.8417430159382
Where was that?	593.4643785573064
Mutoscope pictures in Capel
street: for men only.	1003.5158825385695
Peeping Tom.	592.3640888758189
Willy’s hat and what the girls did
with it.	1442.970784525941
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	1578.367577943251
_Lingerie_
does it.	528.9560683471097
Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also
when they’re.	1313.7464723495495
I’m all clean come and dirty me.	1700.0447131113742
And they like dressing
one another for the sacrifice.	1376.8297247310848
Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.	885.1498603158275
At first.	592.3640888758189
Put them all on to take them all off.	1496.6135794306706
Why I bought her
the violet garters.	1322.6205641087206
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and
turnedup trousers.	1795.6651059768326
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we
met.	1563.2835186512573
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	1700.0648949413728
of jet.	2416.4139386531347
Say a woman
loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	1911.3496787752622
Pinned together.	592.3640888758189
O, Mairy
lost the pin of her.	568.8870711772311
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	1096.6336626727461
Fashion part
of their charm.	1376.7075434994993
Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.	1168.0206224764806
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	841.809959736356
No reasonable offer
refused.	1196.3022706333559
She wasn’t in a hurry either.	1188.964674853578
Always off to a fellow when they
are.	1115.3791790306927
They never forget an appointment.	1376.845623748392
Out on spec probably.	1196.3022706333559
They
believe in chance because like themselves.	1616.8147369005221
And the others inclined to
give her an odd dig.	1823.7891156037192
Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s
necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about
nothing in the convent garden.	1970.90889192036
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs
and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they
can’t get.	1571.1058098399315
Barbed wire.	592.3640888758189
Be sure now and write to me.	1086.7618376360729
And I’ll write to
you.	739.5375129948235
Now won’t you?	489.9062049064153
Molly and Josie Powell.	592.3640888758189
Till Mr Right comes along,
then meet once in a blue moon.	1072.597533801166
_Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the
love of God! How are you at all?	800.1829071825631
What have you been doing with
yourself?	1616.8175576125489
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	1120.1422250248625
Picking holes in
each other’s appearance.	1373.747170719484
You’re looking splendid.	822.5531718577369
Sister souls.	592.3640888758189
Showing
their teeth at one another.	948.2700046257127
How many have you left?	1185.2702733076749
Wouldn’t lend each
other a pinch of salt.	1432.9991430683997
Devils they are when that’s coming on them.	1557.5247331803803
Dark devilish appearance.	946.4336915828404
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	1767.7386751852625
Scratch the sole of my
foot.	1334.5001771887971
O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	869.2281873711546
Good to rest
once in a way.	750.7412797199687
Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then.	1279.1049918014098
Safe in one
way.	1196.2634215815906
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	1376.8650244983396
Something about withering
plants I read in a garden.	896.679590830392
Besides they say if the flower withers she
wears she’s a flirt.	1659.2582435022432
All are.	592.3640888758189
Daresay she felt I.	592.3640888758189
When you feel like
that you often meet what you feel.	1472.0289733521504
Liked me or what?	899.563906429417
Dress they look
at.	1196.4116631779343
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	1548.0343550617367
Well cocks and
lions do the same and stags.	1432.969054253161
Same time might prefer a tie undone or
something.	1481.0558042080477
Suppose I when I was?	592.3640888758189
Gently does it.	528.9560683471097
Dislike
rough and tumble.	991.9789448889109
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	816.1268156576594
Saw something in me.	1196.267552268195
Wonder what.	592.3640888758189
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with
bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	1668.904409291132
To aid
gentleman in literary.	872.6116578142478
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	1700.0215338416942
Didn’t
let her see me in profile.	1548.0726376738596
Still, you never know.	666.1591090236655
Pretty girls and ugly
men marrying.	1512.1352658891174
Beauty and the beast.	633.4106072943327
Besides I can’t be so if Molly.	913.7750940774307
Wide brim.	592.3640888758189
Bought to hide her face,
meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers
to smell.	1750.275835311234
Hair strong in rut.	1196.2938424605543
Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when
we were on the rocks in Holles street.	756.5257585113199
Why not?	592.3640888758189
Suppose he gave her
money.	1376.838240183588
Why not?	592.3640888758189
All a prejudice.	946.4336915828404
She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a
pound.	1700.0447143605777
I think so.	946.4336915828404
All that for nothing.	843.0394607822354
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	592.3640888758189
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent
to Flynn?	1196.2319089831963
And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie.	869.1258630632234
Wrangle
with Molly it was put me off.	1089.4522818355817
No, I remember.	592.3640888758189
Richie Goulding: he’s
another.	1039.5278870860282
Weighs on his mind.	676.3740012921985
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	1409.6967423767878
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	1452.721703309083
Could do it myself.	745.9371766726377
Was
that just when he, she?	1334.6287785337486
O, he did.	556.5486679744891
Into her.	592.3640888758189
She did.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	1512.134082200199
O Lord, that
little limping devil.	1196.2833357078846
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	1512.1210612500947
Aftereffect not
pleasant.	946.4292464214541
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	1039.9957031661513
They don’t care.	899.9358924934099
Complimented perhaps.	592.3640888758189
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	1975.9505669080638
Well, aren’t they?	822.5423364563657
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	1823.7963292919867
The name too.	737.2909362695849
_Amours_ of actresses.	946.4336915828404
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud
Branscombe.	592.3640888758189
Curtain up.	592.3640888758189
Moonlight silver effulgence.	737.2909362695849
Maiden discovered
with pensive bosom.	1376.8495037818602
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	1334.6121050598895
Still, I feel.	592.3640888758189
The strength it gives a man.	1070.6013393709454
That’s the secret of it.	742.7052337146204
Good job I let
off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s.	992.0636619889028
Cider that was.	507.2284106919343
Otherwise I couldn’t have.	1039.3297875593107
Makes you want to sing after.	1055.9790806853944
_Lacaus esant
taratara_.	946.4336915828404
Suppose I spoke to her.	572.984789865641
What about?	592.3640888758189
Bad plan however if you
don’t know how to end the conversation.	880.7313831714753
Ask them a question they ask
you another.	1700.0079011698224
Good idea if you’re stuck.	1197.5014787815799
Gain time.	592.3640888758189
But then you’re in a
cart.	961.615619616283
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s
on for it: good evening.	1618.786728465907
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I
nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	857.0464353957168
Whew! Girl in Meath
street that night.	752.0932822948537
All the dirty things I made her say.	1003.5030489974416
All wrong of
course.	674.0917838022579
My arks she called it.	872.593163903127
It’s so hard to find one who.	1700.0172829778157
Aho! If
you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they
harden.	1534.756345199827
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	1149.0118445595654
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	1699.3351769137012
Wish she hadn’t
called me sir.	1259.9945151483605
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a
single girl! That’s what they enjoy.	1038.915748042729
Taking a man from another woman.	1512.1930240531117
Or even hear of it.	634.4383135408544
Different with me.	528.9436462520625
Eating off his cold plate.	1376.7901538186848
Chap in the Burton today
spitting back gumchewed gristle.	1106.4284526924087
French letter still in my pocketbook.	1334.5068240230507
Cause of half the trouble.	1185.2531469290004
But might happen sometime, I don’t think.	713.2672244632323
Come in, all is prepared.	1376.873426096993
I dreamt.	592.3640888758189
Worst is beginning.	946.4336915828404
How they
change the venue when it’s not what they like.	1401.1420229365715
Ask you do you like
mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	1782.8485625386948
Or ask you what
someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	1293.7734714325238
Yet if I
went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	822.8136842227156
Because I did.	592.3640888758189
She too.	592.3640888758189
Offend her.	592.3640888758189
Then make it up.	456.4314001525999
Pretend to want something
awfully, then cry off for her sake.	1632.7792634217049
Flatters them.	592.3640888758189
She must have been
thinking of someone else all the time.	918.8020361962458
What harm?	592.3640888758189
Must since she came
to the use of reason, he, he and he.	1345.9224016791475
First kiss does the trick.	895.834407900576
The
propitious moment.	946.4336915828404
Something inside them goes pop.	1376.861144421135
Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly.	1226.3915328100866
First thoughts are best.	1196.3022706333559
Remember that till
their dying day.	1512.1317147529485
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
Moorish wall beside the gardens.	1133.3212958080544
Fifteen she told me.	489.85238224561635
But her breasts
were developed.	1376.8650244983396
Fell asleep then.	946.4292464214541
After Glencree dinner that was when
we drove home.	1391.3759368490482
Featherbed mountain.	592.3640888758189
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	1096.0912014428059
Lord
mayor had his eye on her too.	1699.9289447755807
Val Dillon.	592.3640888758189
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	1387.4133319776743
My fireworks.	592.3640888758189
Up
like a rocket, down like a stick.	1426.7646127298099
And the children, twins they must be,
waiting for something to happen.	1700.7969916854995
Want to be grownups.	1196.174117522858
Dressing in
mother’s clothes.	1376.796184814963
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	704.773225002243
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	1699.9017064044237
I knew she
could whistle.	1376.8165447609144
Mouth made for that.	698.0890869035484
Like Molly.	592.3640888758189
Why that highclass
whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.	1386.130828834191
Would you mind,
please, telling me the right time?	1432.9759969276581
I’ll tell you the right time up a
dark lane.	1240.710992687231
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for
fat lips.	1911.3416220208835
Caressing the little boy too.	1376.7865606788216
Onlookers see most of the game.	989.6987641283469
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	1616.8130418810986
In their line.	737.2943990675084
Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.	1274.0901122328162
Wouldn’t give that
satisfaction.	1376.8542798217993
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	681.7937896283356
Fine eyes she had, clear.	1376.7558482905781
Did she know what I?	784.6724058811368
Like a cat sitting
beyond a dog’s jump.	1626.5436057005784
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high
school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	877.7679489103555
Call
that innocence?	946.4336915828404
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	1169.6389214541296
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	1196.1442410978734
Eyes all over them.	1196.333321369787
Look under the bed for what’s not there.	1432.9756615632782
Longing to get the fright of
their lives.	1044.76450456384
Sharp as needles they are.	946.903213708942
When I said to Molly the man at
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm.	1072.268318644692
Where do they get that?	1185.1896794224383
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings.	1051.8340707653804
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	1196.292545637349
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the
mirror to save the ironing.	1836.895094948254
And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to
Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her
stocking! Clever little minx.	929.5311505095932
I never told her.	1196.2945339531623
Neat way she carries
parcels too.	1512.1281636973065
Attract men, small thing like that.	618.7417113903784
Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	1641.8083698655266
Who did you
learn that from?	1512.0768680701271
Something the nurse taught me.	1376.853384062898
O, don’t they
know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just
before we left Lombard street west.	888.4545294036698
Me have a nice pace.	1376.6778554073599
Who
knows?	592.3640888758189
Young student.	592.3640888758189
Straight on her pins anyway
not like the other.	1151.7923919322202
Still she was game.	1196.2350815329687
Lord, I am wet.	841.8114424048898
Devil you are.	461.5364173455861
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	1512.138816961438
Not like that frump today.	1376.958914650312
Rumpled stockings.	592.3640888758189
Or the one in
Grafton street.	660.8313751377626
Wow! Beef to the heel.	894.1718526254004
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	1767.7688841065128
Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads.	1376.8572643548641
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the
rocks.	931.8457199840149
Will she?	592.3640888758189
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	592.3640888758189
She smelt an onion.	1196.3022706333559
Darling, I saw, your.	841.8114424048898
I saw all.	946.4292464214541
Did me good all the same.	653.3568798206136
Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.	592.3640888758189
For
this relief much thanks.	878.3805381550931
In _Hamlet,_ that is.	500.62645633707945
Lord! It was all things
combined.	1196.255878955873
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of
my tongue.	1510.8769857973778
Your head it simply swirls.	719.6978809299593
He’s right.	593.5165079714973
Might have made a
worse fool of myself however.	1626.5079445559338
Instead of talking about nothing.	1376.836667025168
Then I
will tell you all.	600.7848065361057
It
couldn’t be?	1196.1723495130043
No, Gerty they called her.	1039.4054846382944
Might be false name however
like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.	1417.5783367195102
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
	748.7527617590948
And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	1196.1842456719464
Place made me think of that I suppose.	832.126768016083
All tarred with the same brush.	1333.8923746013745
Wiping pens in their stockings.	1376.609710523434
But the ball rolled down to her as if
it understood.	1400.621158739967
Every bullet has its billet.	1376.861144421135
Course I never could throw
anything straight at school.	1391.3546056095063
Crooked as a ram’s horn.	1511.8490363823485
Sad however
because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby
when they hold him out to do ah ah.	1904.4476065415276
No soft job.	946.4292464214541
Saves them.	592.3640888758189
Keeps them
out of harm’s way.	997.0391344557694
Washing child, washing corpse.	1196.3022706333559
Children’s hands always round them.	1334.6457671107617
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	2026.502198100993
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	1686.9688081569916
Fill it up
with wind.	1185.3589744440442
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	592.3640888758189
Must call to the hospital.	1019.6499409531003
Wonder is
nurse Callan there still.	660.8666080985872
She used to look over some nights when Molly
was in the Coffee Palace.	883.2389255679683
That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her
brushing his coat.	869.5937260313871
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,
marriageable.	987.6503691048144
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City
Arms.	765.1776035972167
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	1370.2357021413927
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	1325.2285899107776
Then ask in
the morning: was I drunk last night?	744.0833154819397
Bad policy however to fault the
husband.	1616.8065321436654
Chickens come home to roost.	1185.263058078924
They stick by one another like
glue.	1616.7884952513562
Maybe the women’s fault also.	1250.3990072968932
That’s where Molly can knock spots
off them.	1106.4267204841644
It’s the blood of the south.	689.8207813080915
Also the form, the
figure.	1376.8543342047462
Hands felt for the opulent.	712.9148056068747
Just compare for instance those
others.	1512.129035556058
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	1626.9945181362386
Allow me to
introduce my.	1376.7617627725758
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,
wouldn’t know what to call her.	1184.7423882728176
Always see a fellow’s weak point in his
wife.	1442.9462456249792
Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love.	1767.9210821960635
Have their own
secrets between them.	1197.4254880998515
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman
didn’t take them in hand.	1540.5600362495938
Then little chits of girls, height of a
shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	1636.5144901409483
As God made them he matched
them.	1322.6418658125551
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	1512.128163769496
Twice nought makes one.	1196.3022706333559
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	1767.7633489244881
Marry in May and repent
in December.	724.1084873131331
Well the foreskin is
not back.	1334.6008579548184
Better detach.	592.3640888758189
Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	1686.152766585752
Long and the
short of it.	897.744407260605
Big he and little she.	1376.838025322811
Very strange about my watch.	1376.8543947173252
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	1376.8495040184946
Wonder is there any magnetic
influence between the person because that was about the time he.	1613.412745033639
Yes, I
suppose, at once.	699.69905133981
Cat’s away, the mice will play.	1616.7870020958876
I remember looking in
Pill lane.	748.7545201171381
Also that now is magnetism.	1376.8301024617833
Back of everything magnetism.	1196.2938424605543
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	1700.0416753260417
That causes movement.	946.4336915828404
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.	1045.7540586488217
Then if one thing
stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	1837.0857337476837
Because it’s all
arranged.	870.1979737221034
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the
stars.	1057.9705944557024
Little piece of steel iron.	1376.8127204642778
When you hold out the fork.	1511.9621209739457
Woman and man that is.	717.101000439043
Fork and steel.	946.4336915828404
Molly, he.	592.3640888758189
Dress up
and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if
you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look
and if you have any guts in you.	1657.5890170349953
Have to let fly.	822.5486946452115
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	1547.9521997407
Shame all put on before third
person.	1616.8080579105247
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	1432.8857293802535
Molly, her underjaw
stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
the horse show.	2003.1112672095926
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	911.318587357427
Fine
voice that fellow had.	1185.2429174212239
How Giuglini began.	592.3640888758189
Smell that I did.	592.3640888758189
Like
flowers.	592.3640888758189
It was too.	946.3670068650457
Came from the turpentine probably in the
paint.	1700.0228873776437
Make their own use of everything.	1512.0491518749377
Same time doing it scraped her
slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.	1286.441058554792
But lots of them can’t kick
the beam, I think.	1149.624580339311
Keep that thing up for hours.	1512.1005619049781
That’s her perfume.	1196.2980565823661
Why she waved her hand.	835.9993915148543
I leave
you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.	1008.89035424777
What is it?	338.4313499265509
Roses, I think.	592.3640888758189
She’d like scent of that
kind.	1616.652014368655
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	1376.8572642759873
Why Molly likes opoponax.	841.8114424048898
Suits her,
with a little jessamine mixed.	1124.150522420089
Her high notes and her low notes.	1616.7023519078505
At the
dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	1424.4886494080713
Heat brought it out.	803.4211629999234
She
was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	1775.379939388436
Good
conductor, is it?	553.1924225468495
Light too.	592.3640888758189
Suppose there’s some connection.	1377.0708111563065
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.	1795.743441311744
Mysterious thing
too.	946.4336915828404
Why did I smell it only now?	1081.9958648790798
Took its time in coming like herself,
slow but sure.	1823.855445171015
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown
across.	1911.4308334837078
Yes, it is.	345.8160364225982
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
morning, smell them leagues off.	1275.2398749964277
Tell you what it is.	547.2758461638495
It’s like a fine
fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as
anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	1510.0479966942235
Clings to everything
she takes off.	1512.1255370635545
Vamp of her stockings.	1195.9874249918885
Warm shoe.	592.3640888758189
Drawers: little
kick, taking them off.	990.2210531303774
Byby till next time.	773.2868893209346
Also the cat likes to sniff
in her shift on the bed.	1295.8562404255088
Know her smell in a thousand.	1334.0897171329048
Bathwater too.	592.3640888758189
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	912.640445549576
Wonder where it is really.	1376.9965721933454
There
or the armpits or under the neck.	1547.8361206547156
Because you get it out of all holes
and corners.	982.2502509729029
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	1481.0534854886855
Bag under their tails.	1196.26855684203
One grain pour off odour for years.	1616.8130416826154
Good evening.	592.3640888758189
How do you sniff?	1196.6933971595977
Very well, thank you.	749.3067527268917
Animals go by that.	1196.2559142331736
Yes now, look at it that
way.	806.7530124157455
We’re the same.	663.7542501441985
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have
their period.	1747.820782931694
Come near.	592.3640888758189
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	1823.7705625547576
Like what?	592.3640888758189
Boof! Please keep off the
grass.	1196.1728970338354
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	1700.0358521394612
What though?	592.3640888758189
Cigary gloves long
John had on his desk the other day.	1003.2301794146282
Mansmell, I mean.	592.3640888758189
Must be connected with that because
priests that are supposed to be are different.	1694.4281954983262
Women buzz round it like
flies round treacle.	1700.0511599031229
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	1747.7657048205328
The
tree of forbidden priest.	1376.861144421135
O, father, will you?	674.0058675101687
Let me be the first to.	958.7377254546349
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	1699.7991030075964
Source of life.	423.53599958878664
And it’s extremely curious the smell.	1617.0354301818782
Celery sauce.	592.3640888758189
Let me.	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	755.850543579097
Into the.	592.3640888758189
Opening of his waistcoat.	745.600018998061
Almonds or.	592.3640888758189
Lemons it is.	345.8160364225982
Ah no, that’s the soap.	677.9463083676111
O by the by that lotion.	1023.0942658031042
I knew there was something on my mind.	982.896707916962
Never
went back and the soap not paid.	1547.3856570178036
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	1548.038975155019
I could
mention Meagher’s just to remind him.	1018.0453807910081
Still if he works that paragraph.	1512.1475302719261
Two and nine.	556.580376554311
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.	1616.76242500108
Call tomorrow.	592.3640888758189
How much do
I owe you?	748.7545201171381
Three and nine?	556.580376554311
Two and nine, sir.	1196.3140492967987
Might stop him giving
credit another time.	1373.7880229350685
Lose your customers that way.	881.7680323988216
Pubs do.	592.3640888758189
Fellows run
up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into
somewhere else.	1982.126545161691
Here’s this nobleman passed before.	1512.117509569745
Blown in from the bay.	770.8126291322426
Just went as
far as turn back.	1037.5749349007754
Always at home at dinnertime.	1376.8587495759566
Looks mangled out: had
a good tuck in.	1327.3646416061426
Enjoying nature now.	946.4336915828404
Grace after meals.	647.1873352442567
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government
sit.	1496.321214298153
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	1795.5978397184438
Still you learn something.	1196.2938424605543
See ourselves as others see us.	917.6780696553967
So long as
women don’t mock what matter?	1626.8641615892407
Ask yourself
who is he now.	818.8483349955483
_The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr
Leopold Bloom.	735.3795290265577
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.	783.0269068494478
And that
fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	1393.3596990093613
Corns on his
kismet however.	1376.7408480800557
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	1185.199391329819
Whistle brings rain
they say.	849.9160638177934
Must be some somewhere.	1196.2854140044617
Salt in the Ormond damp.	592.3640888758189
The body
feels the atmosphere.	1376.8533842206512
Old Betty’s joints are on the rack.	1089.9605820252061
Signs of rain it is.	752.5570600748473
The royal reader.	946.4336915828404
And distant hills
seem coming nigh.	1334.6457671107617
Bailey light.	592.3640888758189
Two, four, six, eight, nine.	1376.8650244983396
Has to change or
they might think it a house.	1569.990741009252
Grace Darling.	592.3640888758189
People afraid of
the dark.	536.227114748574
Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time.	1376.8650244983396
Jewels diamonds
flash better.	1196.3022706333559
Light is a kind of reassuring.	835.1766377375365
Not going to hurt
you.	1020.3484301869443
Better now of course than long ago.	1218.8133077525238
Country roads.	592.3640888758189
Still two types there are you bob against.	1700.0704807418442
Scowl or smile.	946.4336915828404
Pardon! Not at all.	482.27023701129264
Best time to spray plants too in
the shade after the sun.	1259.744999909376
Some light still.	946.4336915828404
Red rays are longest.	1196.3022706333559
Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
violet.	1253.958293558961
A star I see.	592.3640888758189
Can’t tell yet.	1196.289489039867
When three it’s
night.	1377.0676982268121
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	619.9444950879863
Looks like a phantom
ship.	1185.0196399284919
Trees are they?	528.9628741836711
An optical illusion.	946.4336915828404
Land of
the setting sun this.	1511.3492785443011
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	1512.671704955979
My native
land, goodnight.	1196.2980565823646
Dew falling.	592.3640888758189
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.	1767.739600179066
Brings on white
fluxions.	1196.3022706333559
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his
way up through.	2003.1076857853607
Might get piles myself.	1196.3022706333559
Sticks too like a summer cold,
sore on the mouth.	1823.401447629675
Cut with grass or paper worst.	1512.138816961438
Friction of the
position.	991.2065289246832
Like to be that rock she sat on.	1547.9970891277003
O sweet little, you don’t
know how nice you looked.	1030.1430643416438
I begin to like them at that age.	1409.6687302892014
Green
apples.	592.3640888758189
Grab at all that offer.	1376.8087584759508
Suppose it’s the only time we cross
legs, seated.	1205.7106927146447
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	1616.8130418810986
Happy
chairs under them.	1196.3022706333559
But it’s the evening influence.	973.798775471379
They feel all that.	842.9758546069495
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,
in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	1557.009416659478
Nightstock in Mat
Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	869.1348079433612
Wish I had a full length
oilpainting of her then.	1261.3316781526569
June that was too I wooed.	660.8976455289505
The year returns.	946.4336915828404
History repeats itself.	946.4248011905848
Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.	1196.3012231037876
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	1700.0387237191487
And now?	592.3640888758189
Sad about her
lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	1939.70215699804
They take advantage.	946.4336915828404
All quiet on Howth now.	592.3640888758189
The distant hills seem.	991.9789448889109
Where we.	592.3640888758189
The
rhododendrons.	592.3640888758189
I am a fool perhaps.	1376.8117115682135
He gets the plums, and I the
plumstones.	1003.5136546807956
Where I come in.	544.1391266458398
All that old hill has seen.	1334.5893420367831
Names change:
that’s all.	684.3959099912182
Tired I feel now.	841.8114424048898
Will I get up?	593.2325286349795
O wait.	592.3640888758189
Drained all the manhood out of
me, little wretch.	1557.985657837595
She kissed me.	647.1889183956465
Never again.	592.3640888758189
My youth.	592.3640888758189
Only once it
comes.	1196.2896282679212
Or hers.	592.3640888758189
Take the train there tomorrow.	1376.862154902959
Returning not the
same.	663.7331271345781
Like kids your second visit to a house.	1283.484360169716
The new I want.	592.3640888758189
Nothing
new under the sun.	623.2469809836942
Care of P.	592.3640888758189
Dolphin’s Barn.	592.3640888758189
Are you not happy in
your?	601.8760466643829
Naughty darling.	592.3640888758189
At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s
house.	740.9803865413727
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,
Louy, Hetty.	819.3008604030164
Molly too.	592.3640888758189
Eightyseven that was.	507.2284106919343
And the
old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	1823.5316075691342
Curious she an only child, I
an only child.	936.747344775984
So it returns.	946.4336915828404
Think you’re escaping and run into
yourself.	1700.061253133826
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	1547.8868672752021
And just when he
and she.	1177.9322087625776
Circus horse walking in a ring.	1334.093666554458
Rip van Winkle we played.	784.6746171349943
Van: breadvan delivering.	946.4292464214541
Winkle:
cockles and periwinkles.	1196.2980565823646
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	706.1503581367974
She
leaned on the sideboard watching.	1177.702350300409
Moorish eyes.	592.3640888758189
Twenty years asleep in
Sleepy Hollow.	748.7545201171381
All changed.	592.3640888758189
The young are old.	1196.3022706333559
His gun rusty
from the dew.	1511.5456665887598
What is that flying about?	1376.8383820829993
Bat probably.	592.3640888758189
Thinks I’m a
tree, so blind.	1322.6179019206352
Have birds no smell?	1196.2980565823661
Weeping willow.	592.3640888758189
There he
goes.	737.27542522507
Funny little beggar.	946.4336915828404
Wonder where he lives.	1196.2644553860184
Belfry up there.	737.2606705890719
Very
likely.	592.3640888758189
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	1392.5252160274542
Bell scared him
out, I suppose.	748.7545201171381
Mass seems to be over.	895.7639230300828
Could hear them all at it.	1197.4198485268425
Pray
for us.	409.62435312015543
And pray for us.	333.2485706826264
And pray for us.	333.2485706826264
Good idea the repetition.	1196.2980565823646
Same thing with ads.	1196.3033680726708
Buy from us.	593.5229010712899
And buy from us.	699.0599966957851
Yes, there’s the
light in the priest’s house.	861.9221875861027
Their frugal meal.	946.4336915828404
Remember about the
mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s.	1017.2706188570121
Twentyeight it is.	345.8160364225982
Two
houses they have.	991.9202133585163
Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate.	1196.3005365625759
Wonder
why they come out at night like mice.	1432.9619510169155
They’re a mixed breed.	1376.8223413318715
Birds are
like hopping mice.	1376.8572642759873
What frightens them, light or noise?	1512.138816961438
Better sit
still.	946.4336915828404
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of
a jar by throwing in pebbles.	1347.3459227665185
Like a little man in a cloak he is with
tiny hands.	1410.0457782568742
Weeny bones.	592.3640888758189
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey
white.	1302.0316502921837
Colours depend on the light you see.	1129.012879832504
Stare the sun for example
like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	1982.2768462291278
Wants
to stamp his trademark on everything.	1616.8260600451579
Instance, that cat this morning
on the staircase.	1183.1816462824775
Colour of brown turf.	1196.2907257625654
Say you never see them with
three colours.	1548.0446226815056
Not true.	592.3640888758189
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the
_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	1192.764847814191
Body fifty different
colours.	1196.3022706333559
Howth a while ago amethyst.	1376.862154902959
Glass flashing.	592.3640888758189
That’s how that
wise man what’s his name with the burning glass.	1533.598201923955
Then the heather goes
on fire.	1250.4253135331614
It can’t be tourists’ matches.	1334.5774986306483
Perhaps the sticks dry
rub together in the wind and light.	1377.6109934558397
Or broken bottles in the furze act
as a burning glass in the sun.	1333.8183539534257
I have it! My memory’s not
so bad.	1018.0053033026339
Who knows what they’re always flying for.	1548.0250293087356
That bee last
week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	1812.1287505034159
Birds too.	592.3640888758189
Never find out.	737.2581092110775
Or what
they say.	542.747792143866
Like our small talk.	1196.2980565823646
And says she and says he.	700.6516314421403
Nerve they
have to fly over the ocean and back.	1387.5281649250023
Lots must be killed in storms,
telegraph wires.	1699.9672830418162
Dreadful life sailors have too.	1376.8650244983396
Big brutes of
oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like
seacows.	1523.3449124665774
_Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in
vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake
when the stormy winds do blow.	1396.4004756601717
Married too.	592.3640888758189
Sometimes away for years at
the ends of the earth somewhere.	1031.265192075035
No ends really because it’s round.	1373.9586477985638
Wife in every port they say.	1011.5405876722206
She has a good job if she minds it till
Johnny comes marching home again.	1310.2311275761301
If ever he does.	843.0195446625462
Smelling the tail
end of ports.	1512.1686518942681
How can they like the sea?	892.724466191348
Yet they do.	593.5061754079976
The anchor’s
weighed.	1196.3022706333559
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	1945.498154373497
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on
his door to touch.	1623.259485075433
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into
the house of bondage.	525.8484010495094
Something in all those superstitions because when
you go out never know what dangers.	1788.3213806033634
Hanging on to a plank or astride of
a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and
that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	1656.382110812176
Do fish
ever get seasick?	1376.861144421135
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,
crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so
peaceful.	1582.0782157059039
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	1376.8495037818602
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of
funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of
violet but one white stars.	1565.47953178172
They floated, fell: they faded.	1376.8650244983396
The
shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	1491.414184101654
From house to
house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock
postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there
through the laurel hedges.	1996.8120008365165
And among the five young trees a hoisted
lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace.	1485.8118972951138
By screens of lighted
windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening
Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from
the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called.	1164.4855174085142
Twittering the bat
flew here, flew there.	1616.8195509831073
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,
grey.	1627.1580695912357
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum
rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,
ruffle his fell of ferns.	2168.3930649444064
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep
and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	2003.028112475808
And far on Kish bank the
anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	1017.1795958231261
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	1181.129992852557
Irish
Lights board.	592.3640888758189
Penance for their sins.	1196.2275046492878
Coastguards too.	592.3640888758189
Rocket and
breeches buoy and lifeboat.	1512.1317147529485
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in
the Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	1252.9545859004472
Bears in the
zoo.	1196.9347039177337
Filthy trip.	592.3640888758189
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	1616.8358585463905
And the women, fear of God in
their faces.	852.8457460323706
Milly, no sign of funk.	1376.8388735717942
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	1185.2756593705142
Don’t know what death is at that age.	1188.8715019475706
But being lost they fear.	1376.861144421135
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	1089.3117760489704
I
didn’t want to.	533.7884979503201
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	691.0129532452313
Frightening them with
masks too.	1376.8301013573916
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	804.4118737201492
I’ll murder you.	899.5892576106746
Is it only half fun?	1376.8301019884736
Or children playing battle.	1196.3022706333559
How can
people aim guns at each other.	1208.0924173942392
Sometimes they go off.	991.9519001219602
Poor kids! Only
troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	1082.0154678135393
Calomel purge I got her for that.	795.3371531760697
After getting better asleep with Molly.	946.431468999537
Very same teeth she has.	1185.272504915624
What
do they love?	1196.2317234179775
Another themselves?	592.3640888758189
But the morning she chased her with
the umbrella.	1625.958951794771
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	730.4334303320782
I felt her pulse.	1196.2980565823646
Dearest Papli.	592.3640888758189
All that the hand says when
you touch.	1547.8495427133582
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	1512.1413257594863
Her first stays I
remember.	592.3640888758189
Made me laugh to see.	841.2018723707463
Little paps to begin with.	1376.8650244983396
Left one is
more sensitive, I think.	885.1360695157966
Mine too.	592.3640888758189
Nearer the heart?	647.1836731082993
Padding themselves
out if fat is in fashion.	1548.0778614608294
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening
me.	1700.0245280667043
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	1627.1434711696477
Poor child!
Strange moment for the mother too.	1196.0439454566974
Brings back her girlhood.	1196.2980565823646
Looking from Buena Vista.	592.3640888758189
O’Hara’s tower.	841.8084770704346
The seabirds screaming.	946.4336915828404
Old
Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	1126.0872081796863
Sundown, gunfire for the men
to cross the lines.	1026.983733340567
Looking out over the sea she told me.	817.9755494776153
Evening like
this, but clear, no clouds.	1616.8138894748424
I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich
gentleman coming with a private yacht.	1597.4251862848835
_Buenas noches, señorita.	946.4292464214541
El
hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	1512.138816961438
Why me?	592.3640888758189
Because you were so foreign
from the others.	1409.1976502299187
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	1767.540046352773
This weather makes you
dull.	1376.8638858416302
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	1200.3015527373211
Go home.	592.3640888758189
Too late for
_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No.	592.3640888758189
Might be still up.	1196.3022706333559
Call to the hospital
to see.	884.6921179115532
Hope she’s over.	745.9255693069089
Long day I’ve had.	784.6746171349943
Martha, the bath, funeral,
house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song.	1017.1647340459201
Then that
bawler in Barney Kiernan’s.	724.1084873131331
Got my own back there.	1376.844485015134
Drunken ranters what
I said about his God made him wince.	869.1228501124475
Mistake to hit back.	1196.3022706333559
Always want to be swilling in
company.	1188.4377681603883
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	1280.8025443129793
Suppose he hit me.	1196.2980565823646
Look at it other way round.	1512.097830099829
Perhaps not to hurt he
meant.	1334.6403461732716
Three cheers for Israel.	592.3640888758189
Three cheers for the sister-in-law he
hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	1669.1390274724617
Same style of beauty.	745.9367348945866
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	1032.7586164357504
The sister of the wife of
the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	1051.6002378242051
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he
kissed the cow.	1148.9221983141501
Houses of mourning so
depressing because you never know.	1253.9007871587567
Anyhow she wants the money.	1096.0664876892863
Must
call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	692.5036115470126
Strange name.	592.3640888758189
Takes it for
granted we’re going to pop off first.	1525.2912048328255
That widow on Monday was it
outside Cramer’s that looked at me.	849.4983483882208
Buried the poor husband but
progressing favourably on the premium.	1823.549760835703
What do
you expect her to do?	1188.6608822503504
Must wheedle her way along.	1376.8572643548641
Widower I hate to
see.	546.6741904739869
Looks so forlorn.	946.4336915828404
Poor man O’Connor wife and five children
poisoned by mussels here.	1344.9581701841087
The sewage.	592.3640888758189
Some good matronly
woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	1870.6415109847812
Take him in tow, platter face and
a large apron.	1626.9872608704861
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	1257.525877726359
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	1250.3863973497719
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we
die.	1767.7681968238476
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the
trick.	1319.3725106991722
p: up.	261.28801817388336
Fate that is.	409.60727366331344
He, not me.	737.2909362695849
Also a shop often noticed.	1376.861144421135
Curse seems to dog it.	1376.8755859477965
Dreamt last night?	474.39923080154256
Something confused.	592.3640888758189
She
had red slippers on.	1185.2723192197807
Wore the breeches.	946.4248011905848
Suppose she does?	946.4203558902273
Would I like her in pyjamas?	1196.274041257258
Damned hard to answer.	1196.2390567153404
Nannetti’s gone.	593.5228089795995
Near Holyhead by now.	633.0232890222117
Work
Hynes and Crawford.	592.3640888758189
Petticoats for Molly.	592.3640888758189
She has something to put in
them.	1305.2230061198036
What’s that?	461.5357045536777
Might be money.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	1355.989977247825
He
brought it near his eyes and peered.	1366.7273665865036
Better go.	592.3640888758189
I’m tired to move.	1376.8339833192053
Page of an old copybook.	1185.0825698812098
All those holes and
pebbles.	1376.861144421135
Bottle with
story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	1795.0644467406023
Parcels post.	592.3640888758189
Children
always want to throw things in the sea.	821.1627986864302
Bread cast on the
waters.	943.3434008122504
What’s this?	946.407019572209
Bit of stick.	946.4336915828404
O! Exhausted that female has me.	1196.2994612643795
Not so young now.	1196.2854140044617
Will she come here
tomorrow?	1376.85051431677
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	1159.5408840010625
Must come back.	556.5745768315508
Murderers
do.	592.3640888758189
Will I?	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	1746.3915389913723
Write
a message for her.	859.4467674403446
Might remain.	592.3640888758189
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	668.7292447258562
Washed away.	592.3640888758189
Tide
comes here.	946.4292464214541
Saw a pool near her foot.	1512.0962026948503
Bend, see my face there, dark
mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	1871.04132925635
All these rocks with lines and scars and
letters.	1767.7661165133352
O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know.	500.6918736089999
What is the
meaning of that other world.	861.2634773993237
I called you naughty boy because I do not
like.	729.3186213968966
No room.	592.3640888758189
Let it go.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	1511.8777785425202
Hopeless thing sand.	946.4336915828404
Nothing grows in it.	542.7414239652257
All fades.	592.3640888758189
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	1700.0536974332447
Except Guinness’s barges.	841.8114424048898
Round the Kish in eighty days.	946.4336915828393
Done half by
design.	1196.2938424605543
He flung his wooden pen away.	1512.1352658891174
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	1616.8162964949868
Now
if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t.	1484.8750434254039
We’ll never meet again.	1376.8533842995278
But it was lovely.	992.1424215044077
Goodbye, dear.	592.3640888758189
Made
me feel so young.	1376.8416154617657
Short snooze now if I had.	748.7545201171381
Must be near nine.	1196.2896282679212
Liverpool boat long gone.	1196.2980565823661
Not even the smoke.	1196.272770789106
And she can do the other.	844.3466994446244
Did too.	592.3640888758189
And Belfast.	592.3640888758189
I
won’t go.	1196.2391883794608
Race there, race back to Ennis.	946.431468999537
Let him.	592.3640888758189
Just close my eyes a
moment.	873.1910514519568
Won’t sleep, though.	1196.3022706333559
Half dream.	592.3640888758189
It never comes the same.	859.4576437033633
Bat
again.	592.3640888758189
No harm in him.	1196.234838602882
Just a few.	647.128213425861
O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me

A bat flew.	946.4248011905848
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	1374.1823850259366
Mr Bloom
with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	1700.0604639776793
Just
for a few
	563.2834707581151
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon
O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	871.5254717175976
were
taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup
and talking about
	1999.188820777268
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to
tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there
because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty
MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was
sitting on the rocks looking was

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that
which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in
them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain
when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being
equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have
progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when
fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent
nature’s incorrupted benefaction.	2280.944159002869
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	1681.8597700519979
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have
sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
withering or loose boyconnell flux.	1620.607505373768
Certainly in every public work
which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with
importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it
is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent
inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)
whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that
whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly
required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who
not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely
could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was
provided.	2241.7717197087163
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
received into that domicile.	2184.767365477758
O thing of prudent nation not merely in
being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
	2134.4142865569515
Before born bliss babe had.	1376.8650244983396
Within womb won he worship.	1376.8650244983396
Whatever in
that one case done commodiously done was.	1626.4377867978847
A couch by midwives attended
with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though
forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no
less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are
pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting
spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together
with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct
females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright
wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and
reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	2326.7611012877924
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night’s oncoming.	1911.302349871138
Of
Israel’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	1787.5265204507211
Stark
ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	1837.1316678145304
Of that house A.	592.3640888758189
Horne is lord.	946.4336915828404
Seventy beds keeps he there teeming
mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale
so God’s angel to Mary quoth.	1592.930465554633
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters
in ward sleepless.	1767.7633489244881
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve
moons thrice an hundred.	1871.079885776621
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne
holding wariest ward.	1196.3022706333572
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising
with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	2001.5834454860058
Lo, levin leaping
lightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin.	1196.3022706333572
Full she drad that God
the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	1354.23610196939
Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe
infare under her thatch.	1891.681864369726
That man her will wotting worthful went in
Horne’s house.	1065.290303146432
Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	1344.9739646847427
On her stow
he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over
land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	2148.8768266602297
Once her in
townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	1795.5907687093259
Her to forgive now he
craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,
hers, so young then had looked.	2148.8121708725735
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of
blushes his word winning.	1871.024287355286
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	1911.338936313257
Glad
after she was that ere adread was.	1547.995572459629
Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor
tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered
that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was.	1226.8952283788415
Sad was the man that word to hear
that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	1445.9951748257656
All she there told him, ruing
death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to
withsay.	1668.897695764218
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His
goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil
to his limbs.	1341.823350716438
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death
the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was
died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas
and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his
undeathliness.	1431.315618092832
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	1823.8528752572392
So
stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	1911.3517016738174
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the
last for to go as he came.	1895.5522363098305
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman
and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in
childbed.	1907.0145511698117
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in
throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to
bear but that now in a little it would be.	1648.7148981254347
She said thereto that she
had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that
woman’s birth.	1947.1769438879564
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew
the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	1579.5222667035648
The man hearkened to
her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they
have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair
face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a
handmaid.	1929.1526674045153
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	1512.138816961438
And there
came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept
Dixon.	1616.7013671947595
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed
that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where
this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a
salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	1723.9226526718476
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	987.1297122325306
Also the lady
was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	2176.786431506898
But
the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a
marvellous castle.	1735.873803616914
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for
to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches
environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	1556.9440601798965
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
move more for enchantment.	1660.1000282390307
And on this board were frightful swords and
knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
abound marvellously.	2057.7723038599343
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic
of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that
he blases in to them like to bubbles.	1850.729255778501
And full fair cheer and rich was
on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	1796.0265268022474
And there
was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay
strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be
possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	2040.9055335974363
And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of
the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	1767.4958532312933
And
also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a
compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
to a vast mountain.	1789.040174463197
And they teach the serpents there to entwine
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	1697.601319584993
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	1693.507598175691
And childe
Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
his neighbour nist not of this wile.	2101.0046910432966
And he sat down in that castle
with them for to rest him there awhile.	1446.091646963933
Thanked be Almighty God.	592.3640888758189
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing
for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time
hied fast.	1519.6987580098003
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered
what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,
that it be not come or now.	1652.5829105846924
Meseems it dureth overlong.	1196.3022706333559
And he was ware
and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was
older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him full gently.	1648.36123493712
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring
forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath
waited marvellous long.	1787.5034843213505
And the franklin that had drunken said,
Expecting each moment to be her next.	1313.8826157800042
Also he took the cup that stood
tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to
drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far
as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his
lustiness.	1620.2975538913602
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat
in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that
ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight
of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged
him courtly in the cup.	1549.8119570384495
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.	1512.117510219477
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might.	1961.8047657526934
There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long
of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
beside the meek sir Leopold.	1217.119408559605
But on young Malachi they waited for that
he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
he had broke his avow.	1785.2641580538207
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	1636.219901770315
Ruth red
him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	1946.0929265912205
For they were right witty scholars.	1511.9668027800858
And he heard their aresouns each
gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining
that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen
out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house
that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next
before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her
case).	1766.7118033591416
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,
they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that
were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for
he had conscience to let her die.	1867.8068738212185
And not few and of these was young
Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it
was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the
law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	1903.7934626629794
A redress God grant.	592.3640888758189
This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,
the wife should live and the babe to die.	1590.6686192856491
In colour whereof they waxed
hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but
the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at
the least way mirth might not lack.	1979.0489671001196
Then young Madden showed all the
whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint
Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby
they were all wondrous grieved.	1658.9697530822325
Both babe and
parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in
purgefire.	1408.065841148019
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
God, Lord and Giver of Life?	1009.8424264278631
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	1700.517290533931
We
are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends
than we.	2026.636562733336
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	869.139261241786
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was
that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or
leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	1958.0734677175587
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the
other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they
did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do.	1591.8882572527036
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir
Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour
which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
whoso she might be or wheresoever.	1649.353620286555
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu
secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	1540.8045399124944
He said also how at the end of the
second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother
foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother
which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he
that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which
rock was holy church for all ages founded.	1812.919518646221
All they bachelors then
asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as
risk life to save life.	1779.7893197438304
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
questions.	2015.7102873053693
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant
word.	1017.1806983118043
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he
was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that
taking it appeared eftsoons.	1282.5293196685366
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny.	1948.9184509909355
And she was wondrous stricken of heart
for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him
his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness
and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
murdered his goods with whores.	2001.9198582934796
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying
for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge
the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	1823.934486898012
Now drink
we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed
parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.	2106.672475460703
Leave ye fraction of bread to
them that live by bread alone.	1911.2873569168055
Be not afeard neither for any want for
this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	1804.4794414323417
See ye here.	946.4336915828404
And he
showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the
worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song
which he writ.	1707.4621739457787
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such
dearth of money as was herebefore.	1749.1321204361952
His words were then these as
followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s
mansions.	1669.0899310070754
What means this?	946.4336915828404
Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after
it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	1747.9211099374047
Mark
me now.	593.517326024486
In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the
maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	1744.6623080429888
This is the postcreation.	1195.9880265680106
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	878.3805381550931
No question but
her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,
Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and
Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae
supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is
the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,
our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of
navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	1586.602756333771
But here is the matter now.	1334.420014411912
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was
but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or
she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy
with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with
Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,
_parceque M.	1438.8143088201227
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	1439.197847665335
A
pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without
blemish, a belly without bigness.	2066.835889326302
Let the lewd with faith and fervour
worship.	1548.087479592725
With will will we withstand, withsay.	1512.1255371387545
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was
it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no
gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	1567.4201107214285
It was an
ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in
habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of
them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness
some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,
thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou
chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the
good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,
margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and
most worthy to be most sacred.	2023.2697241078756
In Horne’s house rest should reign.	1322.6720808615632
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	1468.1595020830096
Master
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	1878.3044289305763
But he
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
the eternal son and ever virgin.	1579.4863753616278
Thereat mirth grew in them the more
and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing
and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,
with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries
and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
there unmaided.	1941.3480474322107
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:

Young Stephen
said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for
life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved
with it.	1699.0502875637073
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay
down his wife for his friend.	1586.6851669536925

Remember, Erin, thy

my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	1998.3020676784834
Therefore hast thou
sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
servants.	1860.1827952093206

But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon
and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	1804.1656740712583
And thou hast left me alone for
ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast
thou kissed my mouth.	1623.904812467169

Loud on
left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	1196.2988993571107
Came now the
storm that hist his heart.	1427.104030543418
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to
flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and
paganry.	1831.1842783193351
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as
they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before
so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart
shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that
storm.	2132.6803340080023
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard
again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he
was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	1553.4827218144735
But this was
only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.	1557.0552299603405
He
drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,
being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of
doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming
words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing
but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the
thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a
natural phenomenon.	1839.474592845949
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?	869.1303539887313
No, for he
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away.	1396.3490529898183
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
other?	1422.3662586406087
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	1285.8959364666985
But
could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	1755.1671945854112
Indeed no for Grace was not
there to find that bottle.	1275.20929885379
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	945.5100894951513
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
Understanding (which he had not done).	1264.9528130018412
For through that tube he saw
that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one
day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	1001.55534565341
By no means would he though
he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives
which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	1695.227759574884
Then wotted
he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the
land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for
ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering
at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	1475.4612062501033
Yes, Pious had told
him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason
was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing
exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him
wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,
Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave
place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot
which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal
Concupiscence.	1372.2428729231165
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
know her.	1674.5609796210992
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but
notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
named Killchild.	1485.9370551723114
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	735.5459250600998
Wherein, O wretched company,
were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill
their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	1711.3592170606112
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	592.3640888758189
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields
athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	2066.564915711901
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without
sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	1795.7710506585781
The
rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought
but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	2002.131772893048
All the world
saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that
did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	1847.635483290026
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in
the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and
the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first
and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder
and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the
smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
pour came.	2109.2263076583517
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through
Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no
more crack after that first.	1508.790199996422
Mr Justice
Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the
college lands) Mal.	1033.721426504864
Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come
from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a
good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	1324.7848162956811
Bannon in a cut bob (which are
now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a
month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup
of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
so both together on to Horne’s.	1627.2084900722941
There Leop.	592.3640888758189

jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin.	1262.9568820627592

Madden, T.	592.3640888758189
Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	1275.2037709464616
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having
dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers
on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be
for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading
her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,
the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of
riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very
heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they
say, but God give her soon issue.	1798.0900871680324
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,
and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth
and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand
in the king’s bible.	1652.3037111096905
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the
sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys
off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in
a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,
I hear.	1740.7881299384937
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and
will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and
water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I
hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out
of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in
all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and
bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their
queerities no telling how.	1736.2259712989228
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the
letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about
him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk.	1522.300814312852
To tell the truth he
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues
of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at
nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much
loose gossip.	2081.266128683847
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but
gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a
bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his
tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
mother’s son of them would burst their sides.	1981.8749317704305
The other, Costello that
is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	1660.6048919154262
Faith, no, he
says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to
be butchered along of the plague.	1264.180434223391
But they can go hang, says he with a
wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	1699.0305923931387
There’s as good fish
in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take
of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the
meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
embassy as he was sharpset.	1757.2511669393725
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the
French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a
winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	1166.0593575828843
From a
child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,
who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of
the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but
he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	1899.0344938057713
One
time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought
would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for
the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,
kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’
linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	1960.6245739096223
He had been off as many times
as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to
his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw
him.	1991.428112090656
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to
know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	1579.9270786534883
I protest I saw them but
this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	967.1085666616578
I can scarce
believe ’tis so bad, says he.	1236.659137856929
And he had experience of the like brood
beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.	1561.0238685952438
I question with you there, says he.	1021.3113780142357
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	1626.4550147575885
Mr Stephen, a little
moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had
dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the
hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted
cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the
bull by the horns.	1452.8110120352655
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	724.1084873131331
He’ll
find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s
Irish, says he.	1404.370145916948
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and
he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	1196.2636398954226
I
conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	748.7545201171381
It is that same bull that was sent to our
island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with
an emerald ring in his nose.	1538.0383114204917
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the
table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a
portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	1492.1500263041596
He had horns galore, a
coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his
nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	1643.8513805854811
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself.	1462.5040609832024
So be off now, says he, and do all my
cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing,
and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	1624.7269171628432
But the slap and
the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess
and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the
month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the
nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	1732.1816433860668
Another then put in his
word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his
forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables
for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of
the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart’s content.	1857.3100502848881
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	1809.1577523279936
To
remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in
their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on
his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow
out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.	1848.6218491709667
Ay, says another,
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
grass that grows on the ground.	1305.2919135371396
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a
husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or
a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.	1405.8321496018027
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the
lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in
his matters, says he.	1126.2369611757745
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	1737.449755978427
But one evening, says
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to
dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he
found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
boss of the show.	1603.6980391029613
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	1354.5923530744205
Then, with the
water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language
to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if
ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	1954.3744960761414
In short, he and the bull of Ireland
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	1603.9375219746078
They were, says Mr
Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was
toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,
loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all
masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread
three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times
three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea
to recover the main of America.	1884.0416895660153
Which was the occasion, says Mr
Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
	1470.53302097753
_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.	1081.9768267834734
A man’s a man for a’ that._
	1557.106986524299
Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	1646.7399037997063
Mr Mulligan was civil
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on.	1723.5600861750813
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	1328.9042886230663
Fertiliser and
Incubator.	592.3640888758189
Lambay Island_.	592.3640888758189
His project, as he went on to expound, was
to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief
business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has
been framed.	1681.9615826839797
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	1187.131680511223
I
make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	1700.055911947131
Come, be seated, both.	1196.2980565823646
’Tis as
cheap sitting as standing.	1512.138816961438
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,
expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into
this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the
inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from
proclivities acquired.	2036.5068740777176
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the
nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so
many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest
bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty
fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart
weep.	2137.304741094319
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
ascendancy party.	1759.6548546828342
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
natural.	1928.0960768680886
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
his pains.	1636.8249530341895
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of
fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	2058.631358625259
For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies.	2206.879617024243
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
with which he had shielded it.	1484.6760416513487
They both, it seems, had been overtaken
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which
was now somewhat piebald.	1819.0749589477305
His project meanwhile was very favourably
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	1684.629133382487
Mr Mulligan however made
court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as
it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of
his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut
matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
farmyard drake and duck.	1893.3836462699446
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced.	2208.6262480359146
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour.	1758.8244017288732
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give?	1872.719156907244
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	1819.307922536632
Mr
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
stomach.	1660.7527122659912
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,
smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex
though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a
bastard.	1605.1013968715286
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth
and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	2095.0841845891646
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some
larum in the antechamber.	1594.2776058766028
_Mais bien
sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	1871.0491181026798
That
you may and very opportunely.	1512.069640349457
There wanted nothing but this cup to
crown my felicity.	1823.8381247464145
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
of good things.	1531.0844697393093
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening
his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	2101.014090217759
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands
of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	1797.8416438807672
I declare, I was never
so touched in all my life.	1177.7294546762942
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
favours.	1413.4260930735763
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	2018.7974452445633
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished
coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of
maturer years.	1847.645715410344
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	869.9716551027723
How mingled
and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	1767.7363924071765
Maledicity! he exclaimed in
anguish.	1376.8572643548641
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	1042.0103387924344
Then, though it had poured
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	1933.8652319067144
But beshrew me,
he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day
and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur
Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the
French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	1379.054459445207
Tut, tut! cries Le
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
the stoutest cloak.	1447.264695993429
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans
blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest
posthaste to another world.	2082.7841776332934
Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.	724.1084873131331
The
clumsy things are dear at a sou.	1699.981848426527
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a
fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	1812.6283214976877
No woman of any wit would
wear one.	1700.036322020633
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge
before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she
reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there
was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the
divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is
the fittest, nay, the only garment.	1990.9959188911653
The first, said she (and here my
pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),
the first is a bath...	1925.3143247324995
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall
cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of
our store of knowledge.	2039.468204311363
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
a profound bow to the company.	1527.0844374327833
The presence even for a moment among a
party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
ribaldry.	1953.9000820928875
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	1275.2128970334172
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused
you.	1462.3380378410934
What, you dog?	946.4292464214541
Have you a way with them?	1250.345098942397
Gad’s bud, immensely so,
said Mr Lynch.	1003.524259793509
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
hospice.	1223.0897043083853
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
chin.	1133.2775297841433
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been
wardmaid there any time these seven months.	1359.3120920068147
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried
the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and
with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the
man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.	1530.55221464735
Why, you’re as bad as dear
little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half
choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	1196.014895491232
I knows a lady
what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	1347.3552483248416
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	1938.4991394914196
I want patience,
said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence
due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	1777.73386539481
I
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
breast.	1644.5019799527975
I cannot away with them.	1096.0650085940363
Malign such an one, the amiable
Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of
ours?	1391.5410216330151
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child
of clay?	2002.9076136975652
Having
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door.	1609.860001794239
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were
for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have
been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had
he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of
the true fold as ever drew breath.	1887.1947447067944
Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
back on with a loving heart.	1657.3331982286625
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	1844.097577001856
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	2189.2765761210644
But the word of Mr
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	1688.5493022507465
It was
now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had
passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a
wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his
heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting
them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that
plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	2052.282604844731
To those who create
themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which
he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the
name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such
that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a
precipitate and inglorious retreat.	2190.5815315871882
Not but what he could feel with
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy
Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far
forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	1942.752623285567
To conclude, while
from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence
that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the
Supreme Being.	1856.63317947147
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	2016.7370408879058
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
matron.	1348.9364781045601
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table
so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum
was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
calls her.	1432.6007705779514
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event
would burst anon.	1873.2649424149852
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.	996.9519104492322
I cannot but extol
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her.	1492.848004129719
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
eminent have esteemed the noblest.	2247.0847467009557
But, he further added, it is mayhap
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	1829.2266851403583
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity?	2151.1651052108978
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled?	1823.823967054389
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents?	2102.524560848474
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	1823.7769684870357
Or is
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	1950.206625926034
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	1903.6269655314047
Unhappy
woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than
the derision of the desperate.	2136.4376410852383
He says this, a censor of morals, a very
pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of
nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush
not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with
Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from
an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as
straightforward as they were bucolic.	1803.981856405786
It ill becomes him to preach that
gospel.	1700.0107979276206
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the
want of the ploughshare?	1844.8838821928648
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second
nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	1775.7982395138818
If he must dispense his balm
of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to
health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
better with the doctrines that now engross him.	1987.2893413830648
His marital breast is
the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	1976.261027304045
The
lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort
neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native
orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,
transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,
acid and inoperative.	2224.7569553737585
When he had betaken himself to
the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
tongues.	2051.2582869316157
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	1147.8233771062055
The moment was too propitious for the
display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union
among tempers so divergent.	2054.6814446157723
Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
illustrations.	1828.0034932735373
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
seat of castigation.	2083.1296117149977
The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,
supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain
were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical
explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens
was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born.	1808.3766660734345
The
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,
envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some
stage antecedent to the human.	1849.9163609196326
An outlandish delegate sustained against
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of
the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down
to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	1699.8939433166872
The impression made by his
words was immediate but shortlived.	1823.7700569249005
It was effaced as easily as it had
been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	1625.9965713484637
Contemporaneously,
a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	1138.7486433511021
Hitherto silent, whether the
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
joined.	1959.0968725675418
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	1391.2940977536878
He conjured up
the scene before them.	1452.5842330787282
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back
and in the recess appeared...	1509.2183309236261
Haines! Which of us did not feel his
flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,
in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were
depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	1389.0888409379609
I
anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for
which, it seems, history is to blame.	1522.5656913216794
Yes, it is true.	699.1485649065816
I am the
murderer of Samuel Childs.	885.1320413831711
And how I am punished! The inferno has no
terrors for me.	870.2915855787378
This is the appearance is on me.	1373.5507272947393
Tare and ages, what
way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping
Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the
like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	1527.082491096165
My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this
life.	825.248129783013
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	1106.4076640481162
Distractions,
rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised
the phial to his lips), camping out.	1435.4121698430433
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	946.4336915828393
Dope is my only hope...	1376.8262206686227
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry
he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	1305.8843244039383
An instant later his head
appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station
at ten past eleven.	1181.3588298419484
He was gone.	737.2874734175336
Tears gushed from the eyes of the
dissipated host.	1361.9246519075468
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The
vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	808.2793501917763
The
sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense
debtorship for a thing done.	1026.7458157035976
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	1376.8650244983396
The mystery was unveiled.	1196.3022706333559
Haines was the third brother.	1185.0496308980476
His real name
was Childs.	784.6751929979457
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	1028.3038096710868
He drank drugs to obliterate.	1376.861144421135
For this relief much thanks.	878.3805381550931
The lonely
house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	1699.624441808219
No soul will live there.	1376.8572642759873
The
spider pitches her web in the solitude.	1548.5075385619493
The nocturnal rat peers from
his hole.	1616.711859749656
A curse is on it.	926.8553994387609
It is haunted.	946.4336915828404
Murderer’s ground.	737.2943990675084
What is the age of the soul of man?	904.9465049075611
As she hath the virtue of the
chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
her mood.	2187.836111307934
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
modest substance in the funds.	1829.8975103056264
A score of years are blown away.	1373.7770763193932
He is
young Leopold.	592.3640888758189
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	1649.774760799949
That young figure
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from
the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel
on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a
mother’s thought.	1874.79361046579
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in
his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a
fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,
a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright
trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out
upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but
the heart?	2013.400157434732
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.	1400.1437651107983
The scent, the smile, but,
more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at
duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s
pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you
may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some
paper from the Europe of a month before.	1843.3068893439176
But hey, presto, the mirror is
breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a
tiny speck within the mist.	1994.6016947725345
Now he is himself paternal and these about
him might be his sons.	1734.159446979067
The wise father knows his own
child.	1452.5942278612804
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the
bonded stores there, the first.	1407.59360899281
Together (she is a poor waif, a child
of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her
luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two
raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	1939.5620676320893
Bridie! Bridie Kelly!
He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,
the bridenight.	1597.8561499769723
Did heart leap to heart?	1376.853384062898
Nay, fair reader.	946.4336915828404
In a breath ’twas
done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away
through the murk.	1247.4259483223277
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	1347.005121191677
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	1626.5727543926766
No, Leopold.	592.3640888758189
Name and
memory solace thee not.	1512.138816961438
That youthful illusion of thy strength was
taken from thee—and in vain.	1782.7052697244394
No son of thy loins is by thee.	1700.055768540766
There is
none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	861.7754174759558
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over
regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	1962.313847406222
A region where grey
twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,
shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	2054.9625789296647
Twilight
phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim
shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	2126.143432399435
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	1616.8118808463355
Agendath is a waste land, a home
of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	1945.4811776971849
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	944.868533330072
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	2047.1530632282945
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks
behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are
scorpions.	1597.8111640281481
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and
mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	1196.1148857221744
Ominous
revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned
and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the
giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all
their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	1791.1537094981693
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	1841.6929624668103
And the equine
portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s
own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	1755.7058861694848
And lo,
wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger
of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	1925.3844977567462
It is she, Martha, thou lost
one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	965.6611327470584
How serene does she
now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan
hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you
call it gossamer.	1530.3924711351415
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and
loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply
swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a
myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled
sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	1999.6479402089406
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
school together in Conmee’s time.	1005.7329202589323
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
Pisistratus.	592.3640888758189
Where were they now?	1196.2559121769154
Neither knew.	592.3640888758189
You have spoken of the
past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	927.7177795523841
Why think of them?	535.7284825598597
If I call them
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
my call?	1452.1731862357647
Who supposes it?	946.4336915828404
He encircled his gadding hair
with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	1567.2335790061527
That answer and those
leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your
genius father.	1829.419300209743
All who wish you well hope this for you.	1324.184443896028
All desire to
see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you
Stephaneforos.	1406.2979788220414
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	1700.0185419621816
O no, Vincent
Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	1157.1012067208078
Have no fear.	946.4304040663756
He
could not leave his mother an orphan.	1548.0365299162565
The young man’s face grew dark.	1305.1553869704505
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and
of his recent loss.	1452.1381314855448
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the
noise of voices allayed the smart.	1856.5697978184915
Madden had lost five drachmas on
Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.	1336.4410077462478
He told
them of the race.	866.4554409932396
Madden up.	592.3640888758189
She was leading the field.	1001.2651296669225
All hearts
were beating.	1196.2938425462191
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	1196.2559690701655
She waved her
scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run
home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,
reached, outstripped her.	1372.2266273105981
All was lost now.	803.3738115869837
Phyllis was silent: her
eyes were sad anemones.	1474.1848421864606
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	748.7545201171381
But her lover
consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some
oval sugarplums which she partook.	2126.0421644746393
A tear fell: one only.	1376.8650244983396
A whacking
fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	841.8114424048898
Four winners yesterday and three
today.	1512.1210612500947
What rider is like him?	1185.2598281680785
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous
buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	1875.1449619673624
But let us bear it
as was the ancient wont.	1823.648159596511
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said
with a light sigh.	888.1457138022444
She is not the filly that she was.	861.18780863159
Never, by this
hand, shall we behold such another.	1767.7529991709164
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	1021.588074297022
Do
you remember her, Vincent?	784.6684860930409
I wish you could have seen my queen today,
Vincent said.	1191.2450340868759
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair
beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the
right name of it.	1274.713522187127
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air
drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	2113.187429665716
In
the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of
those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his
booth near the bridge.	1524.2763614889086
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm
with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I
pressed too close.	1567.5229320589478
She is more taking then.	1376.861144421135
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we
reclined together.	1462.9823920079994
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who
met us as we left the field.	1666.449159863989
Conmee himself! He was walking by the
hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty
letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	1141.6747193485655
The sweet creature
turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very
trees adore her.	2034.4471317443295
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo
in that little mirror she carries.	1573.8896598516515
But he had been kind.	818.45694672827
In going by he
had blessed us.	1452.7868367154506
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	1003.5224923028728
If I had poor
luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
propensely.	1549.734997344634
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	1447.442911133246
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	1322.66050282485
His soul is far
away.	1096.0703825202
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born.	1765.7855878772286
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods.	1535.8957313563321
Do you not think it, Stephen?	835.3312839411583
Theosophos
told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	1376.626888201833
The lords of the
moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of
the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation.	1651.3757746003168
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
not the case at all.	1705.9571876661714
The individual whose visual organs while the above
was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
speedily in the wrong shop.	2169.502594643954
During the past four minutes or thereabouts
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its
scarlet appearance.	1291.7548176725488
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	2047.5749865634093
Eventually, however, both
their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other
was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the
neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid
sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out
with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it
about the place.	1732.9485680915338
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life.	1479.9304269708487
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	1700.070883610277
The
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
the loftiest and most vital.	1900.7842042755294
The high hall of Horne’s house had never
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old
rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic.	1894.4974891475813
A gallant scene in truth it made.	1616.8195510492678
Crotthers was there at
the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	1019.4241854588731
There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
depravity and premature wisdom.	1668.9507051972744
Next the Scotchman was the place
assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in
stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	1296.9981003082796
The chair of the resident
indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the
figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	1660.6931644193896
Lastly at the head of the
board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of
Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated
the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained
by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and
constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever
efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired
pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	1877.8780103575489
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S.	1479.9815711899682
Scep.) contentions
would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter
to accepted scientific methods.	2047.6994041298465
Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.	1871.0631083950436
The man of science like the
man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked
and explain them as best he can.	1607.373564385997
There may be, it is true, some
questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first
problem submitted by Mr L.	1525.2177622394631
Bloom (Pubb.	592.3640888758189
Canv.) regarding the future
determination of sex.	1616.8073800992793
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of
Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert
others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long
neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is
it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,
Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture
of both?	1470.313548424471
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s
favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on
the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus
felix_, of the passive element.	1835.9536269981165
The other problem raised by the same
inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	1873.1332238473403
It is interesting
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways.	1524.265558467068
Mr M.	592.3640888758189
Mulligan (Hyg.	592.3640888758189
et Eug.	592.3640888758189
Doc.) blames
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	2003.0309182187768
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk
in dust.	2415.9595275140628
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles
offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers
of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	2096.8347467313556
Kalipedia, he prophesied,
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as
Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	1862.2531498566852
Mr
J.	592.3640888758189
Crotthers (Disc.	592.3640888758189
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy
labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by
far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in
the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or
in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	2041.8632058705653
Although the former (we are
thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of
nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too
rare to be normative.	2150.9595570389965
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,
all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
often baulk nature in her intentions.	1854.7820988172782
An ingenious suggestion is that
thrown out by Mr V.	1196.2906963193961
Lynch (Bacc.	592.3640888758189
Arith.) that both natality and
mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal
movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained.	1974.1192712316779
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly
looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other
children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s
words, give us pause.	1990.461889256014
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
of the fittest.	2241.11003369246
Mr S.	592.3640888758189
Scep.) remark (or should it be
called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly
find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to.	2140.8433229605553
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately
acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this
morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening
bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid
from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated
that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
dropped from its mother.	2178.502730167818
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	1003.5224923028716
Bloom (Pubb.	592.3640888758189
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as
is well known, Dr A.	958.8205799199752
Horne (Lic.	592.3640888758189
in Midw., F.	592.3640888758189
I.) is the
able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having
stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s
allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of
all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.	1950.084867432723
At the risk
of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the
less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was
delivered.	1824.4043323086105
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
and doctor.	1755.290197775108
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
woman had manfully helped.	1905.0206420817424
She had.	592.3640888758189
She had fought the good fight and
now she was very very happy.	1499.5913811153866
Those who have passed on, who have gone
before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
scene.	2126.0292024127534
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the
motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty
sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,
breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal
Husband.	1505.7879476338667
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,
to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful
embraces.	1755.0456312065842
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle
stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity
has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,
College Green branch.	1519.2384962042627
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,
it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old
shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	1699.3366339203876
God! How beautiful now
across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her
imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,
Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),
Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our
famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and
Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever
there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	1012.5859324891956
Young hopeful will be
christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr
Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.	854.7448528021081
And so
time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	1344.9814497768396
No, let no
sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	1449.066079477119
And Doady, knock the
ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the
curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light
whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so
with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	1868.1880561839716
He knows and will call in His
own good time.	1196.2925958571275
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally
your man’s part.	1683.2219669666088
Sir, to you my hand.	1096.0405723176377
Well done, thou good and faithful
servant!
	1616.8162963626678
There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the
heart but they abide there and wait.	1976.6079998616228
He may suffer their memory to grow
dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade
himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	1987.1767369932547
Yet a chance
word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront
him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while
timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with
wine.	1991.9118346116413
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,
reproachful.	2115.9295755707153
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.	2046.686826017077
A scene
disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a
word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	2041.9914126554083
A shaven space
of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward
over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief
alert shock.	1845.6410040574317
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at
times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,
Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of
arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of
them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin
so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	1644.6373204906856
A lad of four or five in
linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth
when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the
urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	2128.968490307838
He frowns a little
just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment
of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother
watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint
shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad
look.	2115.3438016346167
Mark this farther and remember.	1376.8572643548641
The end comes suddenly.	1196.3022706333559
Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
faces.	1763.8388047842382
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	1626.5826615509545
Quietude of
custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
ago.	1559.4592610848001
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched
field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in
an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of
the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was
the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of
the word.	2150.2669932846366
Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and
bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,
punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,
ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and
what not.	1488.515229569386
A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there.	1767.7688841065128
Nurse
Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon
coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a
milligramme.	2054.3871094878073
They hark him on.	1196.2785985832954
The door! It is open?	784.6701945885609
Ha! They are out,
tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s
of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal.	1196.55026782701
Dixon follows giving them
sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on.	2003.0288688569547
Bloom stays with
nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up
there.	1982.3831024205838

pallor.	1512.081801216893
Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers
close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?	1728.7496332302308
The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._
God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.	1467.1061846863636
By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done
a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest
progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most
farraginous chronicle.	1487.8783816114183
Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven
preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of
man’s work.	1313.8711097030564
Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog
and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang.	1241.2919816124963
Thou art all their
daddies, Theodore.	835.3292126976057

bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse?	2083.893225661999

Pshaw, I tell

worth a cracked kreutzer.	1584.6067392633145
Copulation without population! No, say I!
Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name.	1196.0556300598018
Vegetables,
forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,
bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,
quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney,
Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet,
varicose veins.	1608.2691372542467
A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all
such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.	1728.7934629869612

Drink, man, an udderful! Mother’s
milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning
stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those
rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the
honeymilk of Canaan’s land.	1685.030586095572

	1085.9246830124312
EDY BOARDMAN: _(Bickering.)_ And says the one: I seen you up Faithful
place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his
cometobed hat.	1227.8522751983958
Did you, says I.	592.3640888758189
That’s not for you to say, says I.	1095.0501559386091
You
never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I.	1240.2512403728977
The
likes of her! Stag that one is! Stubborn as a mule! And her walking
with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and
lancecorporal Oliphant.	1006.7969390200732
STEPHEN: _(Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti sunt._
	885.1534237904042
_(He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering
light over the world.	1310.1407367631964
A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks
after him, growling.	1795.410187431835
Lynch scares it with a kick.)_
	1188.8439488527026
STEPHEN: (_Looks behind_.) So that gesture, not music not odour, would
be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the
lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.	1697.7354034609855
LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology.	592.3640888758189
Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!
	592.3640888758189
STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates.	592.3640888758189
Even
the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of
love.	1219.6256023450205
LYNCH: Ba!
	592.3640888758189
STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?	1746.410150157057
This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar.	1396.969168477618
Hold my stick.	737.2943990675084
LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick.	1039.41860477134
Where are we going?	899.5828152081011
STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to _la belle dame sans merci,_ Georgina
Johnson, _ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam._
	1439.3633977930826
_(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,
his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down
turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left
being higher.)_
	2021.4428039480897
LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread?	1067.6182754895844
It skills not.	946.4292464214541
That or the
customhouse.	1196.0977785758118
Illustrate thou.	592.3640888758189
Here take your crutch and walk.	1512.121061466664
_(They pass.	592.3640888758189
Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs
in spasms.	1646.4354887952015
From the top spur he slides down.	1616.878365448171
Jacky Caffrey clasps to
climb.	1039.4156756356842
The navvy lurches against the lamp.	1250.3217831843733
The twins scuttle off in the
dark.	805.7753151087759
The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his
nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot.	1805.8131277976343
Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his
flaring cresset._
	1694.8164269825077
_Snakes of river fog creep slowly.	1512.138816961438
From drains, clefts, cesspools,
middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes.	1596.539381846238
A glow leaps in the south
beyond the seaward reaches of the river.	1682.691376849454
The navvy, staggering forward,
cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding.	1795.5674798519012
On the farther
side under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming
bread and chocolate into a sidepocket.	1244.8008706874944
From Gillen’s hairdresser’s
window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson’s image.	1309.7800136648302
A concave
mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru
Booloohoom.	1435.9489687568769
Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom.	706.1578209475638
He passes,
struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror
grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the
rixdix doldy._
	1478.9954694715948
_At Antonio Rabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright
arclamp.	1063.987280424452
He disappears.	592.3640888758189
In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)_
	1496.6713019210592
BLOOM: Fish and taters.	841.8114424048898
_(He disappears into Olhausen’s, the porkbutcher’s, under the
downcoming rollshutter.	1030.7012785831057
A few moments later he emerges from under the
shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom.	1118.8798017391157
In each hand he holds a
parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold
sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper.	1742.2392280508989
He gasps, standing
upright.	1196.3022706333559
Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs
and groans.)_
	1696.1353836735611
BLOOM: Stitch in my side.	894.6879132106519
Why did I run?	592.3640888758189
_(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset
siding.	1694.3707055687632
The glow leaps again.)_
	1040.6234828008705
BLOOM: What is that?	439.41202838100514
A flasher?	592.3640888758189
_(He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching.)_
	946.4328219210281
BLOOM: _Aurora borealis_ or a steel foundry?	1322.488040995205
Ah, the brigade, of
course.	870.1494567248857
South side anyhow.	946.4336915828404
Big blaze.	592.3640888758189
Might be his house.	1196.2612251302735
Beggar’s
bush.	946.4336915828404
We’re safe.	946.4336915828404
_(He hums cheerfully.)_ London’s burning, London’s
burning! On fire, on fire! (_He catches sight of the navvy lurching
through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street._) I’ll miss
him.	930.0159354840541
Better cross here.	946.4336915828404
_(He darts to cross the road.	847.1232802420585
Urchins shout.)_
	946.4336915828404
THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister!

(_Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him,
grazing him, their bells rattling._)

THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Halts erect, stung by a spasm.)_ Ow!
	1039.3123822279576
_(He looks round, darts forward suddenly.	1322.6578404480322
Through rising fog a dragon
sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its
huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire.	2158.8613330148805
The
motorman bangs his footgong.)_
	1512.138816961438
THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.	592.3640888758189
_(The brake cracks violently.	1039.41860477134
Bloom, raising a policeman’s whitegloved
hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track.	1481.345870094229
The motorman, thrown
forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over
chains and keys.)_
	2066.393630050467
THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?	1110.586908566162
_(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again.	1390.8176461357011
He brushes a
mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)_
	1737.5262127890683
BLOOM: No thoroughfare.	592.3640888758189
Close shave that but cured the stitch.	1616.8260600451579
Must
take up Sandow’s exercises again.	885.1516420694329
On the hands down.	676.4946992965891
The Providential.	592.3640888758189
_(He feels his trouser pocket.)_
Poor mamma’s panacea.	1122.2518117134405
Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog.	1823.423279295239
Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard’s
corner.	1006.2185819532867
Third time is the charm.	1095.8732120882833
Shoe trick.	592.3640888758189
Insolent driver.	592.3640888758189
I ought
to report him.	1376.929640904649
Tension makes them nervous.	1196.3010339675943
Might be the fellow balked
me this morning with that horsey woman.	1911.2283034625996
Same style of beauty.	745.9367348945866
Quick of
him all the same.	488.4588663987497
The stiff walk.	946.4336915828404
True word spoken in jest.	751.1917659410439
That awful
cramp in Lad lane.	748.7545201171381
Something poisonous I ate.	592.3640888758189

Probably lost cattle.	946.4336915828404
Mark of the beast.	698.5094628707196

instant.)_ Bit light in the head.	1000.3990861547171
Monthly or effect of the other.	733.8498710580565
That tired feeling.	737.2943990675084
Too much for me now.	1040.641197947354
_(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O’Beirne’s wall, a
visage unknown, injected with dark mercury.	1477.115470394529

	1626.5707581874285
BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right.	971.7882418737954
If there is a signpost planted
by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon?	1093.5967608480628
I who
lost my way and contributed to the columns of the _Irish Cyclist_ the
letter headed _In darkest Stepaside_.	1196.0893256060065
Keep, keep, keep to the right.	659.4792107446519
Rags and bones at midnight.	1185.2622985170901
A fence more likely.	1196.3022706333559

Bloom.)_

_(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts.	1322.66050282485
Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.	946.4336915828393

pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap.)_
	1735.0843926854777
BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets.	841.8114424048898
Old thieves’ dodge.	946.4336915828404
Then snatch
your purse.	1196.3022706333559
_(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground.	919.5391147548919

caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels.	1668.15386144342

RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today.	1196.3022706333559
I told you not go with
drunken goy ever.	1626.558943157205
So you catch no money.	1376.861144421135
BLOOM: _(Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and,
crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat.) Ja, ich weiss, papachi._

RUDOLPH: What you making down this place?	1188.4180997912833
Have you no soul?	1196.2854143471307
_(With
feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.)_ Are you not
my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold?	1056.5144171395646
Are you not my dear son
Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his
fathers Abraham and Jacob?	768.7880364709088
BLOOM: _(With precaution.)_ I suppose so, father.	809.5711234688673
All that’s
left of him.	865.4344433922305
RUDOLPH: _(Severely.)_ One night they bring you home drunk as dog after

What you call them running chaps?	1334.6430518080738
BLOOM: _(In youth’s smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,
narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent’s sterling silver
waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one
side of him coated with stiffening mud.)_ Harriers, father.	1407.227735967656
Only that
once.	946.4114650810416
RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot.	946.4259588505366
Cut your hand open.	1196.2960373693452
They make
you kaputt, Leopoldleben.	784.6597134783747
You watch them chaps.	1196.3022706333559
BLOOM: _(Weakly.)_ They challenged me to a sprint.	964.2479295376362
It was muddy.	946.4336915828404

slipped.	592.3640888758189

ELLEN BLOOM: _(In pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s
crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind,
grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,
appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her
hand, and cries out in shrill alarm.)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have
they done to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and
ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat.	1630.5103704784026
A phial, an Agnus
Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.)_ Sacred Heart
of Mary, where were you at all at all?	1047.1230292314972

his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)_

A VOICE: _(Sharply.)_ Poldy!

_(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.)_ At your
service.	1192.032380851782
_(He looks up.	841.8084770704346

Turkish costume stands before him.	1242.5407285889933

trousers and jacket, slashed with gold.	1911.3230080490796
A wide yellow cummerbund
girdles her.	1512.138816961438

leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)_

Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to

_(Satirically.)_ Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?	1263.5851385537212

Not the least little bit.	1376.8259647930101
_(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,
hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,
spellbound.	1794.6233915098974
A coin gleams on her forehead.	1056.7899229499876
On her feet are jewelled
toerings.	1512.1210613944768
Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain.	1699.8387447406612

camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits.	1823.2138380546469
A silk ladder of
innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah.	1870.8723785243494
He ambles near with
disgruntled hindquarters.	1512.138816961438

_(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,
offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops
his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel.	1903.337537713997

stoops his back for leapfrog.)_

MARION: So you notice some change?	1196.3022706333559
_(Her hands passing slowly over her
trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)_ O Poldy,
Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life.	1209.776737504163
BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower
water.	1234.464734219233
Shop closes early on Thursday.	784.6746171349943
But the first thing in the
morning.	615.1742605348312
_(He pats divers pockets.)_ This moving kidney.	946.4336915828404
_(He points to the south, then to the east.	1085.2503501561957
A cake of new clean lemon
soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)_
	1946.0957241306514
THE SOAP:
	592.3640888758189
We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I.	946.41887337497
He brightens the earth.	712.6381869104761
I polish the sky.	843.0254479061394

For my wife.	647.1690971058431
Mrs Marion.	592.3640888758189
Special recipe.	592.3640888758189

curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little
teapot at present.	1243.9574710764514

the beast.	1220.9543608928366
I can never forgive you for that.	907.3343252054079

stupid crowds.	1196.3022706333559
I am not on pleasure bent.	1512.1184347196586
BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.	977.5802836260193
But you must never tell.	1185.2415701191476
Not even Molly.	592.3640888758189
I have a most particular
reason.	1511.9772478444897

BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
tony buff shirt, shepherd’s plaid Saint Andrew’s cross scarftie, white
spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
bandolier and a grey billycock hat.)_ Do you remember a long long time,
years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?	1626.115442831283
MRS BREEN: _(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider
veil.)_ Leopardstown.	1039.4046473914384
BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown.	592.3640888758189
And Molly won seven shillings on a three
year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur
that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to
nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and
I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...	1642.1302799757068
MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser!
	763.4074507354627
MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!
	748.7481471511968
BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a
sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.	1163.1356025693613
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much
for her style.	1377.3216895184166
She was...	592.3640888758189
MRS BREEN: Too...	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: Yes.	592.3640888758189
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly
were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius
Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,
Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you
asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...	1409.87913770817
MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly.)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.	541.073411747957
_(She fades from his side.	836.0759459390589

In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
feet apart, pisses cowily.	1946.1041620331355
Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with
raucous humour.	1944.595286367157
An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in
maimed sodden playfight.)_
	1837.0593389670246
THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when
Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he
after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there
waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers.	1332.3091952095713
THE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates.)_ O jays!

lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_

They think it funny.	1196.279180360219
Anything but that.	946.3903946496885
Broad

I am
a man misunderstood.	1376.9048508321537

I live in Eccles street.	592.3640888758189

was a J.	852.3124343351099

Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was

Not by a long shot if I know it.	974.6179855623976
I
don’t see it, that’s all.	780.6281202053273
No born gentleman, no-one with the most
rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
loathsome conduct.	1884.5879287825935
One of those, my lord.	1376.6954252573667
A plagiarist.	592.3640888758189
A soapy sneak
masquerading as a literateur.	1616.5604771688738
It’s perfectly obvious that with the most
inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
suspicion.	2111.215661631356
The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout
the kingdom.	1830.38113906398
BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the
laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...	1042.7873756524978
BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You
funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don’t
think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.	1320.141490396337

I presume, my lord,
we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we?	1873.3836308998814
We are
considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this
jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.	1674.8789840172037
BLOOM: _(Indistinctly.)_ University of life.	513.0344801356961
Bad art.	592.3640888758189
BEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here
damning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my
maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.	1521.363941200976
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:

BLOOM: _(Bravely.)_ Overdrawn.	592.3640888758189
BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you
rotter! _(To the court.)_ Why, look at the man’s private life! Leading
a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil.	966.4865992237568
Not fit to be

SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?	974.430920280835
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one.	869.5665613131879
I bear a respectable
character and was four months in my last place.	1837.0055039018014
I was in a situation,
six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
owing to his carryings on.	1402.7539824613502
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	1196.473514760308
MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of
myself as poor as I am.	1106.3895077930088
BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white.	1477.1167820324179
I
gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.	1871.070298731737
Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.	1449.7986720223107
There’s a medium in all things.	1452.5735787769192
Play cricket.	592.3640888758189
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night
if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!
	1118.586597160878
FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of?	835.3424342748438
Did something happen?	946.4336915828404
MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your
honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for
a safety pin.	1445.1714320774531
He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a
result.	1216.5323616634703
And he interfered twict with my clothing.	1616.7699169754608
BLOOM: She counterassaulted.	592.3640888758189
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the
scouringbrush, so I had.	946.3197947611475
I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he
remarked: keep it quiet.	1344.9197620268058
_(General laughter.)_
	565.3183702526932
GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in
court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.	1009.034958626859
_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
a long unintelligible speech.	1823.8053606266399
They would hear what counsel had to say
in his stirring address to the grand jury.	1718.1264978319555
He was down and out but,
though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to
reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and
return to nature as a purely domestic animal.	1801.5608034293746
A sevenmonths’ child, he
had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.	1722.5584630843284
There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn
over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping
post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by
the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family.	1821.2968371280745
An
acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one
and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
ever...._
	1736.7045626400397
_(Renewed laughter.	592.3640888758189
He mumbles incoherently.	946.4336915828404

O’MOLLOY: _(In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
a voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor.	1539.2041687372264
We are not in a
beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice.	1504.150491186423
My
client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a
stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny.	2148.7392454152046
The trumped up
misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the
Pharaoh.	1700.41135876428
_Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at
carnally knowing.	988.5312135213541
Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of
by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated.	1542.0352187078843
I would
deal in especial with atavism.	1616.8260600451579
There have been cases of shipwreck and
somnambulism in my client’s family.	1637.0315968573743
If the accused could speak he could
a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between
the covers of a book.	1632.719294317209
He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
cobbler’s weak chest.	1945.989459031752
His submission is that he is of Mongolian
extraction and irresponsible for his actions.	1159.9568501436358
Not all there, in fact.	971.1295922705957
BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers,
apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about
him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead.	1866.206284252226
Then he hitches
his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes
the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine

The Mosaic code has
superseded the law of the jungle.	1110.3119886025604
I say it and I say it emphatically,
without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused
was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered
with.	1797.5369415853706
The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very
own daughter.	1905.4651637908137
_(Bloom takes J.	592.3640888758189
O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his
lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that
the hidden hand is again at its old game.	1447.9727986014334
When in doubt persecute
Bloom.	784.6724058811368
My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the
world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object
to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some
dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will
on her.	1786.563454010165
He wants to go straight.	1185.3237747904861
I regard him as the whitest man I
know.	1106.2846229877732
He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his
extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of
which will now be shown.	1330.1930871220327

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.)_ Arrest him, constable.	1589.316821924797
He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband
was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed
James Lovebirch.	1015.9899609679652
He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless
globes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command
performance of _La Cigale_.	942.4384275547607
I deeply inflamed him, he said.	630.470233224858
He made
improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m.	1472.353235959772
on
the following Thursday, Dunsink time.	549.1391256640227
He offered to send me through the
post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl
with the Three Pairs of Stays_.	973.48504426673
MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,
steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_
Also to me.	1447.8787836110605
Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person.	1140.2088849981976
Because
he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	1715.9502982906902
Subsequently
he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in
my honour.	1661.3240749270901
I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant
purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.	1793.2740575518949
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!

	592.3640888758189
SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.	784.6544341918932
MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed
himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his
fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing
my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon
garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or.	1723.0153263296968
He lauded almost
extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose
drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden
treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up.	1944.4458374388157
He
urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to
defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible
opportunity.	1740.73394441747
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me.	1608.2867777910226
Because he saw me on the polo
ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
Ireland.	929.7016178487926
My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady.	1275.816004786844
I have it still.	1196.2645766757194
It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard.	2102.1221548138633
He urged me
to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison.	1720.1482739337855
He
implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
vicious horsewhipping.	1823.5251356622073
MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.	592.3640888758189
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.	592.3640888758189

I’ll scourge
the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him.	1223.6960812319007

_(He squirms.)_
Again! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.	800.5876940180435
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I’ll make it hot for
you.	757.0280390875737
I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.	656.2935892797277

stripes on it!

Refined birching to stimulate the
circulation.	1334.6394987116398
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,
my fine fellow?	861.7551723820285
Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of
your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever
bargained for.	1690.8602761530933
You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into
fury.	1870.9880156490515
MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_
Make him smart, Hanna dear.	919.1173574311554
Give him ginger.	946.4336915828404
Thrash the mongrel within
an inch of his life.	1332.7681237200948

Vivisect him.	592.3640888758189

cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty.	1115.0960646692267
Forget, forgive.	592.3640888758189
Let me off this once.	1376.8495040184946
_(He offers the other cheek.)_
	1322.6872506937686
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don’t do so on any account, Mrs
Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
	968.8548134924616
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
violently.)_ I’ll do no such thing.	972.8765174123013
Pigdog and always was ever since he
was pupped! To dare address me! I’ll flog him black and blue in the
public streets.	1181.3220024675115
I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel.	1317.552027922032
He is a

DR MULLIGAN: _(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.)_ Dr
Bloom is bisexually abnormal.	1003.727616565764

private asylum for demented gentlemen.	1262.7603139802263
Born out of bedlock hereditary
epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust.	1946.6725587279204
Traces of
elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants.	1626.5231445227796
There are
marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism.	1616.8195509831073
Ambidexterity is also latent.	1196.2938424605543
He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in
consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth.	2047.745229721109
In consequence of a
family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to
be more sinned against than sinning.	1324.4267175977059
I have made a pervaginal
examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,
axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo

DR DIXON: _(Reads a bill of health.)_ Professor Bloom is a finished
example of the new womanly man.	1141.3500324222296
His moral nature is simple and lovable.	1616.8195510492678
Many have found him a dear man, a dear person.	1823.721880896324
He is a rather quaint
fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.	1832.2626508828246
He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the
court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which
clears up everything.	1445.4433217473734
He is practically a total abstainer and I can
affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,
cold dried grocer’s peas.	1616.8147856575983
He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish
manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday.	1306.1540243893269
He
was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree
reformatory.	960.642957371016

painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the
lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)_
	1757.2348957918196
THE MALE BRUTES: _(Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in
their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and
fro.)_ Good!

_(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.	1328.1691081039849

hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at
heels.	2168.8272923507834
Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the
halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head
sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom.	1532.256877833327

Kitty Ricketts, a bony
pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral
wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the

the mantelpiece.	1661.3076476665767

feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,

Marcello found it or made it.	1115.184079633694
The rite is the poet’s rest.	1323.5567594235529
It may be an
old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini._
It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round
David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s

his almightiness.	1378.6145423146522

coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of
gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I
should opine.	1631.442775406259
Backbone in front, so to say.	1107.0363633792422

suggest bunchiness of hip.	1522.920998124111

Observe
the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull.	1692.091942518592
What ho, she
bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.	1359.5168174061498

She is
coated with quite a considerable layer of fat.	1823.8329851008173
Obviously mammal in
weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
which leave nothing to be desired save compactness.	2211.08183607388

With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it
through with a crack.)_
	2002.5483762275553
KITTY: _(Chewing.)_ The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have
lovely ones.	1196.2203129776417
Full of the best liqueurs.	1039.887154445889
And the viceroy was there with
his lady.	1222.1756685086013
The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses.	1106.4080017898127
I’m giddy still.	1196.2980565823646
BLOOM: _(In Svengali’s fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic
forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance
towards the door.	1245.1971553501871
Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift
pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing
his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)_ Go, go, go, I conjure
you, whoever you are!
	1558.3952806540717
_(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.	1746.4898266168261
Bloom’s features relax.	1196.3022706333559
He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing
calmly.	1226.5420657125503
Zoe offers him chocolate.)_
	1376.861144421135
BLOOM: _(Solemnly.)_ Thanks.	592.3640888758189
ZOE: Do as you’re bid.	989.2475809739609
_(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)_
	1537.9866089357738
BLOOM: _(Takes the chocolate.)_ Aphrodisiac?	724.1070297587211
Tansy and pennyroyal.	946.4336915828404
Vanilla calms or?	946.4336915828404
Confused light confuses memory.	1196.3022706333559
Red influences lupus.	946.4336915828404
Colours affect women’s characters, any they have.	1548.0389238427224
This black makes me sad.	1376.8572642759873
Eat and be merry for tomorrow.	1177.981745609914
_(He eats.)_
Influence taste too, mauve.	841.8114424048898
But it is so long since I.	919.4386446629417
Seems new.	592.3640888758189
Must come.	592.3640888758189
Try truffles at
Andrews.	592.3640888758189
_(The door opens.	841.8114424048898
Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters.	1196.3022706333559
She is
dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
Minnie Hauck in_ Carmen.	1699.9033528158532
_On her left hand are wedding and keeper
rings.	1767.7494190405116
Her eyes are deeply carboned.	1376.8572642759873
She has a sprouting moustache.	1376.7982050458547
Her
olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted
nostrils.	1911.3573325345692
She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)_
	1616.8260600451579
BELLA: My word! I’m all of a mucksweat.	852.6329309225998
_(She glances round her at the couples.	1236.4928083571958
Then her eyes rest on Bloom
with hard insistence.	1106.4125218217307
Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated
faceneck and embonpoint.	1871.0726954518111
Her falcon eyes glitter.)_
	1376.8650244983396
THE FAN: _(Flirting quickly, then slowly.)_ Married, I see.	764.8733405781387
BLOOM: Yes.	592.3640888758189
Partly, I have mislaid...	841.8114424048898
THE FAN: _(Half opening, then closing.)_ And the missus is master.	1017.178780438169
Petticoat government.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Looks down with a sheepish grin.)_ That is so.	1063.7420197473193
THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.)_ Have you
forgotten me?	1141.5315633782945
BLOOM: Nes.	592.3640888758189
THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist.)_ Is me her was you dreamed
before?	1196.2843603980748
Was then she him you us since knew?	1700.0379447618134
Am all them and the same
now we?	1277.7836795373719
_(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)_
	1200.7593545629336
BLOOM: _(Wincing.)_ Powerful being.	592.3640888758189
In my eyes read that slumber which
women love.	1767.715482969603
THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ We have met.	643.030795245561
You are mine.	737.2943990675084
It is fate.	946.4336915828404
BLOOM: _(Cowed.)_ Exuberant female.	592.3640888758189
Enormously I desiderate your
domination.	1039.41860477134
I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young.	1373.7733779668613
I stand, so to
speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
the too late box of the general postoffice of human life.	1707.457823296156
The door and
window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
second according to the law of falling bodies.	1375.2359378463752
I have felt this instant
a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle.	1873.3547913600528
It runs in our family.	1376.8262206686227
Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it.	1747.7127262155716
He believed
in animal heat.	1376.8572642759873
A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat.	1700.0678893036218
Near the
end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
Athos, faithful after death.	928.7693215639058
A dog’s spittle as you probably...	1616.797412307284
_(He
winces.)_ Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING: _(Bagweighted, passes the door.)_ Mocking is catch.	783.6161379574125

Fit for a prince’s.	1185.0714947684198
Liver and kidney.	737.2874734175336
THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ All things end.	706.1578209475638
Be mine.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Undecided.)_ All now?	592.3640888758189
I should not have parted with my
talisman.	1700.0012633839629
Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my
time of life.	1663.4262523103744
Every phenomenon has a natural cause.	1512.0713808876822
THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly.)_ You may.	692.5044133719111
BLOOM: _(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.)_ We
are observed.	1133.3394029881642
THE FAN: _(Points downwards quickly.)_ You must.	692.5044133719111
BLOOM: _(With desire, with reluctance.)_ I can make a true black knot.	1196.2640469417697
Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
Kellett’s.	1253.676452281583
Experienced hand.	592.3640888758189
Every knot says a lot.	1376.9638028386137
Let me.	592.3640888758189
In
courtesy.	592.3640888758189
I knelt once before today.	1376.8650244983396
_(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.	1890.2704813671003
Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
draws out and in her laces.)_
	1901.4415242593423
BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly.)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my
love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up
crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies.	1528.675442201821
Even their wax model
Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
toe, as worn in Paris.	1449.0735046783625
THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide.	946.4336915828393
Feel my royal weight.	1196.2980565823646
BLOOM: _(Crosslacing.)_ Too tight?	592.3640888758189
THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.	812.7622700226613
BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
dance.	1093.9072781521543
Hook in wrong tache of her...	1020.8849060226231
person you mentioned.	2415.9675238541713
That night she met...	991.9684620356694
_(He knots the lace.	1039.4156756356842
Bella places her foot on the floor.	713.4970356313152
Bloom raises
his head.	663.810297414783
Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow.	1767.7453383246188
His eyes grow
dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_
	1871.0601405055213
BLOOM: _(Mumbles.)_ Awaiting your further orders we remain,
gentlemen,...	1122.249999788066
BELLO: _(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.)_ Hound of
dishonour!
	1253.4839849365544
BLOOM: _(Infatuated.)_ Empress!
	592.3640888758189
BELLO: _(His heavy cheekchops sagging.)_ Adorer of the adulterous rump!
	1063.7783080847817
BLOOM: _(Plaintively.)_ Hugeness!
	592.3640888758189
BELLO: Dungdevourer!
	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(With sinews semiflexed.)_ Magmagnificence!
	724.1084873131331
BELLO: Down! _(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.)_ Incline feet
forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall.	979.061673030961
You are falling.	946.4336915828404
On the hands down!
	676.4946992965891
BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)_
Truffles!
	1219.3816892381049
BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his
shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat,
sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck
deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it
in.)_ Footstool! Feel my entire weight.	1920.7559372104013
Bow, bondslave, before the
throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud
erectness.	1914.6587391095256
BELLO: _(Laughs loudly.)_ Holy smoke! You little know what’s in store
for you.	745.1078241341576
I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!
I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.	1048.4317070734435
Cheek me, I dare you.	784.6751929979457
If you do tremble in anticipation of heel
discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.	1905.4011944743409
_(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_
	1415.8503444072812
ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her.)_ She’s not here.	932.160696997275
BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes.)_ She’s not here.	649.9371412825989
FLORRY: _(Hiding her with her gown.)_ She didn’t mean it, Mr Bello.	820.0642989886998
She’ll be good, sir.	1185.2536953810993
KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello.	1039.4002838527945
Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.	1197.4494201549921
BELLO: _(Coaxingly.)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you,
darling, just to administer correction.	1147.5286707428309
Just a little heart to heart
talk, sweety.	1409.582969350386
_(Bloom puts out her timid head.)_ There’s a good girly
now.	1081.1763192139751
How’s that
tender behind?	1376.8671475072247
O, ever so gently, pet.	1185.2698488954957
Begin to get ready.	899.6386478296005
BLOOM: _(Fainting.)_ Don’t tear my...	841.8114424048898
BELLO: _(Savagely.)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the
hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like
the Nubian slave of old.	1325.4900541444113
You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you
remember me for the balance of your natural life.	1355.474133468453
_(His forehead veins
swollen, his face congested.)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback
every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat
hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter.	1329.3542501903567
_(He belches.)_ And suck
my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed
Victualler’s Gazette_.	656.707195115894
It will hurt you.	991.9789449784407
_(He twists her arm.	1039.4127464487399
Bloom
squeals, turning turtle.)_
	1376.8650244983396
BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse! Don’t!
	841.7988258577955
BELLO: _(Twisting.)_ Another!
	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Screams.)_ O, it’s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches
like mad!
	1147.8600252587662
Here, don’t keep me waiting,
damn you! _(He slaps her face.)_
	1160.0509970767148
BLOOM: _(Whimpers.)_ You’re after hitting me.	946.4336915828404
I’ll tell...	946.475045321757
BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.	821.225145582381
ZOE: Yes.	592.3640888758189
Walk on him! I will.	592.3640888758189
FLORRY: I will.	592.3640888758189
Don’t be greedy.	1196.2664120311244
KITTY: No, me.	592.3640888758189
Lend him to me.	494.957990763366
_(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
men’s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin
stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the
door.)_
	1699.8055805269028
MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously.)_ Can I help?	592.3640888758189
_(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_
	724.1084873131331
BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom’s upturned face, puffing
cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference
shares are at sixteen three quarters.	1133.5283709571622
Curse me for a fool that didn’t
buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about.	1193.3875035865183
Just my infernal luck,
curse it.	1334.6489013698113
And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.	638.0287670758661
_(He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom’s ear.)_ Where’s that
Goddamned cursed ashtray?	857.0563803831808
BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes.	1123.8223331325664
Pray for it as you never
prayed before.	1700.053773972276
_(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.)_ Here,
kiss that.	1322.6288940194986
_(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice.)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to
Banbury cross.	1301.4493162620518
I’ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes.	806.8358093531339
_(He bends
sideways and squeezes his mount’s testicles roughly, shouting.)_ Ho!
Off we pop! I’ll nurse you in proper fashion.	1344.9723617171824
_(He horserides
cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.)_ The lady goes a pace a pace
and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a
gallop a gallop a gallop.	1478.2948528989637
FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello.)_ Let me on him now.	714.8941879802569
You had enough.	946.4348492096655
I asked
before you.	899.5702439219506
ZOE: _(Pulling at Florry.)_ Me.	592.3640888758189
Are you not finished with him yet,
suckeress?	1700.0627163749286
BLOOM: _(Stifling.)_ Can’t.	592.3640888758189
BELLO: Well, I’m not.	624.666155982644
_(He holds in his breath.)_ Curse it.	946.3993036814402
This bung’s about burst.	1376.861144421135
_(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
his features, farts loudly.)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself.)_ Yes,
by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.	1035.5751414494316
BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him.)_ Not man.	987.6140489753172
_(He sniffs.)_
Woman.	592.3640888758189
BELLO: _(Stands up.)_ No more blow hot and cold.	890.3723960031429
What you longed for
has come to pass.	1409.6795291596734
Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a
thing under the yoke.	1946.026089652582
Now for your punishment frock.	1376.8321225995755
You will shed your
male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen?	1196.3022706333572
and don the shot silk
luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders.	2178.8701370955937
And quickly too!
	946.4336915828404
BLOOM: _(Shrinks.)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I
tiptouch it with my nails?	755.0139260425339
BELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be,
wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven
armpits.	1417.4656247543314
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin.	1548.0504610189805
You will be
laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with
whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,
while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in
nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things
stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for
Alice and nice scent for Alice.	2034.9660424383321
Alice will feel the pullpull.	1376.853384062898
Martha
and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing
but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind
you...	1838.822929517388
BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
male hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,
a small prank, in Holles street.	1485.824689052463
When we were hard up I washed them to
save the laundry bill.	1328.1344168700334
My own shirts I turned.	592.3640888758189
BELLO: _(Jeers.)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh?	1122.2528748785053
And showed
off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
your unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of
surrender, eh?	2106.657588062373
Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop
shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her
last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel,
eh?	1294.605862410945
BLOOM: Miriam.	592.3640888758189
BELLO: _(Guffaws.)_ Christ Almighty it’s too tickling, this! You were a
nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay
swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.	1116.9747276651583
P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus,
the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid
Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton.	767.449947737331
_(He guffaws
again.)_ Christ, wouldn’t it make a Siamese cat laugh?	839.3847231250788
BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working.)_ It was Gerald converted me
to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High
School play _Vice Versa_.	926.0374990890939
It was dear Gerald.	592.3640888758189
He got that kink,
fascinated by sister’s stays.	1767.761220007501
Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint
and gilds his eyelids.	1376.859204268318
Cult of the beautiful.	898.860388142974

THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
Black church.	1061.4561833295531
Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently
to the instrument in the callbox.	1406.8831530908678
By word and deed he frankly
encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an
unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	2148.8616426796566
In five public
conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner
to all strongmembered males.	2026.6490187713835
And by the offensively smelling vitriol
works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to
see if and what and how much he could see?	1829.011417684744
Did he not lie in bed, the
gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper
presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a
postal order?	1922.861620182454

fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
act, the hit of the century.	1572.069822765369
I was hidden in cheap pink paper that
smelt of rock oil.	1795.6636159635714
I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,

	592.3640888758189
THE NYMPH: I do.	592.3640888758189
You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
above your marriage couch.	2026.66260322667
Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
four places.	1570.0845371199673

Sleep reveals the

Steel wine is said to cure snoring.	1616.8353893356036
For the

It claims to afford a noiseless,
inoffensive vent.	1700.0619005235242

Frailty, thy name is

It wasn’t
her weight.	1376.8213628902768
She put on nine pounds
after weaning.	1616.8080579105247
It was a crack and want of glue.	1699.8289844091905
And that absurd
orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.	1823.8444105486474

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.	592.3640888758189
THE YEWS: _(Mingling their boughs.)_ Listen.	706.1578209475638
She is right, our
sister.	812.3033389390448
We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall.	592.3640888758189
We gave shade on languorous
summer days.	1452.724627491339
JOHN WYSE NOLAN: _(In the background, in Irish National Forester’s
uniform, doffs his plumed hat.)_ Prosper! Give shade on languorous
days, trees of Ireland!
	969.7295783061231
THE YEWS: _(Murmuring.)_ Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School
excursion?	592.3640888758197
Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?	1767.7605812837176
BLOOM: _(Scared.)_ High School of Poula?	592.3640888758189
Not in full possession
of faculties.	1512.1229110099925
Run over by tram.	991.9824392102742
THE ECHO: Sham!
	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
badge.)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy.	1853.95507545062
A little then sufficed, a
jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory,
the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice),
even a pricelist of their hosiery.	1957.523187997992
And then the heat.	991.8837015277843
There were
sunspots that summer.	1376.861144421135
End of school.	946.4336915828404
And tipsycake.	592.3640888758189
Halcyon days.	592.3640888758189
_(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a
clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_
	1020.9517787360223
THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again.	724.1084873131331
Hurray! _(They cheer.)_
	784.6746171349943
BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
snowballs, struggles to rise.)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark!
Let’s ring all the bells in Montague street.	984.0627141102372
_(He cheers feebly.)_
Hurray for the High School!
	681.772003416944
THE ECHO: Fool!
	592.3640888758189
THE YEWS: _(Rustling.)_ She is right, our sister.	693.670907031146
_(Whispered
kisses are heard in all the wood.	956.9337488799226
Faces of hamadryads peep out from the
boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)_ Who
profaned our silent shade?	1667.3661633295808
THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers.)_ There?	809.5736584060694
THE YEWS: _(Sweeping downward.)_ Sister, yes.	592.3640888758189
And on our virgin sward.	1376.8533842206493

THE NYMPH: _(With wide fingers.)_ O, infamy!
	692.5044133719111
BLOOM: I was precocious.	841.8114424048898
The fauna.	592.3640888758189
I sacrificed to the god of
the forest.	1059.1856247562741
The flowers that bloom in the spring.	927.1973991245478
It was pairing time.	991.9824392102742
Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon.	1056.7659966769156
Lotty Clarke,
flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
with poor papa’s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly.	1359.715675712319
She rolled
downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.	1438.3964818506347
She climbed their crooked tree and I...	1082.0154678135393
A saint couldn’t resist it.	1334.5718538005938
The
demon possessed me.	1196.2980565823661
Besides, who saw?	946.4336915828404
_(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with
humid nostrils through the foliage.)_
	1735.453521826384
STAGGERING BOB: (_Large teardrops rolling from his prominent eyes,
snivels._) Me.	1196.2529795868315
Me see.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I...	748.7545201171381
_(With pathos.)_ No girl would

Too ugly.	592.3640888758189
_(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,
plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)_
	1309.7870754084108
THE NANNYGOAT: _(Bleats.)_ Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and
gorsespine.)_ Regularly engaged.	1196.2962503202903
Circumstances alter cases.	946.4336915828404
_(He gazes
intently downwards on the water.)_ Thirtytwo head over heels per
second.	1020.5227124666325
Press nightmare.	592.3640888758189
Giddy Elijah.	592.3640888758189
Fall from cliff.	946.4336915828404
Sad end of
government printer’s clerk.	1616.850148686517
_(Through silversilent summer air the dummy
of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion’s Head
cliff into the purple waiting waters.)_
	1362.429073517067
THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!

_(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the_ Erin’s King
_sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards
the land.)_
	1211.4308302335544
COUNCILLOR NANNETTI: _(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,
his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.)_ When my country takes
her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let
my epitaph be written.	1345.9875789554897
I have...	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: Done.	592.3640888758189
THE NYMPH: _(Loftily.)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a
place and no hair there either.	1459.0890658358169
We are stonecold and pure.	1376.8650244983396
We eat
electric light.	1196.2980565823661
_(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing
her forefinger in her mouth.)_ Spoke to me.	1166.5403420209814
Heard from behind.	946.407019572209
How then
could you...?	899.5756520404766
BLOOM: _(Pawing the heather abjectly.)_ O, I have been a perfect pig.	933.1275775566176
Enemas too I have administered.	784.6746171349943
One third of a pint of quassia to which
add a tablespoonful of rocksalt.	1726.4585240229017
Up the fundament.	946.4336915828404
With Hamilton Long’s
syringe, the ladies’ friend.	1196.289627882401
THE NYMPH: In my presence.	784.6746171349943
The powderpuff.	592.3640888758189
_(She blushes and makes a
knee.)_ And the rest!
	988.157695060509
BLOOM: _(Dejected.)_ Yes.	592.3640888758189
_Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
altar where the back changes name.	1660.6420456309672
_(With sudden fervour.)_ For why
should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?	1407.592826217205
_(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the
treestems, cooeeing.)_
	1746.6356518550597
THE VOICE OF KITTY: _(In the thicket.)_ Show us one of them cushions.	742.8076948824244
THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.	592.3640888758189
_(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_
	1511.9446261241224
THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket.)_ Whew! Piping hot!
	605.6190869240236
THE VOICE OF ZOE: _(From the thicket.)_ Came from a hot place.	815.8794643980643
THE VOICE OF VIRAG: _(A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war
panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
beechmast and acorns.)_ Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
	1339.8314909844355
BLOOM: It overpowers me.	841.8114424048898
The warm impress of her warm form.	1616.5796379210763
Even to sit
where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
white sateen coatpans.	2097.94841210493
So womanly, full.	946.4336915828404
It fills me full.	1196.3022706333559
THE WATERFALL:

The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes.	592.3640888758189
No more desire.	946.4336915828404
_(She
reclines her head, sighing.)_ Only the ethereal.	1039.4093870980842
Where dreamy creamy
gull waves o’er the waters dull.	1025.0345482502457
_(Bloom half rises.	841.8114424048898
His back trouserbutton snaps.)_

THE BUTTON: Bip!

_(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)_
	1192.0517624524055
THE SLUTS:
	592.3640888758189
O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
	914.9451679374549
He didn’t know what to do,
	441.2420851929741
To keep it up,
	361.5994960689337
To keep it up.	361.5994960689337
BLOOM: _(Coldly.)_ You have broken the spell.	946.4336915828404
The last straw.	946.4336915828404
If there
were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices?	1837.08888897293
Shy
but willing like an ass pissing.	1616.813889523773
THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
aging and swaying.)_ Deciduously!
	1306.159776002992
THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her
habit.)_ Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! _(A large moist stain appears
on her robe.)_ Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment
of a pure woman.	1291.5942829429102
_(She clutches again in her robe.)_ Wait.	1017.9893570691836
Satan,
you’ll sing no more lovesongs.	1172.788135358843
_(She draws a
poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine,
strikes at his loins.)_ Nekum!
	1755.3490597519492
BLOOM: _(Starts up, seizes her hand.)_ Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o’ nine
lives! Fair play, madam.	824.8641287984768
No pruningknife.	592.3640888758189
The fox and the grapes, is
it?	1040.0223784083921
What do you lack with your barbed wire?	1474.4444106959288
Crucifix not thick enough?	1196.3022706333559
_(He clutches her veil.)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame
gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother
Alphonsus, eh Reynard?	1194.481051669818
THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.)_ Poli...!
	1528.8033298111718
BLOOM: _(Calls after her.)_ As if you didn’t get it on the double
yourselves.	967.8268927964218
No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you.	1474.259014363887
I tried it.	737.2909362695849
Your strength our weakness.	1196.3022706333559
What’s our studfee?	1196.2938424605543
What will you pay on
the nail?	1616.4967642523936
You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read.	841.8114424048898
_(The fleeing
nymph raises a keen.)_ Eh?	1106.4267204841644
I have sixteen years of black slave labour
behind me.	1627.2970286691736
And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow,
eh?	1871.0605610592595
Fool someone else, not me.	1185.27318902619
_(He sniffs.)_ Rut.	592.3640888758189
_(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)_
	687.1391801290711
BELLA: You’ll know me the next time.	685.1461425950092
BLOOM: _(Composed, regards her.) Passée._ Mutton dressed as lamb.	764.8733405781387
Long
in the tooth and superfluous hair.	1617.3079200025888
A raw onion the last thing at night
would benefit your complexion.	1911.2852971033672
And take some double chin drill.	1512.1317147529485
I’m not a triple screw
propeller.	1323.67528359623
BELLA: _(Contemptuously.)_ You’re not game, in fact.	872.9344380805367
_(Her sowcunt
barks.)_ Fbhracht!
	748.7545201171381
BLOOM: _(Contemptuously.)_ Clean your nailless middle finger first,
your bully’s cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb.	1584.6774978514804
Take a handful
of hay and wipe yourself.	1393.1624989154047
BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
	946.4007630437021
BELLA: _(Turns to the piano.)_ Which of you was playing the dead march
from _Saul?_
	883.8980621098693
ZOE: Me.	592.3640888758189
Mind your cornflowers.	946.4336915828404
_(She darts to the piano and bangs
chords on it with crossed arms.)_ The cat’s ramble through the slag.	1417.6455122470038
_(She glances back.)_ Eh?	748.7545201171381
Who’s making love to my sweeties?	1305.2283386590866
_(She darts
back to the table.)_ What’s yours is mine and what’s mine is my own.	1021.2694039434825
_(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper.	1469.8133411941396
Bloom
approaches Zoe.)_
	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Gently.)_ Give me back that potato, will you?	910.9130488567408
ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.	1511.7851978872832
Give a thing and take it back
	1287.7824677725737
You’ll say you don’t know
	632.9268323292166
God’ll send you down below.	1334.633229893309
BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it.	1146.4571536664878
I should like to have it.	903.32001211518
STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.	974.3048925243627
ZOE: Here.	592.3640888758189
_(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.)_ Those that hides
knows where to find.	1309.724007979311
BELLA: _(Frowns.)_ Here.	592.3640888758189
And don’t you
smash that piano.	1026.6428018389686
_(She goes to the pianola.	624.748835801505
Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking
out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_
	1201.059945652944
STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness.)_ This silken purse I made out
of the sow’s ear of the public.	835.2358144988755
Madam, excuse me.	556.5777625845743
If you allow me.	843.0432662507601
_(He
indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.)_ We are all in the same sweepstake,
Kinch and Lynch.	625.7528220862987
_Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état_.	1616.8260600451579
LYNCH: _(Calls from the hearth.)_ Dedalus! Give her your blessing for
me.	863.1621859768816
STEPHEN: _(Hands Bella a coin.)_ Gold.	706.1516019963296
She has it.	593.5089631274839
BELLA: _(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and
Kitty.)_ Do you want three girls?	885.1075818761109
It’s ten shillings here.	1376.8853765245601
STEPHEN: _(Delightedly.)_ A hundred thousand apologies.	841.809959736356
_(He fumbles
again and takes out and hands her two crowns.)_ Permit, _brevi manu_,
my sight is somewhat troubled.	1560.1006986841965
_(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
himself in monosyllables.	966.130046790471
Zoe bends over the table.	723.980972276981
Kitty leans over
Zoe’s neck.	660.8681600265427
Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty’s waist,
adds his head to the group.)_
	1354.2214328401883
FLORRY: _(Strives heavily to rise.)_ Ow! My foot’s asleep.	889.1508763262111
_(She limps
over to the table.	478.42449728446684
Bloom approaches.)_
	946.4336915828404
BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: _(Chattering and squabbling.)_ The
gentleman...	665.9844510953995
ten shillings...	352.42948694313
paying for the three...	2414.84565528363

are you staying the night or a short
time?...	1276.1537354024474
who did?...	1661.83159138419
you’re a liar, excuse me...	829.9373358144422
the gentleman paid
down like a gentleman...	1235.638840131796
it’s long after eleven.	1001.9823248463387
STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.)_ No
bottles! What, eleven?	988.7741842078404
A riddle!
	592.3640888758189
ZOE: _(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
top of her stocking.)_ Hard earned on the flat of my back.	1305.568923057178
LYNCH: _(Lifting Kitty from the table.)_ Come!
	580.4307215926119
KITTY: Wait.	592.3640888758189
_(She clutches the two crowns.)_
	1188.3582348009447
FLORRY: And me?	592.3640888758189
LYNCH: Hoopla!
	592.3640888758189
_(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)_
	1247.0185769914776
The fox crew, the cocks flew,
	1512.138816961438
The bells in heaven
	699.0476846265252
Were striking eleven.	647.1903747676978
’Tis time for her poor soul
	1177.9203358085163
To get out of heaven.	720.215632606517
BLOOM: _(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and
Florry.)_ So.	826.4316626303739
Allow me.	592.3640888758189
_(He takes up the poundnote.)_ Three times ten.	1039.3592418382152
We’re square.	946.4336915828404

THE MOTHER: _(With smouldering eyes.)_ Repent! O, the fire of hell!
	813.5415475292573
STEPHEN: _(Panting.)_ His noncorrosive sublimate! The corpsechewer! Raw
head and bloody bones.	719.3256132252619
THE MOTHER: _(Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen
breath.)_ Beware! _(She raises her blackened withered right arm slowly
towards Stephen’s breast with outstretched finger.)_ Beware God’s hand!
_(A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws
in Stephen’s heart.)_
	1308.386089938006
STEPHEN: _(Strangled with rage.)_ Shite! _(His features grow drawn and
grey and old.)_
	1098.352808727249
BLOOM: _(At the window.)_ What?	724.1095764790601
STEPHEN: _Ah non, par exemple!_ The intellectual imagination! With me
all or not at all.	767.0567985186773
_Non serviam!_
	946.4336915828404
FLORRY: Give him some cold water.	1196.2910331399253
_(She rushes out.)_
	1039.4068879209726
THE MOTHER: _(Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.)_ O Sacred
Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O Divine Sacred
Heart!
	766.3910858844067
STEPHEN: No! No! No! Break my spirit, all of you, if you can! I’ll
bring you all to heel!
	1071.0951896460156
THE MOTHER: _(In the agony of her deathrattle.)_ Have mercy on Stephen,
Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with
love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.	1032.8180548435448
STEPHEN: _Nothung!_
	592.3640888758189
_(He lifts his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the
chandelier.	1480.4698583705208

darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)_

_(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back
stark, beats the ground and flies from the room, past the whores at the
door.)_
	1479.0306708529538
_(The two whores rush to the halldoor.	1298.0703957333026

	1196.3022706333559
THE WHORES: _(Jammed in the doorway, pointing.)_ Down there.	733.2987326919914
ZOE: _(Pointing.)_ There.	592.3640888758189
There’s something up.	1196.2938424605543
BELLA: Who pays for the lamp?	872.865602176133
_(She seizes Bloom’s coattail.)_ Here,
you were with him.	774.071763181337
The lamp’s broken.	991.9824392102742
BLOOM: _(Rushes to the hall, rushes back.)_ What lamp, woman?	999.3700944569086
A WHORE: He tore his coat.	749.4759773125505
BELLA: _(Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.)_ Who’s to pay
for that?	1115.6684878210353
Ten shillings.	592.3640888758189
You’re a witness.	991.9474940826929
BLOOM: _(Snatches up Stephen’s ashplant.)_ Me?	692.5033291971034
Ten shillings?	592.3640888758189
Haven’t
you lifted enough off him?	1452.8139935280112
Didn’t he...?	593.5096891166162
BELLA: _(Loudly.)_ Here, none of your tall talk.	886.3362515679985
This isn’t a brothel.	1185.3103659711733
A ten shilling house.	1196.2980565823646
BLOOM: _(His head under the lamp, pulls the chain.	1185.1898131865532
Pulling, the gasjet
lights up a crushed mauve purple shade.	1823.7829094504564
He raises the ashplant.)_ Only
the chimney’s broken.	1109.9464476910089

BELLA: _(Shrinks back and screams.)_ Jesus! Don’t!
	784.6583646599297
BLOOM: _(Warding off a blow.)_ To show you how he hit the paper.	1086.3183161168363
There’s not sixpenceworth of damage done.	1616.7557921118944
Ten shillings!
	592.3640888758189
BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?	1225.7572734225919
BLOOM: O, I know.	592.3640888758189
Patrons of your establishment.	1196.137730830592
Gentlemen that pay the rent.	1185.2723189128167
_(He makes
a masonic sign.)_ Know what I mean?	869.1359211809565
Nephew of the vicechancellor.	1195.3612378582463
You

Are you my commander here or?	1512.1068563113524
Where is
he?	416.2664053616629
I’ll charge him! Disgrace him, I will! _(She shouts.)_ Zoe! Zoe!
	654.9319539726961
BLOOM: _(Urgently.)_ And if it were your own son in Oxford?	960.2102647922759
_(Warningly.)_ I know.	592.3640888758189
BELLA: _(Almost speechless.)_ Who are.	592.3640888758189
ZOE: _(In the doorway.)_ There’s a row on.	922.5326957012279
BLOOM: What?	592.3640888758189
_(He throws a shilling on the table and starts.)_
That’s for the chimney.	1087.4461182731786
I need mountain air.	1196.3022706333559
The whores point.	946.4336915828404
Florry follows,
spilling water from her tilted tumbler.	1700.003463961382
On the doorstep all the whores
clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared
off.	1751.5622685208484
From the left arrives a jingling hackney car.	1700.025865807554
It slows to in front
of the house.	619.0789383024934
Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is
about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers.	1374.328606871538
He averts his
face.	698.1057424648965
Bella from within the hall urges on her whores.	1626.4289720802349
They blow
ickylickysticky yumyum kisses.	1376.8650244983396
Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly
lewd smile.	1425.518693929332
Zoe and Kitty
still point right.	946.4336915828393
Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph’s hood
and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.	1916.0619557562454
Incog Haroun
al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the
railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn
envelopes drenched in aniseed.	1744.3966920590733
The ashplant marks his stride.	1185.2823396500055
A pack of
bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in
tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking
up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away,
throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail.	1786.6693218746914
He
walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back.	1700.070883610277
He is pelted with

What’s up?	737.2849123494218
Soldier and civilian.	946.4336915828404
CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to
do—you know, and the young man run up behind me.	1253.230795868207
But I’m faithful to

PRIVATE CARR: _(His cap awry, advances to Stephen.)_ Say, how would it
be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?	1093.5512149558479
Very unpleasant.	592.3640888758189

	1426.0980581230044
BLOOM: _(Elbowing through the crowd, plucks Stephen’s sleeve
vigorously.)_ Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.	1070.8951175657128
STEPHEN: _(Turns.)_ Eh?	592.3640888758189
_(He disengages himself.)_ Why should I not
speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate
orange?	1420.62239132652
Retaining the perpendicular.	946.4336915828404

STEPHEN: _(Laughs emptily.)_ My centre of gravity is displaced.	987.6193860923375
I have
forgotten the trick.	1040.6271785731474
Let us sit down somewhere and discuss.	1452.7135956966713
Struggle
for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably
the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration.	1392.714787491128
_(He taps
his brow.)_ But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.	909.1229098564355
BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said?	630.7261215320148
He’s a professor
out of the college.	904.6913416856364
CUNTY KATE: I did.	592.3640888758189
I heard that.	946.4203558902273
BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
phraseology.	1344.9660677923962
CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes.	592.3640888758189
And at the same time with such apposite
trenchancy.	931.7986503624612
PRIVATE CARR: _(Pulls himself free and comes forward.)_ What’s that
you’re saying about my king?	1187.5817895658377
_(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway.	913.7866699114908
He wears a white jersey on
which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of
Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner’s and
Probyn’s horse, Lincoln’s Inn bencher and ancient and honourable
artillery company of Massachusetts.	990.8638572446667

_In his left hand he holds a plasterer’s
bucket on which is printed_ Défense d’uriner.	1079.9508038222652
_A roar of welcome greets
him.)_
	1287.7820615526095
EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.)_ Peace,
perfect peace.	841.8114424048908
For identification, bucket in my hand.	1033.9142600404718
Cheerio, boys.	592.3640888758189
_(He turns to his subjects.)_ We have come here to witness a clean
straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck.	1655.4086276214125

and Lynch.	623.0513598099168
General applause.	592.3640888758189
Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket
graciously in acknowledgment.)_
	1376.8475636059923
PRIVATE CARR: _(To Stephen.)_ Say it again.	610.0982301531521
STEPHEN: _(Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.)_ I understand your
point of view though I have no king myself for the moment.	1091.2199708031324
This is the
age of patent medicines.	1156.9226614924394
A discussion is difficult down here.	1334.633230087107
But this
is the point.	692.5183053812312
You die for your country.	1020.3148771556894
_(He places his arm on
Private Carr’s sleeve.)_ Not that I wish it for you.	737.5052533396981
But I say: Let my
country die for me.	846.2980423260537
Up to the present it has done so.	1547.4049734505322
I didn’t want it
to die.	895.9049429161273
Damn death.	592.3640888758189
Long live life!
	946.4336915828404
EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and
with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent
face.)_
	1277.509716671322
My methods are new and are causing surprise.	1700.0589062935621
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.	1112.7214285001817
STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! _(He falls back a pace.)_ Come somewhere
and we’ll...	957.9493744950255
What was that girl saying?...	1376.7844611155604
PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers.	854.7954186994103
Stick one
into Jerry.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(To the privates, softly.)_ He doesn’t know what he’s saying.	876.9565689840623
Taken a little more than is good for him.	1068.5951088551412
Greeneyed monster.	592.3640888758189
I know him.	647.1751766753763
He’s a gentleman, a poet.	1103.4999546032261
It’s all right.	348.34396156533904
STEPHEN: _(Nods, smiling and laughing.)_ Gentleman, patriot, scholar

worse.	1210.6731368997948
Eh, what?	592.3640888758189
FIRST WATCH: _(Laughs.)_ I suppose so.	706.1553334363512
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Nudges the second watch.)_ Come and wipe your name
off the slate.	990.9828956682842
What, eh, do you follow me?	662.9524441948922
SECOND WATCH: _(Genially.)_ Ah, sure we were too.	903.0873138516774
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Winking.)_ Boys will be boys.	744.8978232551824
I’ve a car round there.	1334.6058374796655
SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher.	592.3640888758189
Good night.	592.3640888758189
CORNY KELLEHER: I’ll see to that.	885.8682475600048
Thank you.	592.3640888758189
_(He mumbles confidentially.)_ We don’t
want any scandal, you understand.	903.5138206813415
Father is a wellknown highly
respected citizen.	1373.6349790364957
Just a little wild oats, you understand.	1373.669811352787
FIRST WATCH: O.	592.3640888758189
I understand, sir.	946.4336915828404
SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.	545.8850344733899
FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to
report it at the station.	1113.1208136414518
BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly.)_ Naturally.	592.3640888758189
Quite right.	592.3640888758189
Only your bounden
duty.	1196.3022706333559
SECOND WATCH: It’s our duty.	946.4292463762724
CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.	784.6746171349943
THE WATCH: _(Saluting together.)_ Night, gentlemen.	592.3640888758189
_(They move off
with slow heavy tread.)_
	1512.1098892743282
BLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene.	778.7499686249379
You have a
car?...	1196.147371155197
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
the car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were
standing fizz in Jammet’s.	1261.035198896658
Like princes, faith.	946.4336915828404
One of them lost two
quid on the race.	1362.5114748440085
Drowning his grief.	946.4336915828404
And were on for a go with the
jolly girls.	1509.2379510050434
So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.	1156.716443722853
BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...	807.659613503659
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the
mots.	1134.242425518236
No, by God, says I.	592.3640888758189
Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.	1548.065665541282
_(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we
have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me?	909.5443824276543
Hah, hah, hah!
	946.4292464214541
BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he! Yes.	681.7712645128915
Matter of fact I was just
visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor
fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together
and I was just making my way home...	1239.2177598359958
THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
	592.3640888758189
_(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.	841.8114424048898
Will I give him a lift home?	972.1962896145398
Where does he hang out?	1376.833981978199
Somewhere in
Cabra, what?	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.	1048.3461553800212
_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars.	1082.3988550140405
Corny Kelleher, asquint,
drawls at the horse.	1188.2237378924065
Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_
	1334.6457671910655
Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.	1339.8344039317367
BLOOM: No, no, no.	544.1338753854511
I have his money and his hat here and stick.	1823.674173618398
CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it.	896.9334759723303
No bones broken.	946.4336915828404
Well,
I’ll shove along.	1039.4156756356856
_(He laughs.)_ I’ve a rendezvous in the morning.	750.7735071467143
Burying the dead.	507.1826290744173
Safe home!
	592.3640888758189
THE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: Good night.	592.3640888758189
I’ll just wait and take him along in a few...	1686.417612089492
_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	1353.2351217896262
The horse
harness jingles.)_
	1376.8650244983396
CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.	809.573356936413
BLOOM: Night.	592.3640888758189
_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	1538.1974163239158
The
car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	1767.738438794319
Corny Kelleher on the
sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight.	1184.7680364559121
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	1409.727112630022
With thumb
and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	1371.0167718469575
With a slow nod Bloom
conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	1141.5406444498497
The car
jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	1040.1039863136114
Corny
Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	805.3008432910921
Bloom with his hand
assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.	843.1259680457928
The tinkling
hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo
lay.	1946.0540702184248
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings,
and ashplant, stands irresolute.	1220.5114990737336
Then he bends to him and shakes him by
the shoulder.)_
	1260.8458189893418
BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!
_(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call.	906.4992088584792
_(He bends
again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
form.)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer.	1096.6178105141146
He calls again.)_ Stephen!
	675.4917508349117
STEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who?	592.3640888758189
Black panther.	592.3640888758189
_(He sighs and
stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)_
	1746.6545846009014
Fergus now
	592.3640888758189
And pierce...	592.3640888758189
wood’s woven shade?...	2415.9788711002393
_(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_
	1421.2564123678133
BLOOM: Poetry.	592.3640888758189
Well educated.	592.3640888758189
_(He bends again and undoes the
buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat.)_ To breathe.	988.7675678190355
_(He brushes the
woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers.)_ One
pound seven.	1196.2882225788355
Not hurt anyhow.	946.4336915828404
_(He listens.)_ What?	592.3640888758189
STEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_
	592.3640888758189
the woods

_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.	1699.9736646667113
Bloom,
holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect.	1164.0967065780947
A dog barks in the
distance.	1335.1090181433829
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.	1626.3099089051495
He looks
down on Stephen’s face and form.)_
	1067.3608741200007
BLOOM: _(Communes with the night.)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.	972.2553941762003
In the shady wood.	1196.3022706333559
The deep white breast.	991.9789449784407

that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,

where the tide ebbs...	1561.9507109246254
and flows
...	2420.9374298644125
_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips
in the attitude of secret master.	1693.0594644199327
Against the dark wall a figure
appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed
in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a
book in his hand.	1564.2045646119293
BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy!
	724.1084873131331
RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading,
kissing, smiling.	1102.7026999270288
He has a delicate mauve face.	1512.070561202372
On his suit he has
diamond and ruby buttons.	1767.7062367643848
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory
cane with a violet bowknot.	1608.2683633514885
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat
pocket.)_
	1068.1285637796288
Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	1368.1405482510206
His
(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a
bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry
water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit
upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the
cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt
bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk
and soda or a mineral.	1592.732757231606
But how to get there was the rub.	1015.9448344100496
For the nonce
he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon
him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and
means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	1726.9534750670705
So far as he could see he
was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly
advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in
their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,
always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.	1583.5869268180068
Accordingly
after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having
forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had
done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together
along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and
the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.	1376.8778634531527
But
as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by
emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,
twice.	1504.6703867838798
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
which they accordingly did.	1875.839019098595
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the
Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
light of the mischance.	1302.1330981808815
So as neither of them were particularly pressed
for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they
dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a
fare or a jarvey.	1920.4409088614163
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s
sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his
companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of
some little while back.	1499.5022820699069
They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of
course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the
backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the
Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its
C division police station.	1521.2178654958373
Between this point and the high at present
unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot
place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as
his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of
James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,
the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities
of the public the primary and most indispensable.	1405.1938770950997
Bread, the staff of
life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the
baker’s it is said.	1376.9576601920833
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in
complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact
disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of
nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely
permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of
the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age
particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence
of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as
even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if
you didn’t look out.	1908.3522499587405
Highly providential was the appearance on the
scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for
that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might
have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,
failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day
before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant
to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got
bruited about.	1352.2233239421353
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those
policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in
the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or
two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole
through a ten gallon pot.	1418.7942768672744
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet
parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law
were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to
protect the upper classes.	1547.00205911642
Another thing he commented on was equipping
soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off
at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians
should by any chance they fall out over anything.	2205.139257294705
You frittered away
your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character
besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the
_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	1912.4307168798862
into the bargain and the
greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the
much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing
aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch
believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably
drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of
your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	2096.4562823662327
Most of all he
commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
_confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his
brother medicos under all the circs.	1798.832876164836
—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
whatsoever of any kind.	1287.2382907028455
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a
brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one
attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	1390.0353223271607
Stephen of his own accord
stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren
cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just
make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom
of the sentrybox.	1642.1845442835827
He began to remember that this had happened or had
been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small
effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
_quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.	1759.8256179028604
To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	1606.0644318772784
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	592.3640888758189
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
saluted again, calling:
	1905.192532274672
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
compliment.	1795.7538010363057
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
though not funkyish in the least.	1906.9866189904062
Though unusual in the Dublin area he
knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames
embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	1904.9808744256975
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s
breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	1617.5896653729862
Lord John Corley some called him
and his genealogy came about in this wise.	1442.8102666882196
He was the eldest son of
inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a
certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.	999.8797409489571
His
grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of
a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	1093.4107084013797
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had
enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	1729.731187136173
This
therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though
dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	1406.8212050615057
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	1215.7370277918717
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.	1435.3967742675702
His friends
had all deserted him.	1512.1317147529485
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of
other uncalledfor expressions.	1163.2752725818082
He was out of a job and implored of
Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something,
anything at all, to do.	1046.5260329621299
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the
washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they
were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete
fabrication from start to finish.	1554.6078930725184
Anyhow he was all in.	1020.4396456639429
—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
I’m on the rocks.	1265.4666631584391
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	1242.0293449165706
Mr Garrett Deasy.	592.3640888758189
Try it.	592.3640888758189
You
may mention my name.	1040.6226220593946
—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man.	1133.1004946744902
I was
never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	1606.4768067228226
I got stuck
twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	1748.0492660295718
—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	1196.2723673688183
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
tart off the street.	1394.0221604919686
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	1214.4698703917838
He was starving too though he
hadn’t said a word about it.	1266.3872310434954
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he
knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was
hardly deserving of much credence.	1554.60312510297
However _haud ignarus malorum
miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially
as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the
month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of
fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	1339.6479847864039
But the cream
of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was
living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	1374.7511283940548
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of
finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a
bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get
sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his
chagrin, he found his cash missing.	1841.0989770852755
A few broken biscuits were all the
result of his investigation.	1618.529384456062
He tried his hardest to recollect for the
moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in
that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse
in fact.	1605.0580216959656
About biscuits he dimly
remembered.	1376.8650244983396
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did
he buy.	1873.3718341945332
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in
the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	1682.593526261746
—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	885.1534237904042
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	788.1630805283405
Stephen anyhow lent him
one of them.	886.1978825894201
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.	816.2320463554586
I’ll pay you back one
time.	1452.709051476852
Who’s that with you?	926.8677755670922
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	771.820228105122
You might put in a good
word for us to get me taken on there.	1408.7427855341189
I’d carry a sandwichboard only
the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three
weeks, man.	1842.4948082495919
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the
Carl Rosa.	1239.708897915057
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as
a crossing sweeper.	1223.655611962717
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,
bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with
O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.	1097.6106857108641
Anyhow he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	1727.1836804521824
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while Dublin slept.	1473.9006812706007
He threw an odd eye at the same
time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired
interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though
where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the
remotest idea when.	1410.4504766993562
Being a levelheaded individual who could give
points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on
his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally
testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	2024.7058650055328
In any case he
had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that
hour of the night or morning.	1420.6465092086773
Pretty thick that was certainly.	1376.9358716527693
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite.	1323.9066641665102
Alluding to the encounter he
said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
	930.3950952285968
—He is down on his luck.	903.3147728850357
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	1255.130362798546
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:
	1414.8256308630307
—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	1352.1314482548598
Now you mention it
his face was familiar to me.	1281.4044426789112
But, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	1376.4378425359657
—Half a crown, Stephen responded.	592.3640888758189
I daresay he needs it to sleep
somewhere.	1700.0671324820398
—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
invariably does.	1243.0891901468208
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
to his deeds.	1524.999360865785
But, talking about things in general, where, added he
with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	1690.498668426741
Walking to Sandycove is out of
the question.	525.7677337276018
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what
occurred at Westland Row station.	1296.3051713550813
Simply fag out there for nothing.	1197.4423082674302
I
don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
did you leave your father’s house?	1428.769647293792
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.	885.1534237904042
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday.	1620.502937779649
Where does he live at present?	1334.601885696941
I gathered in the course of
conversation that he had moved.	977.7884253789437
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	837.9130923359461
—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	1102.2852945147013
He takes great
pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	1333.599854325549
You could go back perhaps, he
hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
which they did.	1488.1733803204625
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on
the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
something like that.	1591.256415918974
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust
in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,
Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your
shoes.	1390.8235961817472
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all
probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	1382.8415033000451
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.	895.5830099948599
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a
versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
jealousy, pure and simple.	1856.4038256890613
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
your brains, he ventured to throw out.	1759.9946038082242
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
himself allowed matters to more or less.	1826.6748433170717
Grinding poverty did have that
effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities
though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both
ends meet.	1988.603454714327
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car
round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were
getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a
particularly animated way, there being some little differences between
the parties.	1969.9019418927378
—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	1106.4301849033661
Culo rotto!_
	946.4336915828404
_—Intendiamoci.	592.3640888758189
Mezzo sovrano più..._
	991.9824392102742
_—Dice lui, però!_
	1039.41860477134
_—Mezzo._
	592.3640888758189
_—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_
	784.6746171349943
Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious
wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	1537.7259739184976
A few
moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet
corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous
collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the
genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified
by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked
curiosity.	2124.987587336425
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	1364.8685116581953
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
these commodities quietly.	1946.0913718214817
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or
whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous
individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still
stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention
to the floor.	2116.663352799579
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:
	1815.8168417168877
—A beautiful language.	946.4336915828404
I mean for singing purposes.	1376.861144421135
Why do you not
write your poetry in that language?	1509.9565771874106
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious
and full.	1196.2727697180587
Voglio._
	592.3640888758189
Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
from lassitude generally, replied:
	1959.4021743407643
—To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	1283.1284249177509
They were haggling over money.	1376.8650244983396
—Is that so?	489.3841106234864
Mr Bloom asked.	592.3640888758189
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that
surrounds it.	2095.8995681982383
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a
boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the
table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	1569.313975401023
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to
have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	1247.9596534139841
For
which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he
did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	1628.0536772138646
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
like names.	1245.4309929858052
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	592.3640888758189
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	592.3640888758189
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	946.4270237130448
What’s in a name?	571.6857845790905
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	637.1286124226406
Of course.	592.3640888758189
Our name
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	1911.3231754899032
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
by asking:
	1647.5514579411515
—And what might your name be?	1512.1113322647375
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
quarter, answered:
	1413.6047445797756
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
Hollands and water.	1587.915412253339
—You know Simon Dedalus?	592.3640888758189
he asked at length.	1181.301483209656
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.	795.3090591065873
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
eavesdropping too.	1429.5343710534275
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
way and nodding.	1524.3283053592231
All Irish.	592.3640888758189
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	592.3640888758189
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when
the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the
shelter with the remark:
	1442.685632143375
—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
shoulder.	1544.457880942962
The lefthand dead shot.	1196.3022706333559
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	1916.566028982793
—Bottles out there, say.	1196.268556242319
Fifty yards measured.	946.4336915828404
Eggs on the bottles.	1195.8745420096973
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	789.4172179880118
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	1584.8504888226776
Then
he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the
night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	1909.7887719928776
—Pom! he then shouted once.	1376.8378625310465
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,
there being still a further egg.	1976.4068002915085
—Pom! he shouted twice.	1196.2980565823646
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
bloodthirstily:
	1823.855445171015
_—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
	946.4292463762724
Never missed nor he never will._
	1452.6827313306185
A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like
asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
Bisley.	1382.608209050721
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.	828.4157708170934
—Long ago?	592.3640888758189
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	1322.6578404480306
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	1749.2899809407086
He
toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus.	747.631123655825
I seen him do that
in Stockholm.	1081.991436581298
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	592.3640888758189
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.	1452.6513716437917
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	592.3640888758189
Know where that is?	638.3310473991457
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	592.3640888758189
—That’s right, the sailor said.	818.8202073195882
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	592.3640888758189
That’s
where I hails from.	660.8681600265427
I belongs there.	946.4336915828404
That’s where I hails from.	660.8681600265427
My
little woman’s down there.	997.7206565515058
She’s waiting for me, I know.	714.5915051618302
_For England,
home and beauty_.	1039.4076507908017
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years
now, sailing about.	1426.6153893751562
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a
rainy night with a blind moon.	1614.3826996748817
Across the world for a wife.	692.0596400027554
Quite a
number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember
Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way
of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	1033.8594190152094
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
absentee.	1782.0945606372745
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
his better half, wrecked in his affections.	1785.339696191784
You little expected me but
I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	1438.4149392554862
There she sits, a grasswidow,
at the selfsame fireside.	1767.5648286620867
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
deep.	1569.8977494247144
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
onions.	1023.9912829385513
No chair for father.	1196.3022706333559
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on
her knee, _post mortem_ child.	1406.893299502992
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	1511.676135477632
Grin and bear it.	1196.2980565823661
I
remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	1293.4683276928945
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
of the jarvies with the request:
	1150.9497537770405
—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	1636.7380498401108
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die
of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object
was passed from hand to hand.	2150.497574768469
—Thank you, the sailor said.	828.3838217970289
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
stammers, proceeded:
	2002.9859473129604
—We come up this morning eleven o’clock.	1427.132587470531
The threemaster _Rosevean_
from Bridgwater with bricks.	650.6169669697325
I shipped to get over.	1376.9155894900446
Paid off this
afternoon.	1196.2991540178136
There’s my discharge.	1196.2665368305422
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	1951.003014793187
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
leaning on the counter.	1257.6132205099204
—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated
a bit since I first joined on.	1240.7401146010377
I was in the Red Sea.	466.2823170237356
I was in China and
North America and South America.	592.3640888758197
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	1616.8228055439395
I
seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	1376.8650244983396
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
scuttled a ship.	987.5939499888672
I seen Russia.	592.3640888758189
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	592.3640888758189
That’s how the
Russians prays.	748.7510033694363
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.	1263.0621856085497
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	1513.0986936190907
I seen queer
things too, ups and downs.	1700.0589062326908
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
anchor same as I chew that quid.	1557.01580323585
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
teeth, bit ferociously:
	1400.5186292701017
—Khaan! Like that.	592.3640888758189
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
the livers of horses.	1322.3360588186931
Look here.	592.3640888758189
Here they are.	507.1236870126373
A friend of mine sent
me.	1197.4353908645917
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed
to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	1426.806003842261
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	946.4228049096633
Beni, Bolivia._
	592.3640888758189
All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	1970.5548095327354
—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	1700.0416306993748
Stomachs like
breadgraters.	946.4336915828404
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more
children.	1522.6593923751423
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver
raw.	1946.0941644476002
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns
for several minutes if not more.	1494.1704236155408
—Know how to keep them off?	948.2390088117058
he inquired generally.	1887.3367170923389
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
	1616.8162965611493
That boggles ’em.	946.4336915828404
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	1758.5891396716977
It ran
as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	946.6509258350843
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having
detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he
represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after
having boxed the compass on the strict q.t.	1625.9157386619206
somewhere) and the
fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some
Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say
that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was
at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had
consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead
which was his longest.	1692.5477354666907
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work
a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
with the net result that the scheme fell through.	1623.3710949502345
But even suppose it
did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was
not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering
the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there
and back.	1722.3012393703232
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone
and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose
liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,
Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive
tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern
Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,
abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	1595.8003051860094
Another thing
just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze
around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a
concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure
resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,
Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the
Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly
remunerative.	1452.2091278045546
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or
local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise
and I’ll post you the ticket.	1302.331864504352
No, something top notch, an all star
Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal
consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes
and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of
success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some
fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and
thus combine business with pleasure.	1500.7531904047262
But who?	592.3640888758189
That was the rub.	822.3911141104468
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was
to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with
the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was
mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments
with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete
fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	1783.4475126713005
A great opportunity there certainly
was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public
at large, the average man, i.e.	1840.0437568106881
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took
me for a wife.	1471.0601502392153
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more
humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the
grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at
her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	1706.1694101482121
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there
was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in
Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood
for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds
of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly
grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that
the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering
the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,
rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when
young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off
the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their
left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the
pillar.	1741.4573698065003
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
desired.	1910.309367956203
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	1600.9721882970725
He turned back the
other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	1128.6468591655723
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened
and every pill was something different.	1627.5322689000125
One was a ship, another was a
house, another was a flower.	1440.8537728475967
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly
added, the chinks does.	1871.0428361516817
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	2047.506348980868
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	841.8267882757198
Knife in his
back.	676.4056329255973
Knife like that.	360.2611213334049
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	1466.0785536344856
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	1910.925803906294
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	1481.0001220518086
Like that.	592.3640888758189
_Prepare to
meet your God_, says he.	559.1174996677069
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	1120.4157487068603
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to.	1867.1769810233793
—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
_stiletto_.	1392.2737644103913
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before
in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	2199.8217546170786
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
the dark said for the benefit of them all.	1335.417170509085
That was why they thought
the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account
of them using knives.	1758.6161593593176
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is
bliss_ Mr B.	1260.450352496317
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
from his boiler affair.	1770.7731780789838
His inscrutable face which was really a work of
art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the
impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.	1813.6809676589576
Funny, very!
	592.3640888758189
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	1512.138816961438
One man was reading in fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.	2059.274692112764
Mr Bloom, so far as
he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	1364.50647633879
He
vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
just turned fifteen.	1785.9177368670203
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	1334.6073752947734
Give us back them papers.	1376.861144421135
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	1470.239298630775
—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	885.8848809648373
Mr Bloom inquired.	592.3640888758189
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
no.	1423.8618846747788
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences
but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the
sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	1587.937955756065
—What year would that be about?	1512.1139591971946
Mr B interrogated.	592.3640888758189
Can you recall the
boats?	1185.2756593705142
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
answering:
	1823.8605849571838
—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	1501.3042904711433
Salt junk all the time.	476.04666714411206
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	991.9833491915258
His questioner perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
what it meant to rule the waves.	1699.9824402066076
On more than one occasion, a dozen at
the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
somewhere sings.	1745.379767906719
And it left him wondering why.	1512.1281635529294
Possibly he had tried
to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the
antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not
exactly under, tempting the fates.	1555.0072247290668
And the odds were twenty to nil
there was really no secret about it at all.	1605.6397287743414
Nevertheless, without going
into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that
the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things
somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence
though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that
sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery
and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for
that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable
institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland
or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like
that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and
coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid
the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that
every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to
capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had
experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	1823.013752840199
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,
himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.	1643.2106974229691
Them are his trousers I’ve on me
and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	1301.7908683765488
I’m game for that job,
shaving and brushup.	1626.5621081035863
I hate roaming about.	1196.2980565823661
There’s my son now, Danny,
run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where
he could be drawing easy money.	1556.6041488508095
—What age is he?	646.1030705570519
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	1712.8602951433795
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	1213.3098084960238
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	1196.2870995024514
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was
to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent
an anchor.	1640.1166826422352
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	1406.8955637473434
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	1267.0766263407481
It’s them black lads I objects
to.	1003.5224923028716
I hate those buggers.	1196.2896282679212
Suck your blood dry, they does.	1512.138816961438
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.	1542.4118682076905
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	1196.3022706333559
That was done when we were lying
becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	847.6648933864248
Fellow, the
name of Antonio, done that.	537.0885738372243
There he is himself, a Greek.	835.3261885452905
—Did it hurt much doing it?	1512.124612505627
one asked the sailor.	1661.0461505653907
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	1692.180977218837
Someway in his.	946.3395679814349
Squeezing or.	592.3640888758189
—See here, he said, showing Antonio.	835.6290203601549
There he is cursing the mate.	1512.1103335782434
And
there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	1785.182832048383
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
time stretched over.	1431.9616077321753
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	1512.2289737953772
He’s gone
too.	1196.3073178489926
Ate by sharks after.	1196.3022706333559
Ay, ay.	592.3640888758189
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
of before.	1670.1682324698997
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	1616.78963093394
—And what’s the number for?	1055.9849844294797
loafer number two queried.	2415.9703606606904
—Eaten alive?	592.3640888758189
a third asked the sailor.	1540.0005552108548
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time
with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
direction of the questioner about the number.	1580.6325110508944
A Greek he was.	513.3723012887309
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his
alleged end:
	1795.629782878794
—As bad as old Antonio,
	675.4859772780535
For he left me on my ownio.	946.7782134612455
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	1701.0113202070306
Mr Bloom,
scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
why pink.	1677.0173816153635
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round
the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
and begged the chance of his washing.	1475.5144092842418
Also why washing which seemed
rather vague than not, your washing.	1871.0757164967567
Still candour compelled him to
admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles
street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled
with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they
really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	1642.720025473254
Still
just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than
her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a
rude sign to take herself off.	2157.87731536593
Round the side of the _Evening
Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side
of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was
not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of
gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more
of her.	1113.4014440932515
—The gunboat, the keeper said.	1185.2664097336044
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
senses, if he values his health in the least.	1417.9811230696905
Unfortunate creature! Of
course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	1188.3908497157286
Still no matter what the cause is from...	1474.204261798162
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
remarking:
	1870.9824425306713
—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
roaring trade.	1845.449852935977
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul.	1905.4133433403626
She is a bad merchant.	1376.6480109431168
She buys dear and sells cheap.	1512.131714825138
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a
prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be
put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart
from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,
were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a
thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a
stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	1814.60028978196
Whoever embarked on a
policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would
confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	1890.9984463401606
—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
in the soul.	1761.1196808550826
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	1717.7399630217799
I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men
as the convolutions of the grey matter.	1706.4629841124809
Otherwise we would never have
such inventions as X rays, for instance.	1046.4358479508112
Do you?	592.3640888758189
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
and concentrate and remember before he could say:
	1579.9880685246949
—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
therefore incorruptible.	1560.0534033467854
It would be immortal, I understand, but for
the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
being excluded by court etiquette.	1383.0587518388138
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
rejoining:
	1706.8453709801165
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.	1455.9564531350568
Of course, I grant
you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
blue moon.	1519.0332963122644
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,
though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour
to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	1476.2449955208392
—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
evidence.	1413.9947346924018
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference
in their respective ages, clashed.	1996.7107751941908
—Has been?	592.3640888758189
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
original point with a smile of unbelief.	1989.6371293111408
I’m not so sure about that.	1189.3478807630142
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the
sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
there.	1569.6838102989102
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the
big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.	1341.372716000586
Can’t you drink that
coffee, by the way?	1090.5747263698938
And take a piece of that bun.	1323.5289392702732
It’s
like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.	1692.3004131659704
Try a bit.	461.5479987353844
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with
something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance
(and lucrative) work.	1618.918382634166
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond
yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the
lower orders.	1848.4779966761969
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful
recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been
prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration
indeed for her pianoplaying.	1428.1210011114288
The idea, he was strongly inclined to
believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to
speak of.	1898.4787123208569
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas
he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he
couldn’t remember when it was or where.	1539.4750643964248
Anyhow inspection, medical
inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary
which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on
account of the medical analysis involved.	1317.1472369341925
—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
stirred.	1760.7278724773214
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
took a sip of the offending beverage.	1885.6287382191213
You ought to eat more solid food.	1373.827217759446
You would feel a different
man.	974.0967953525824
—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
But O, oblige me by taking away that
knife.	1512.1198776204224
I can’t look at the point of it.	702.4258119659431
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated
article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly
Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was
the least conspicuous point about it.	1793.2196994143835
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	1489.8706269267157
Do you think they are
genuine?	1512.0253908876666
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
lie like old boots.	1959.4013731176608
Look at him.	507.14914436813314
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
accurate gospel.	1729.6250375736925
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	1360.0239575909081
Though a
wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a
jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to
associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill
fraternity.	2150.673357212002
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his
own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he
killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in
durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to
the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our
national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above
described.	1980.3753881332698
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable
weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like
those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner
who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
_Hesperus_ and etcetera.	1685.448351014424
And when all was said and done the lies a
fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to
the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	2099.2262760004996
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.	1226.8414719225607
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	1767.7382664043837
Giants,
though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
midget queen.	1189.3420445174997
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten
their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
gods.	1706.6136643128184
There’s an example again of simple souls.	1700.0417199040842
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the
boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
incompatible about it, he conceded.	1572.691438419806
On the contrary that stab in the
back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the
fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in
little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking
fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless
necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to
have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or
her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	1831.2762910462668
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	1699.5077360616522
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	756.3698031735624
Point of fact she could
actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
(technically) Spain, i.e.	1206.6696229603433
She has the Spanish type.	592.3640888758189
Quite
dark, regular brunette, black.	1376.8650244983396
I for one certainly believe climate
accounts for character.	1767.7509515422116
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
in Italian.	935.4716503435337
—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
passionate about ten shillings.	1110.669865132192
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	1196.3022706333559
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	592.3640888758189
—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
Tommaso Mastino.	1205.9973429454337
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	577.5345598806807
All are washed in the
blood of the sun.	453.7740838965838
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	1147.1422105497527
The splendid
proportions of hips, bosom.	1512.138816961438
You simply don’t knock against those kind
of women here.	1871.299337666443
An exception here and there.	770.3885136599279
Handsome yes, pretty in a
way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.	1319.5379018338815
Besides
they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly
enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	1629.944071487998
Rumpled
stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a
thing I simply hate to see.	1180.459116076917
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	1652.0288815007007
Shipahoy of course
had his own say to say.	1435.852315352534
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	1651.3570701612916
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry
Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	1298.2556310913344
That was the talk
of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of
original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish
_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore
in commotion petrified with horror.	1460.895011093347
Then someone said something about
the case of the s.	1265.229958449246
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_
which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with
all hands on deck.	1523.097346270614
No aid was given.	1196.276985265057
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he
was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	1346.0597541439809
She had no water, it
appears, in her hold.	1767.6417891004846
At this stage an incident happened.	1512.138816961438
It having become necessary for him
to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	1659.6118481715494
—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	1777.4087276262194
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
due left.	1514.8947555032403
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s
rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew
and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig
out of it with a gurgling noise.	1532.1268819103402
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had
a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the
counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was
all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	1674.6519065981713
Some
person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by
the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a
brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,
evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the
noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the
ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	1953.0282236616351
A hoof scooped
anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	1911.3505995196813
Slightly
disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of
the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking
up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now
practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin
in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before
shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again
in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its
most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and
familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a
cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass
proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	1849.6538051497298
And there he was at the
end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink
without a beggarly stiver.	1280.3590957342342
He drank needless to be told and it pointed
only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of
business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his
particular partiality.	1865.5245252799941
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the
same thing.	1589.4323691770674
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra
basin, the only launch that year.	1354.213239807902
Right enough the harbours were there
only no ships ever called.	1871.0624045762438
There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
fait_.	1734.2301002204463
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
Worthington or some name like that, eh?	1363.7620805144702
Ask the then captain, he
advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that
day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	1125.8332114396312
—Am I right, skipper?	841.8114424048898
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
private potation and the rest of his exertions.	1736.9421548300325
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or
other in seconds or thirds.	1905.5933105606443
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then
expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have
lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and
making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in
question.	1613.3481098877019
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful
libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the
_soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:
	2030.8481346895294
—The biscuits was as hard as brass
	1373.765086991136
And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.	1275.2221687509991
O, Johnny Lever!
	592.3640888758189
Johnny Lever, O!
	592.3640888758189
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none
on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal
in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every
year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained
out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through
the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot
more surplus steam in the same vein.	1716.9575612619346
Their conversation accordingly
became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	1237.5818535915562
You could grow any
mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel
Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	1020.7593527288183
Where would you find
anywhere the like of Irish bacon?	992.1106704136031
But a day of reckoning, he stated
_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the
conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
pelf on account of her crimes.	1665.0584943664924
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their
little lookin, he affirmed.	1075.3224620056415
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	950.4018431362712
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be
Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the
vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at
once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the
tendon referred to on his boot.	1651.3098894454824
His advice to every Irishman was: stay
in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	1005.8668140908793
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	1597.1421910837362
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	1626.217234813633
The
impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	1700.0678893036218
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	1768.2409234701308
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	1871.321401679011
—Who’s the best troops in the army?	979.5623255195154
the grizzled old veteran irately
interrogated.	2414.7535004865094
And the best jumpers and racers?	1512.0267789990294
And the best admirals
and generals we’ve got?	1767.678796770236
Tell me that.	946.3701482253739
—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
blemishes apart.	1196.295247109066
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	1373.674070303651
The Irish catholic
peasant.	841.8114424048898
He’s the backbone of our empire.	1616.5677446520308
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no
Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	1925.7036657295534
Then they began to have a
few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,
appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with
interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to
blows.	1753.6921869964306
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he
was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the
channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,
rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	1783.033949171816
It was quite on a
par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred
million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out
and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all
he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of
contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it
was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both
countries even though poles apart.	1944.6392814398287
Another little interesting point,
the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,
reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against
her, more so, in fact.	1422.4109712292375
And now, why?	946.4336915828404
So the scene between the pair of
them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,
the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him
forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,
that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human
soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	1793.2649860991478
And as for the
lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.)
couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people
like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and
refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private
life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a
Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like
Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	1707.0477539401838
Quite apart from
that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	1976.5400931362535
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his
bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it
(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for
a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage
of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a
party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of
the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,
after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with
the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	1848.9449427137827
In any case
that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo
Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	1714.4734708359003
He ought
to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	1121.357918759503
Like actresses,
always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	1911.342206371988
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any
idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	1968.81645197857
So
similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid
of some £.	1034.9189283570563
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in
the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin
and so on.	939.3197852987659
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the
same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually
silenced the offender.	1586.8796773872855
—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	1452.3681924469142
He called me a jew and
in a heated fashion offensively.	1422.5990117385886
So I without deviating from plain
facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and
all his family like me though in reality I’m not.	1177.619292809953
That was one for him.	812.0163291171177
A soft answer turns away wrath.	1512.138816961438
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as
everyone saw.	1282.5253282828862
Am I not right?	841.8114424048898
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.	1591.345477884497
—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
other, _secundum carnem_.	1405.1412695928655
—Of course, Mr B.	592.3640888758189
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
of the question.	1762.9104737708396
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
government it deserves.	2183.1304041088883
But with a little goodwill all round.	1322.992477164762
It’s all
very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual
equality.	1636.7183488880805
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	1456.7647826492823
It
never reaches anything or stops anything.	1616.8260600451579
A revolution must come on the
due instalments plan.	1767.470077494485
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
in the next house so to speak.	1358.4964962757974
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen
assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.	972.8803393297687
Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
was overwhelmingly right.	1567.6667430458906
And the whole world was full of that sort of
thing.	848.3882307589229
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	1039.3681967255325
A hocuspocus of
conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...	1563.0085234300732
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad
blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	1851.308845149287
—They accuse, remarked he audibly.	1376.8650244983396
He turned away from the others, who
probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…
	1602.8812289143088
—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of
ruining.	1512.1104171917186
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.	1003.2737773130808
History, would
you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer
for, imported them.	1480.769570742409
Because they are imbued with the proper
spirit.	1699.3010788943138
They are practical and are proved to be so.	1392.1885308914714
I don’t want to
indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and
then orthodox as you are.	1345.6143893432752
But in the economic, not touching religion,
domain the priest spells poverty.	1911.672086068343
Spain again, you saw in the war,
compared with goahead America.	1449.3316035752953
It’s in the dogma.	895.2589932418464
Because if
they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d
try to live better, at least so I think.	1557.5682883229724
I’m, he resumed with dramatic
force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the
outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes
_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion
either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.	1544.5805886397516
That’s the
vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of
friendlier intercourse between man and man.	1986.146337578513
At least that’s my idea for
what it’s worth.	1576.0103130373973
I call that patriotism.	1196.281199670174
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a
smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	1470.9964599625182
Where
you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	1525.325941150933
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	1448.1468406060098
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
beneath or seemed to.	1591.861477714956
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	1727.3442903619916
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	1767.7556843431103
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
who owned them pro tem.	1959.3253679514298
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
must work, have to, together.	2415.911438631491
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
possible sense.	1428.9594854019806
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
thing.	1273.602794537977
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
nowadays.	1554.8697426993447
That’s work too.	1196.299154040122
Important work.	592.3640888758189
After all, from the little I
know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	1811.064429506475
You have every bit
as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
peasant has.	2113.060865324073
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	1109.5762381412678
Each is equally important.	1196.3022706333559
—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
Ireland for short.	802.8968171180443
—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	870.8366816731195
—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
because it belongs to me.	902.1573027349411
—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
some misapprehension.	1192.0994095985054
Excuse me.	592.3640888758189
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the
latter portion.	1298.5945765766166
What was it you...?	899.5487847554421
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:
	1602.474298057666
—We can’t change the country.	1250.3746275931978
Let us change the subject.	895.8288065069792
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction
to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	1495.0992946122794
The rebuke of some
kind was clearer than the other part.	1327.054640616722
Needless to say the fumes of his
recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
foreign to his sober state.	1956.33429778232
Probably the homelife to which Mr B
attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he
hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	1583.298188391996
With a touch of
fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an
air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in
the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	1975.7148340535102
For
instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy
faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad
vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a
nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously
sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	1638.5347582365698
And then the usual
_dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed
into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a
strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so
as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law
amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not
divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	1727.3165476585234
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly
turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and
the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in
the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,
then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high
personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,
he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running
counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before
under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good
Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the
reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women
chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being
largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	1686.7235703230456
Ladies who like
distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,
trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of
a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned
his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the
cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a
continental.	2029.374278105987
However, reverting to the original, there were on the
other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest
rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	1523.9647713175218
Sheer force of natural genius,
that.	1512.1317147529485
With brains, sir.	946.4336915828404
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad
having in fact let himself in for it.	1767.082750992741
Still to cultivate the
acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
for reflection would amply repay any small.	2126.129648272237
Intellectual stimulation,
as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the
mind.	1602.0932986474018
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,
row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,
the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of
the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,
viz.	1931.9064947909994
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the
microscope lately.	2415.8035173641897
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he
might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy
if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the
common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea
per column.	1572.6611575279128

The pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie
lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just
puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and
the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard
was addressed A.	1431.354380222505
First he got a bit of a
start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H.	1060.2572594831283

which, he
reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.	2045.3005608098117
Or a change of address
anyway.	1512.1006785663358
—_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr
Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,
Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin.	887.5494859448332

most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
he is deeply regretted.	2039.1235255371641

the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there
could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and
a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford’s after all managing to.	1760.3458936636919

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing
though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to
congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	1976.1518522689994
Guesswork it
reduced itself to eventually.	1512.1317147529485
—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	1344.9407443124317
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	1513.4481833432462
One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:
_Return of Parnell_.	1309.7729060193521
He bet them what they liked.	1512.1089032987072
A Dublin fusilier was

Pride it
was killed him.	1377.0514369682667
He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for
a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
no-one to point a finger at him.	1648.561583942509
Then they would all to a man have gone
down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his
senses.	1431.639513743666
Dead he wasn’t.	666.1433601911914
Simply absconded somewhere.	946.4336915828404
The coffin they
brought over was full of stones.	1481.0352634962035
He changed his name to De Wet, the
Boer general.	784.6870058716829
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	1409.648367499019
And so forth and
so on.	588.2435782731391
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
was twenty odd years.	1748.7511619354048
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
inadvisable, all things considered.	1770.2751545735405
Something evidently riled them in
his death.	1189.3524494019214
Of course nobody being acquainted
with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his
whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order
even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and
Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within
the bounds of possibility.	1730.2686412957435
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as
a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,
a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged
feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on
the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were
very few and far between.	1818.80868870985
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with
feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on
him with mutual mudslinging.	2018.6592179403897
And the identical same with murderers.	1512.138816961438
You
had to come back.	797.0684355645977
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	1616.7731592558605
To show the
understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	1824.1908984273616
He saw him once on the
auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_
or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in
point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he
said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid
exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the
cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.	1404.9609505908418
Still as regards return.	1196.2938424605543
You
were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got
back.	1799.1344552686614
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and
Harry against.	731.0248073280234
And then, number one, you came up against the man in
possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the
Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to
the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence
went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew
was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some
pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description
given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or
some such commonplace remark.	1505.3878008559827
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to
the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under
discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land
first.	1606.07956072285
—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
commented.	1263.5625500296046
She put the first nail in his coffin.	1547.8955262205768
—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	1042.5462448274484
She loosened many a man’s thighs.	1056.6310787583327
I seen her picture in a barber’s.	1699.5531673619182
The husband was a captain or an
officer.	1547.875384656485
—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	1057.3878738169528
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	2026.1889631400186
As regards Bloom he, without
the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the
door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
between them full of sweet nothings.	1749.8922894349112
First it was strictly Platonic
till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till
bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of
the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not
a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his
downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to
anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed
into.	1935.7019398691475
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared
favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the
rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared
her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went
through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape
of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a
particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment
with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained
admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the
lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	1818.65690193411
Whereas the
simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not
being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the
name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of
weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home
ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.	1909.1533216928065
The eternal
question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.	1502.4448202947865
Can real
love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist
between married folk?	1613.7416443326135
Though it was no concern of theirs
absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of
folly.	1776.2731709846141
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented
obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military
supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my
gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th
hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,
that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,
woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame
which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the
gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved
evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts
of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that
exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his
matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in
the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.	1945.8664064538752
Looking back now in a
retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	1401.7109014782145
And then
coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without
saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the
times.	1977.444374025597
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not
been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as
it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	1442.8653263555827
North or south,
however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
every shred of decency to the winds.	1938.87950792442
—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
Stephen, about blood and the sun.	1090.5240863931267
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she
was Spanish too.	987.7637496872894
—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
so many.	1113.8908014027768
—Was she?	592.3640888758189
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
means, I never heard that rumour before.	1438.4446448082033
Possible, especially there, it
was as she lived there.	1626.634544946893
So, Spain.	592.3640888758189
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out
his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained
rapidly finally he.	1327.0516986466644
—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	1404.4088913869648
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,
standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which
was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all
the vogue.	1818.3433451839767
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about
to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland
street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the
esthetic execution.	1337.6148878439606
—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
indicated.	841.8062099726058
Taken a few years since.	1185.2121816328986
In or about ninety six.	1376.8572642759873
Very like
her then.	899.5734117827359
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his
legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major
Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a
singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered
barely sweet sixteen.	1760.1713433554355
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage
in that getup.	1630.7446929208656
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for
the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	1885.0059304601575
Marble could give the original,
shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	1568.9619993257377
Yes, puritanisme, it
does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne
toi trop.	946.429477856009
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a
word.	1395.5553053063654
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to
speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the
beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in
itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	1841.4289321227454
Though it was a warm pleasant sort
of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for
sunshine after storm.	1609.2853959777183
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to
follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by
moving a motion.	1715.1634899725018
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly
soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear
however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further
increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her
symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	2152.5740942571742
In fact the slight soiling was only
an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,
much better in fact with the starch out.	1917.6164543642426
Suppose she was gone when he?	1512.063875436511
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely
as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning
littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses
(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately
beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	1705.3650141090166
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
_distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of
the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.	1724.3615148958456
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it
was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	1626.4649076607334
And why not?	507.19202448485635
An
awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a
lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same
old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or
the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about
the whole business.	1908.4310623874646
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor
tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made
absolute.	1802.5567191696757
He, B,
enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the
flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen
leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when
clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the
number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated
into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United
Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up
the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of
some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite
scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile
tribune’s private morals.	1677.2745251151587
Though palpably a radically altered man he
was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with
that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the
shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that
their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which
she, however, was the first to perceive.	1970.7154880519076
As those were particularly hot
times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a
nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated
lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a
grave character.	1801.2206433987133
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently
knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who
picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to
return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)
who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat
at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the
country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos
of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into
him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good
form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and
thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in
a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	1576.2877505237798
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter
from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the
crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.	1947.9490509996065
He personally, being of a
sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about
saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	2043.4166974558552
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last
him his lifetime.	2123.6190927637813
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day
take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the
interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the
gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump
Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular
lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as
to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl
courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to
their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of
complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and
flowers and chocs.	1687.3431089651406
The
queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who
was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something
substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made
on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty
Dumpty boiled.	1849.935299007381
—At what o’clock did you dine?	1616.7822067006189
he questioned of the slim form and tired
though unwrinkled face.	2417.1175832789604
—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	592.3640888758189
—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
Friday.	1048.403075139158
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!
	1452.8678673738839
—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.	974.770988082896
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	1018.0146773933068
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
one train of thought.	1649.4748547454917
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some
score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a
sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	1626.1921705036968
For instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted
with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	2062.782033071559
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	1255.8195426249665
The crux was it was
a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.	1694.9785968426584
On the
other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which
of the two alternatives.	1075.5503461365038
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved
him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things
considered.	1431.360232046582
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or
not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	1619.5264769300331
For one thing he mightn’t
what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried
him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in
his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	1854.9076315147836
At all events he wound up
by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of
Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two
and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands
and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast
amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort
was kicked up.	1929.7493275233328
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t
appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly
beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse
of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would
be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few
days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with
sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to
freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized
charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment
of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for
as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as
Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	1953.4923694484658
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over
his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being
a jew.	1642.4882642232826
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what
properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	2001.2775672955597
The most vulnerable point
too of tender Achilles.	1196.2938424177219
Your god was a jew.	573.5729871531602
Because mostly they
appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts
in the county Sligo.	1018.5034168405332
—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come
home with me and talk things over.	2041.0789473419438
My diggings are quite close in the
vicinity.	1268.9665259304668
You can’t drink that stuff.	1334.5987160282036
Do you like cocoa?	1196.3010042999028
I’ll
just pay this lot.	1512.1281635529294
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the
keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.	1890.2997836109446
—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	985.1476389778505
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,
education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from
the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.	1645.0695163756836
An opening was all was
wanted.	1512.0873972589811
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to
bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be
just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the
direction of that particular red herring just to.	1368.7663744327033
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association
dinner in London somewhere.	1261.9808506729566
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
thrilling announcement.	1823.2382264517619
Then the old specimen in the corner who
appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony
MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to
that effect.	1374.707563144016
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered
why.	1626.5436037765444
—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	1874.8952108408048
—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	1700.0648950022423
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	1474.9726162937652
—Are you bad in the eyes?	1250.8720204689257
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
queried.	2414.6793593033117
—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a
bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	1535.8336105322521
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	650.6169669697325
One time I could read a book in the
dark, manner of speaking.	1126.4796967119155
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my
favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._
	714.4733699971293
Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
remark.	1777.6021791278542
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four
coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	1813.8196494672611
—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	1616.806532474486
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and
company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
_dolce far niente_.	2047.6035345436594
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	1529.5211080077202
—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
the moment.	1220.9014589829403
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
upside down, on the tables in cafés.	1450.4242804742307
To which impromptu the
neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying
straight off:
	1438.4606546535588
—To sweep the floor in the morning.	772.4084679342715
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the
bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	1653.5780888632517
The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
weak on his pins.	1397.5665719737035
—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a
moment.	1209.2524631196964
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.	1588.6078001713458
It’s not far.	1196.2070727454939
Lean on me.	647.1446764854036
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on
accordingly.	1438.4441974118847
—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
all that.	1612.812442144848
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	1626.535301515124
where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
of fresh fields and pastures new.	1402.6909429072834
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	1728.0197110459665
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	1605.057490918991
Wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_,
Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_
he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
into a cocked hat.	1266.5502115275312
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the
catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line
such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live
thy protestant to be_.	1405.5432791912106
He also yielded to none in his admiration of
Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and
putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church
in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	1746.944084207584
There was the
unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
a generally voiced desire for an encore.	1383.6256673118353
And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha,
M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from
the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of
the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	1575.0246558750214
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but
launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or
about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near
Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an
instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,
whom B.	1299.6635566097307
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded
familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_
and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he
said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one
Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	1405.9834915974325
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to
sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	1823.9159120839104
He inquired if it was John Bull the
political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical
names, as a striking coincidence.	1433.228684281547
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,
Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s
sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:
	1787.9480838831655
—Our lives are in peril tonight.	1512.1235705114455
Beware of the steamroller.	1195.3654486092223
They thereupon stopped.	946.4336915828404
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even
flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a
blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot
foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with
his thoughts.	1839.868290985576
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump
of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared
for every emergency that might crop up.	1898.996299944962
He was just a big nervous
foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	1083.9526256481358
But
even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the
same size, would be a holy horror to face.	1375.2697890779095
But it was no animal’s fault
in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	1885.3452148113743
Nine tenths of them
all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring
the bees.	1693.072434454529
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of
his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my
eagle eye.	1919.847326357481
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field
occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the
ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly
interesting old.	1491.1702028171615
—What’s this I was saying?	748.7492449481616
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in
medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	1773.6865796365057
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after
as he was perhaps not that way built.	1823.2113382123396
Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it
opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish
industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in
general.	1279.6448428123756
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
come from.	973.5342124387714
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
which boggled Bloom a bit:
	1156.293910470019
Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
	592.3640888758189
Tun die Poeten dichten.	592.3640888758189
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	1700.0529172407441
Bloom, nodding,
said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
he did.	1642.5899466248836
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could
easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice
production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the
bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and
procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into
fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial
magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his
university degree of B.	1870.9515944149957
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly
bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would
infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which
also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his
clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into
their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial
niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate
against you.	2010.2448119324436
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily
foresee him participating in their musical and artistic
_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for
choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and
being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away,
he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.	1907.381500741689
Added
to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be
sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	1623.1663716269115
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and
both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity
in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a
cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	2174.462381194108
Besides, though
taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,
different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue
as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the
usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public
by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	1580.1119369647397
Yes,
beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and
he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high
place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,
booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street
house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,
so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort
to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too
much fêted prince of good fellows.	1821.0154999814447
And it need not detract from the
other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time
to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing
without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything
derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	1893.0977705167656
In fact, he
had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,
possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,
hung on to him at all.	1537.9652099953335
The horse was just then.	1376.8328039027683
And later on at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side
of a person’s character, no pun intended.	1900.7938917634176
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted
and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting
fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three
smoking globes of turds.	1734.578739198662
Slowly three times, one after another, from a
full crupper he mired.	1737.9828979716513
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)
had ended, patient in his scythed car.	2026.5316307575472
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	1358.3664535569576
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	592.3640888758189
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
Father Maher_.	1866.5748248878647
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of
other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the
kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in
the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they
were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner
street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	1642.1958231313956
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	809.5736584060694
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,
bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	1183.1306786898829
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the
circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle
being less than the arc which it subtends.	1806.6101347765964
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	1513.1141617176945
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.	1400.115843320821
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	1856.1784675148556
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial.	1946.1168182050167
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	2066.4495983433853
Both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	2158.990325759461
Both admitted the
alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism.	1871.0726162658123
Were their views on some points divergent?	1616.8041252186883
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	1239.3094621709654
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism
involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign
of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt
(† 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
and interred at Rossnaree.	956.194068311205
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric
inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
no bigger than a woman’s hand.	1640.8616559876084
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	1911.3151976323618
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
paraheliotropic trees.	1252.5193116672906
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
the past?	1200.0353847950958
In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and
Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield
avenue.	713.7970081608591
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the
wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of
Uppercross.	753.6287213874908
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines.	1994.5605785459743
In 1888 frequently with major
Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.	864.9960523195929
Once
in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both
occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street,
west.	809.1537166802068
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
their destination?	995.8004220650413
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a
restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	1973.7634064880915
As in what ways?	1196.2643416246938
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from
existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	2029.650163310297
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?	971.091882976823
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,
number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back
pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	1630.7344846501815
Was it there?	737.2805475510427
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding.	1412.512953229524
Why was he doubly irritated?	1376.799983428115
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget.	1598.4083125318232
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	1946.0034552127584
To enter or not to enter.	1130.4505711136958
To knock or not to knock.	1130.4532260601563
Bloom’s decision?	946.4336915828404
A stratagem.	592.3640888758189
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.	1979.6361586563578
Did he fall?	946.4336915828404
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era
five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand
three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.	1437.202347845903
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	1512.138816961438
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame
which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit
finally a portable candle.	2207.019003057301
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	1106.4301849033661
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	1626.6296321579866
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	1376.9493257327792
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor.	2054.583420530635
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	1616.7976150767004
In the open
space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his
candle.	1844.946442500998
Did Stephen obey his sign?	1039.41860477134
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and
followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and
lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and
carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the
kitchen of Bloom’s house.	1768.9401946359715
What did Bloom do?	592.3640888758189
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three
projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby
releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its
carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen
of the air.	1786.7937101443179
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	885.1534237904042
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of
his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of
his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.	922.277339269509
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
the fire towards the opposite wall?	1599.3620189756393
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.	2145.95904786494
What did Bloom see on the range?	971.9926318847226
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
(larger) hob a black iron kettle.	1939.5627779755266
What did Bloom do at the range?	784.7513077991664
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
let it flow.	1895.239024938315
Did it flow?	737.2874734175336
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen
of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a
distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving
tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace
bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and
daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the
sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	1344.1203149946207
E., on the instructions of
the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals
as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a
reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the
corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
solvent, sound.	1497.9876868335475
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire?	1368.070256923631
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the
Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,
photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning
moon.	2078.0892162548525
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
return to the stillflowing tap?	1862.008703535638
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in
a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	2006.3526943355168
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?	784.6746171349952
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the
month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous
substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and
language.	1834.2614103060437
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	1776.8941360521962
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	1691.6755368720237
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	1700.0065351386695
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	2119.796892466756
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	1425.173655930739
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation.	1911.3354730653286
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire?	1547.7431358243698
The phenomenon of ebullition.	1196.3022706333559
Fanned by a constant updraught of
ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
ether.	2212.3162824781843
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,
was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of
calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the
temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.	1758.153146814168
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	1626.538683302737
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously.	1713.4357728719745
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	1344.9697253375484
To shave himself.	946.4336915828404
What advantages attended shaving by night?	1250.4245490025655
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if
unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at
incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a
cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal
noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a
postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,
relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he
sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving
and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected
and applied adhered: which was to be done.	2127.537004789118
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	1911.318620389668
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
feminine passive active hand.	1890.9136939976759
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
influence?	1795.6250870395888
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
surgery.	1930.181306607502
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	1635.0532656073806
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	1969.885804233965
On the middle shelf a
chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink
tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne
Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a
cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two
onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,
bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a
quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,
acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity
subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one
imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a
halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak.	1672.546834970823
On the
upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and
proveniences.	1976.4014164747452
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	1632.1302055454078
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
numbered 8 87, 88 6.	1196.2842088303214
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	1334.6470618381256
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.	1145.8317424608013
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
been received by him?	1775.4036015328427
In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in
O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had
placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising
Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the
premises of F.	849.5980951293762
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,
when Frederick M.	784.6746171349952
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively
requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the
_Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to
throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the
oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,
with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	1215.7283562295659
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by
failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
originally from a successful interpretation.	2272.6288644969236
His mood?	592.3640888758189
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
was satisfied.	1449.530434212702
To have sustained no positive loss.	1512.138816961438
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	1190.0504219833867
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
prescribed.	1803.3972897227163
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest?	1686.9609227939816
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
(Molly).	1494.0968416511453
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality?	1837.0663364813822
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he
accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s
massproduct, the creature cocoa.	1862.1293156537427
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
complete the act begun?	2095.217133208238
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
side of his guest’s jacket.	1257.0146610295794
A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
condition.	1368.5110100487543
Who drank more quickly?	1196.2938424605543
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and
taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a
steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one,
six to two, nine to three.	2081.066071392699
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	1512.138816961438
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived
from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself
had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	1859.5090530095954
Had he found their solution?	1376.833981978199
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
the answers not bearing in all points.	2199.6134043439774
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the
offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for
competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	1232.6001958290103
An ambition to squint
	1196.3022706333559
At my verses in print
	1376.861144421135
Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.	1585.5701581584156
Then please place at the end
	866.8221451899296
The name of yours truly, L.	946.4018474593105
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	1911.327014092393
Name, age, race, creed.	1196.3022706333559
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	1692.1292992233168
Leopold Bloom
Ellpodbomool
Molldopeloob
Bollopedoom
Old Ollebo, M.	592.3640888758189
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?	1159.409273037325
Poets oft have sung in rhyme
	1512.138816961438
Of music sweet their praise divine.	1512.138816961438
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	1616.8228055439354
Dearer far than song or wine.	1512.1317148251362
You are mine.	737.2943990675084
The world is mine.	991.9614731485505
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	1512.1263288199625
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the
grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	1046.1616271277408
Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by
George A.	592.3640888758197
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan
under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie
Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,
principal girl?	732.9596210574996
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke
and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,
associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new
high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
Barton.	1329.7646476048055
What relation existed between their ages?	1512.1139589084246
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen
was 6.	673.8531188988467
16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present
age Bloom would be 54.	718.2256202686007
In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until
he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been
obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have
been born in the year 81,396 B.C.	986.3649461091551
What events might nullify these calculations?	1512.1352658891194
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	1604.9388634956367
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	1700.070883610277
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina
Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
hand in salutation.	844.6581938499351
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on
a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s
father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.	784.8275852784576
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
afterwards seconded by the father?	1677.8042684019902
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	2047.7044960576277
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
third connecting link between them?	1588.6293353736517
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
house of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891
and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City
Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during
parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of
Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in
the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence
of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular
road.	953.1148072119768
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	1317.9545242498161
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with
slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had
remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	1689.9864508620274
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	1910.7953428772187
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	2017.786794327472
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
deceased?	1911.189148397285
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the
statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for
Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	1392.435585914902
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
more desirable?	1978.7386626643047
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	1625.8845201669471
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	1767.7578137035384
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally
developed abdominal muscles.	1982.0371817450718
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	1700.011768130243
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts
about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about
Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?	722.3184612800935
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
knew that he knew that he was not.	644.6347817181851
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
parentages?	1823.850305294844
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag
(subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,
London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius
Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	720.0804189208925
Stephen, eldest
surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin
and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	748.7540805272395
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
layman?	1462.354685003893
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	784.9635458040948
A., alone,
in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	824.403162723386
C., in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	582.7871592191527
Stephen (once) by the
reverend Charles Malone C.	643.3329841788592
C., alone, in the church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar.	572.9274088984629
Did they find their educational careers similar?	1616.8228055439354
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
through a dame’s school and the high school.	1055.1277215031157
Substituting Bloom for
Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the

Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the
university of life?	928.6004583294136
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	1616.8097869429505
The scientific.	592.3640888758189
The artistic.	592.3640888758189
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in
a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	2066.122748933832
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
kindergarten?	1871.06287708414
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults.	1823.8631548295793
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	1287.7547360470533
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	784.6746171349952

the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at

hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in
triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility

What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	991.9689160739051
The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered
in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite
liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m.	1083.086384716947
on
the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of
having, purchased at 3.15 p.m.	728.8147524673113
on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new
boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence
of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin
aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main
street, Ennis.	1171.3956305284482
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
intuition?	1871.079885776621
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?	1348.2792552112355
He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s
words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
relieved.	2049.204458022725
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of the Plums_?	1148.13292877964
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
(e.g.	2033.1191376696452
_My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in
conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of
successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful
achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following
the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,
21 June (S.	1617.1704354810595
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.	634.9398020674086
Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
frequently engaged his mind?	1452.9327263965047
What to do with our wives.	1130.4341754837017
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	1616.664186994466
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,
piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope
addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial
activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress
proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine
satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state
inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular
infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive
superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised
respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction
specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	2299.0246304519897
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	1823.6832630227416
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
Hebrew characters.	1329.1433832203063
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
a city in Canada, Quebec.	1414.4323898310345
She understood little of political
complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	1911.348355186653
In calculating
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	1946.1189275392655
After
completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the
implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the
corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	2176.955523138337
Unusual
polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by
false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_
(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	1897.1469993835076
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	2039.26874722868
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
balances, proved true by construction.	1905.4681151530415
The counterbalance of her
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by
experiment.	1775.687051607366
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	1747.8530606756008
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s
ignorant lapse.	2143.0927600853274
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	1548.0667911287644
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
with error.	1921.1424303330323
What system had proved more effective?	1512.138816961438
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	1196.3022706333559
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	1633.8142765309437
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of
postexilic eminence did he adduce?	1874.891176961978
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)
there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	790.2859123829054
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
Stephen?	1311.1550061301855
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
name uncertain.	1763.3503989082942
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
selected or rejected race mentioned?	1668.2874845908877
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	660.0101279471531
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
by guest to host and by host to guest?	1680.7606137318608
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	1853.0602517330217
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple
amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	1660.8460444903092
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	2082.858460247689
By juxtaposition.	592.3640888758189
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence
of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as
ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.	1349.598173315469
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	2083.2648239965306
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	1905.4671612469178
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
peoples who spoke them?	2002.9814117678914
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the
seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor
of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:
their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,
homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures
comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and
Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,
Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival
and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical
rites in ghetto (S.	1249.350223509066
Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s
tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and
jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the
possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	1207.3720166919268
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
ethnically irreducible consummation?	1386.0946216734937
Kolod balejwaw pnimah
	946.4336915828404
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	946.4336915828404
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	1580.2937722165025
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.	1185.2796600522393
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	1699.9901537843455
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	1341.908440430951
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	1767.7661165133352
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	1317.1088332606369
Did the guest comply with his host’s request?	1767.4388934576182
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	903.1087397107516
What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?	946.4336915828393
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
of the past.	1338.842334160055
What was Bloom’s visual sensation?	946.4336915828393
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
future.	1975.5829993490886
What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional
quasisensations of concealed identities?	1133.3394029881642
Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	1026.787586915236
Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of
catastrophe.	1274.8744224890218
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
what exemplars?	1298.9598364561382
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
reverend John Conmee S.	633.4998847975874
J., the reverend T.	592.3640888758189
Salmon, D.	592.3640888758189
D., provost of
Trinity college, Dr Alexander J.	592.3640888758189
At the bar, English or Irish:
exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	592.3640888758197
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	592.3640888758189
On the stage,
modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,
Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.	698.8922917316138
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a
strange legend on an allied theme?	1813.2443829420918
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
plus cocoa, having been consumed.	2057.9365204178594
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	1480.957593150734
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
	972.0743788581422
Went out for to play ball.	1512.0794142098046
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
	810.0913703194582
He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.	1387.7193159156525
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
	946.4299301588755
He broke the jew’s windows all.	1373.7844460806332
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	981.5097536664746
With unmixed feeling.	946.4336915828404
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw
the unbroken kitchen window.	1625.2291629051615
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	1699.3607727566873
Then out there came the jew’s daughter
	1073.142112090795
And she all dressed in green.	1039.7068429347798
“Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
	1548.08905159827
And play your ball again.”
	1376.8650244983396
I can’t come back and I won’t come back
	899.4231607596128
Without my schoolfellows all.	991.9824392102742
For if my master he did hear
	1616.782661793251
He’d make it a sorry ball.”
	1452.672337624862
She took him by the lilywhite hand
	1094.7013478177491
And led him along the hall
	1056.8590825615186
Until she led him to a room
	1452.4141348312205
Where none could hear him call.	1177.963696405728
She took a penknife out of her pocket
	1211.3047878359814
And cut off his little head.	1512.0479459284834
And now he’ll play his ball no more
	1404.1965195399478
For he lies among the dead.	976.962437242212
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	981.528545861351
With mixed feelings.	946.4336915828404
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s
daughter, all dressed in green.	1481.0921662250655
Condense Stephen’s commentary.	841.8114424048898
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	1390.7606624098987
Once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	1823.855445171015
It comes when
he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of
hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	1907.6503500156768
It leads him to a strange
habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,
immolates him, consenting.	1901.2708072231721
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	1373.6072324730842
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told.	1701.528571583876
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	1373.6099974058907
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	1185.2765092624252
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	1373.6072324730842
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	2187.7624644729094
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune?	1905.3869232032405
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	1604.3035605833059
From
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled
in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its
destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.	1878.3768052150585
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?	1636.5185656234917
What other infantile memories had he of her?	910.4582978000151
15 June 1889.	592.3640888758189
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
lessen congestion.	1871.0702988291812
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
navy.	1580.4613153142973
What endemic characteristics were present?	1376.853384062898
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line
of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	2102.2141139439373
What memories had he of her adolescence?	1108.8922637191263
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	1767.5367955143863
On the duke’s
lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to
make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	1600.3403627285627
On the vigil of the
15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
not stated).	1413.3104358971036
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	1823.8347994841738
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	1400.9588451566472
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
if differently?	1747.8650798299461
A temporary departure of his cat.	1511.6721431989456
Why similarly, why differently?	1196.3022706333559
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian).	1545.7316417071188
Differently,
because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
habitation.	1836.14942496716
In other respects were their differences similar?	1616.8130420134173
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
unexpectedness.	1085.3190375959578
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
for her (cf neckarching cat).	1841.8818199614786
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
mousewatching cat).	1918.7701684657263
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,
issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	1868.2676792136433
Furthermore, silly Milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a
horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
hearthdreaming cat).	1770.594632535558
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct
of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	1329.9267224372115
In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as
matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	1481.6199724778946
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of
the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and
the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,
_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical
progression.	1912.1930922470249
In what manners did she reciprocate?	1512.1148830138864
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	1436.97399647233
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had
been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
necessities, anticipating his desires.	2082.1354098510164
She admired: a natural
phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the
immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of
his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	1911.683390653697
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,
make to Stephen, noctambulist?	735.3811231526863
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess.	1642.6706840542718
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a
prolongation of such an extemporisation?	1905.350296916136
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study.	1823.845165224177
For the
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
pronunciation.	1275.2360199416953
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?	1984.2440724471287
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
through daughter.	1470.0250359997765
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
return a monosyllabic negative answer?	1845.2255944183241
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at
Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.	765.5947187919072
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	1512.1352658891174
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	1700.220726036232
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	1692.1979060877222
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£
1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
the former.	1479.6908903362978
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	2003.0464395995873
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
residence of the instructed.	1147.8039607002825
To inaugurate a course of vocal
instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	1499.290721256486
To inaugurate a
series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident
in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street
(W.	1216.9060071987365
and E.	592.3640888758189
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions?	1344.9660671432011
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
(the clown’s) papa.	1450.0258239298412
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
received by J.	1431.1984616020716
and T.	592.3640888758189
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
circuitous or direct, return.	1213.5869557028022
Was the clown Bloom’s son?	548.1210609890242
Had Bloom’s coin returned?	1039.4156756356856
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	1767.747463140749
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
international animosity.	2082.7597234515083
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,
eliminating these conditions?	1911.3444510609038
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
maturity to decay.	2160.531051685406
Why did he desist from speculation?	1512.0625039019199
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
to be removed.	1718.487852517393
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	1196.242782536742
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon
the incertitude of the void.	1781.474894687128
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	946.4336915828393
Not verbally.	592.3640888758189
What comforted his misapprehension?	1196.3022706333559
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	1740.1545709040731
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the
exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation
effected?	1648.9110286078615
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN
	592.3640888758197
With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	1700.0372881345131
The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de
populo barbaro_.	800.5917228780926
What did each do at the door of egress?	892.0744224749596
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	754.4908858604938
Stephen put the hat on his
head.	620.0348962423928
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	1436.5431789500553
For a cat.	946.4248011905848
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	1893.1470966029883
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	1767.766837258542
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations?	1347.8597468493356
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of
Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)
distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	1600.3213686539464
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	1767.7661165133352
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of
the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences
concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives
and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the
incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible
molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single
pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white
bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other
bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies
of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component
bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division
till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never
reached.	2215.1746110864574
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	1572.2532228355335
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of
the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such
magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power
of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes
of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would
have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its
printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds
of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of
every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to
the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.	1790.6479509705139
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	1933.4778900962751
Of a different order of difficulty.	1512.1315972910872
Conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the
line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	2013.8222857893534
And the problem of possible redemption?	1197.4823815192922
The minor was proved by the major.	1616.3473401530314
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	1823.2622810904
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin
of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the
birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric
showers about the period of the feast of S.	1546.5639078159104
Lawrence (martyr, 10
August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon
in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the
period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about
the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of
(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about
the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the
constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph
Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of
wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of
nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	1488.5991037257095
His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and
allowing for possible error?	1617.4928497116985
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
a heavenman.	1538.4393670875052
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and
of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in
space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as
a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence.	1826.0444641301265
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	1870.0086496796307
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet.	1979.6136310020233
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?	1874.9342204297288
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	2012.3968281622597
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman?	1530.9579530179046
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,
when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	2346.373732050543
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,
gaze?	946.4314689769473
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and
revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.	1434.5818977115425
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	1506.1961214005598
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
suggestion.	2083.6727388136787
Both then were silent?	1196.3022706333559
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	1824.1900434367499
At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen,
then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual
circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to
the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	1396.9952410745016
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form
of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of
greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the
ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic
consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	1742.7528180568038
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	1545.3703009440103
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	1597.1793818611513
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus
circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain
from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
excrescences as hair and toenails.	1543.0802013939326
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	1700.052917423364
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the
Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	1249.9762632722948
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
departer?	1747.3215281582827
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	2156.995401768251
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	1062.6903813301983
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	1905.1947752375195
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of
their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	1959.268323156805
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the
bells in the church of Saint George.	1050.071565296692
By Stephen:
	592.3640888758189
Liliata rutilantium.	592.3640888758189
Turma circumdet.	592.3640888758189
Iubilantium te virginum.	647.1873352442567
Chorus excipiat.	592.3640888758189
By Bloom:
	592.3640888758189
Heigho, heigho.	592.3640888758189
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
to Glasnevin in the north?	1183.2727377003741
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in
bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),
John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in
bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	593.5026721954657
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	592.3640888758189
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,
the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.	1916.5509097089084
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	592.3640888758189
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the
incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	1567.59471180583
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
him?	1795.710440586809
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	887.4438280047232
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	1767.676761876577
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
apparition of a new solar disk.	1743.2386053103578
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	1767.6138852989848
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of
the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
direction of Mizrach, the east.	1124.9407289324338
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	1376.861144421135
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	2031.6563454867069
Did he remain?	946.4336915828404
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
the passage, reclosing the door.	1651.8023650784419
With brief suspiration he reassumed
the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front
room, hallfloor, and reentered.	1549.6380419915508
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	1185.2789994627644
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	1983.509616474719
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
furniture.	1795.5273063822694
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	1646.339630534567
Describe them.	592.3640888758189
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing
discolouration.	2223.6118004883097
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane
curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat
and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a
bright circle of white plaited rush.	2251.952924738843
What significances attached to these two chairs?	1616.8065327391305
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of
circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	1946.1104901731053
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	1266.8482171281873
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_
(words by G.	1519.9276292760735
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	592.3640888758189
Molloy, sung by Madam
Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
close.	1528.6729979345073
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	1196.2988993571107
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a
large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the
consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration.	2082.5201675728654
His next proceeding?	946.4336915828404
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it
superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
facilitate total combustion.	1965.8055829346802
What followed this operation?	1196.2938424605543
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	2021.648867052002
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece?	1370.782535865539
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m.	762.6310797652554
on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
Alderman John Hooper.	920.1448406563279
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom?	1420.6212637891063
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	1694.0202123956228
Before the
mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	1160.8652556953884
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention?	1377.6077314290053
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	1625.9596240532383
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	946.4292464214541
Brothers and sisters had he none.	1512.1056953996574
Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.	1349.4585209090328
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	946.4292464214541
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	1823.9236353164076
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator.	1871.055152971589
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	1190.5551448119143
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
on the two bookshelves opposite.	1856.358074495304

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
the inverted volumes?	1726.4918355099674
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	2183.627243077176
Which volume was the largest in bulk?	1616.641620681963

The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).	1312.3607837818072
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	1157.1040429423
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to
consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of
the military engagement, Plevna.	1555.8863269103683
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?	1283.6413201499859
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus
purchased by auction from P.	1416.6904687072374
Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.	592.3640888758189
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?	1283.639059293815
Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.	1536.081186016406
How was the irritation allayed?	1376.6451373695359
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table.	1616.4272881062477
He
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,
shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black
hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over
the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the
medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in
circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the
summits of the mammary prominences.	2004.4107697692912
He unbraced successively each of
six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one
incomplete.	2066.5809824088146
What involuntary actions followed?	1196.3022706333559
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice
in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a
sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.	1240.7064534156118
He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
abluted skin.	1927.5008783756873
He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.	1093.774280763432

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and
salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking
repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded
the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his
two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right
sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again
effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic
sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right
foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently
lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part
lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then,
with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	2030.3232885140544
Why with satisfaction?	946.4292464214541
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.	1504.5632951535167

(_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned
in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have
left Kingstown for England).	885.1501696127924
What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	1911.2532890590044
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the
dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social
inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered
with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the
uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to
the crown.	2185.303045612045
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated
by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance
of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all
simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a
preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution),
the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law
merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in
contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass
and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by
desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all
perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of
domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic
connubiality.	2261.239579176788

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	1582.7864738378805
An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the
face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.	1976.8298571591092
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	1089.360667635419
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
beliefs and practices.	1782.75107562553
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male
infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	1921.2222347750171
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	1200.274923592406
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
other beliefs and practices now appeared.	1860.6627282541995
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	833.801417789049
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	1155.8500692411656
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in
the various centres mentioned.	1641.8430241833316
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
migrations in narrator and listener?	1681.9591796661355
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence
of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	1262.5897254043423
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
amnesia?	1823.282107733894
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	1456.0983374954571
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
inclined plate.	1946.0746277117967
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of
food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of
paper.	1690.923541664721
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	1700.0619006452653
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
repletion.	1823.8580150884095
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	1700.0559120080025
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
possession of scrip.	1836.689804338979
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	2088.8799300034057
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.	1692.8398917437025
Mendicancy:
that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in
the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
perforated umbrella.	2004.5112505043464
Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal
Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but
respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight.	1085.922642649835
Nadir of
misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
pauper.	1871.0750922724017
With which attendant indignities?	1196.3022706333559
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the
simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
than nothing.	2239.6941117487195
By what could such a situation be precluded?	1699.999364952908
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	1692.1862405951601
Which preferably?	592.3640888758189
The latter, by the line of least resistance.	1299.2249422145446
What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	1234.363925583089
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.	1700.070883610277
The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.	1616.809787339924
The
necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of
arrest.	1871.0774890473344
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	1103.6589829113161
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
parties, which was impossible.	2272.6885074237903
What considerations rendered departure desirable?	1096.1136280940543

Under what guidance, following what signs?	1512.138816961438
At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior
produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the
rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the
line alpha delta of Ursa Maior.	1642.8860163569093
On land, meridional, a bispherical
moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the
posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose
negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.	1826.3834341651327

departed?	1823.2891459880404
£ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,
missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),

Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman.	1139.5597415895681

immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.	1037.3894546680472
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	1616.8228055439354
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	2141.349006269026
Somewhere
imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
the summons of recall.	1976.3868572124445
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of
peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on
malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial
resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver
king.	1594.8235611111852
What would render such return irrational?	1512.1352658891174
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
time.	1758.4369410319975
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	1767.7640696832195
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of
the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,
desired desire.	1943.7464831025072
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
unoccupied bed?	1782.634102767234
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation
of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in
the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between
the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit
section).	1950.974066500423

accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?	1557.075742494592
The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion

truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank
period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a
leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine
exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina

Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance
medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and
from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).	1235.3171003996908
What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?	1403.9717090163965
The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.	2112.3394576681108
What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering
multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily
apprehending, not comprehend?	1485.854445946063
Who was M’Intosh?	592.3640888758189

years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the
extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?	1500.2543142648992
Where was Moses when the candle went out?	1089.2546196859187
What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,
silently, successively, enumerate?	1755.0601331872847
A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.	974.7404488216162
C.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in
the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous

Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines

Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.	1302.797884100338
What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
perceived by him?	1584.880565948479
A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new
violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on
generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish
cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,
having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its
fore side in white lettering B.	1739.9420643187311
(Brian Cooper Tweedy).	592.3640888758189
What impersonal objects were perceived?	1376.866034962473
A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne
cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat.	1754.1072728249364
Bloom’s acts?	946.4336915828404
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
bed.	1546.011836389532
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
marriage, of sleep and of death.	2207.620778507745
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	1700.0596860310022
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	1834.1752274468292
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	1513.1467994836628
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	1933.3096759186442
What preceding series?	946.4292464214541
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show,
Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of
Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an
unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman
John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a
bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	693.1019852395946
(Blazes) Boylan and so
each and so on to no last term.	1404.1309018424477
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
late occupant of the bed?	1488.722289257148
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
boaster).	2047.6535716704823
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
proportion and commercial ability?	1788.1211622706655
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
comprehension and apprehension.	2032.4608888743783
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected?	1767.7605812837176
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	1196.3022706333559
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse.	2134.688281323468
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
the agent and reagent of attraction.	2066.58307199616
Because attraction between
agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion
of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
reentrance.	2168.3395873269587
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	1845.116849521148
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial
prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current
expenses, net proceeds divided.	1733.1849931893128
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in
accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar
similarity.	2030.5958081578474
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the
planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	1665.8252813486165
As less
reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and
animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,
misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,
contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,
trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion
from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence
with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,
wilful and premeditated murder.	2245.4778821820105
As not more abnormal than all other
parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,
resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and
its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,
indulged inclinations, significant disease.	2239.013960600004
As more than inevitable,
irreparable.	1376.841762631882
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	1767.7688841065128
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated.	1998.9233873730184
What retribution, if any?	1196.2811996701753
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	1823.7789157540951
Duel by
combat, no.	1196.3022706333559
Divorce, not now.	946.415910520381
Exposure by mechanical artifice
(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),
not yet.	1763.8849723776311
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault
with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	2066.6072503332866
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	1376.8650244983396
If any, positively, connivance,
introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of
publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,
alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from
the other, protecting the separator from both.	2171.0926111403055
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	2066.5061278948174
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest
or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of
nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	2107.64047130357
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	1845.445744027241
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	1919.440492462934
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	1185.2656381288991
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	1905.4528416591595
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	2176.8944548130767
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	1185.2656381288991
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	2003.04594968106
What followed this silent action?	1376.8572642759873
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
catechetical interrogation.	1767.7688841065128
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in
the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and
response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
surname unknown.	1062.2619272637721
Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs
Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South
King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36
and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical
tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of
fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement
in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since
completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,
eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an
aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a
witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of
decision and gymnastic flexibility.	1263.9298402487977
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	1616.8260600451579
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	1795.2410748061905
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.	827.4693745262043
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	1853.8669848535872
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz.	1320.6584929762396
8 October, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz.	1242.0814447136104
27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without
ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	1083.9642754312572
By the narrator a
limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete
mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place
since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,
of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there
remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of
a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed.	1653.7357804400267
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
projected or effected.	1744.284701528121
What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible
thoughts?	1782.1796610249928
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.	2038.8273132131828
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?	1548.092933084889
Listener, S.	592.3640888758189
by E.: Narrator, N.	592.3640888758189
by W.: on the 53rd parallel of
latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to
the terrestrial equator.	1123.6679994499218
In motion being
each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by
the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
neverchanging space.	1878.4131159843635
In what posture?	946.4336915828404
Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed.	1714.520740087295
Narrator:
reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,
in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,
the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.	1716.529770166937
He rests.	592.3640888758189
He has travelled.	946.4336915828404
Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and
Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and
Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and
Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.	592.3640888758212
Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc’s
auk’s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of
Darkinbad the Brightdayler.	974.2834268959671
Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when
he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was
actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all
her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and
earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God
help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and
lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was
pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like
her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a
welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here
and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her
dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats
especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that
and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always
if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much
better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I
suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have
a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till
they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as
much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre
sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was
O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day
I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones
she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into
a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying
on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more
like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same
besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor
paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I
was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it
not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by
his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her
so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was
really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it
planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember
Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he
not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and
turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what
harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to
him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever
met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle
in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in
with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as
I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a
letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the
paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the
blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably
that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all
men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is
now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old
fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I
care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though
Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my
nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell
of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by
getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat
without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was
drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of
course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table
on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing
my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if
you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on
with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you
have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters
but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be
alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a
little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave
her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do
out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out
the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I
couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar
and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the
place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because
he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere
and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan
gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there
steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb
to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he
has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out
and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the
satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be
always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking
boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id
confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my
garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I
know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging
drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this
that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would
because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in
the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a
stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and
he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he
is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it
tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine
Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what
he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply
ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it
till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your
lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the
world about it people make its only the first time after that its just
the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man
without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when
you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish
some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in
his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul
almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to
Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and
I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my
child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where
you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done
with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put
it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he
want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat
hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he
Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in
the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never
turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost
for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them
Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense
off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre
married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the
pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt
like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though
I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of
his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it
who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they
stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking
green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with
the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American
that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do
to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took
the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt
lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I
popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful
to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when
I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it
brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to
church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only
grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I
lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that
tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or
whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is
not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my
hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a
thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think
a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life
felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must
have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with
a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into
you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious
look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a
tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on
me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt
washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice
invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if
someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went
through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina
Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up
with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a
smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like
a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the
last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and
bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied
till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what
supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was
married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has
more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting
Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him
off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I
know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing
and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming
and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not
liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over
politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive
about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for
I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he
annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot
of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often
wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family
physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with
her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever
he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me
the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that
finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I
know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out
to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know
plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch
him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them
all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of
course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him
that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love
him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might
imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of
a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it
out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and
wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the
night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I
want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper
with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too
much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know
more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie
whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I
said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash
possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick
when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the
indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was
too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment
she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk
about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes
he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him
just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might
murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes
mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when
he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he
always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and
now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard
U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff
to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than
marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like
me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and
he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick
that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man
yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and
do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating
drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask
us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because
they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off
flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say
its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have
been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being
hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do
besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they

theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it
was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed
breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting
all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long
one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got
after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish
times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to
Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the
turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea
2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him
because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he
meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that
if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill
stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still
I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of
a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to
mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my
stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another
time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I
could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world
that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and
beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because
the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in
the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere
I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell
DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on
the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting
for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown
part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was
always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his
mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a
place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him
about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there
and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it
or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an
idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got
me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me
to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming
along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had
to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape
of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me
when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject
of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced
things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels
even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one
in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see
every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain
I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the
Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the
Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking
slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they
can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on
it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were
you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me
his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it
was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he
pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he
said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an
excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time
till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his
waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in
the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them
and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the
sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet
if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you
never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it
if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers
outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him
from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do
everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting
all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the
butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to
any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we
met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw
I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was
always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky
man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake
dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it
used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in
Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the
same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you
think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the
door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after
dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me
professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in
his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out
you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I
thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches
first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was
trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he
must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2
Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch
he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after
when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty
when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even
put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week
were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers
anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms
at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new
bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next
room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the
wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all
very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we
never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes
going where he is besides something always happens with him the time
going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for
the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with
the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and
the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion
for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two
gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was
too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a
good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd
have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him
O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I
wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the
train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots
of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly
be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone
in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something
about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the
window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what
would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last
concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall
Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen
Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my
singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts
when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him
managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to
sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead
Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out
he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some
old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein
lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and
nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very
intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats
all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I
hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and
Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd
East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and
just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was
lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty
he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the
road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could
have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of
the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of
dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their
fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love
to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish
cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from
Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham
battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the
march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O
the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made
his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me
a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen
up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like
I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going
round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the
knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or
tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go
and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money
and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I
could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when
I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the
expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with
his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat
always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from
behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the
dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so
quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the
way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish
tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly
welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he
was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the
stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20
quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for
me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that
sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming
back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor
looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first
noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I
wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my
fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for
I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers
were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have
slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always
hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down
your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a
great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case
if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one
thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I
think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them
either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she
didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of
silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought
them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one
change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into
him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id
want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips
he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a
delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance
across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill
have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it
the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his
money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a
cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret
that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die
of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that
antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the
fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats
all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was
the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like
new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place
and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to
him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to
wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax
and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the
skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger
after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry
handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world
without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it
around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea
into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues
itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all
the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners
3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the
other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because
they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every
day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all
Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith
shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys
on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down
to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham
street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it
as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the
day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of
Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads
only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black
mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny
story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster
knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and
the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing
like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master
Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her
ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and
her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that
pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody
can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that
twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs
him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a
woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out
of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the
crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have
a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of
her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and
she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar
the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted
the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me
too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to
chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it
and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank
where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day
of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with
him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe
like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching
about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still
only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could
have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada
once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly
Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I
lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming
into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no
good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as
I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot
of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I
went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes
take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in
Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as
insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were
giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of
her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second
time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see
him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for
me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs
Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him
being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled
I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely
sorry and Im sure you were
	1486.5111829012797
yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one
anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep
that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out
for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2
the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up
there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide
it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a
man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down
out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it
with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat
market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the
statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was
pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one
side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved
them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed
outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to
try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7
wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night
coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade
to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting
cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was
a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see
me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it
before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not
afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the
woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for
a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the
job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee
palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes
only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish
photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her
and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent
they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly
enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a
pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly
caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till
he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get
him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker
than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond
everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only
could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it
the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an
hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant
I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those
men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch
myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come
again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when
he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was
coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him
after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or
anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain
who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man
theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice
about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my
eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue
between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday
two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday

frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those
engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and
out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor
men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in
those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half
of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying
about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W
C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there
for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres
last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the
hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and
refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get
like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on
black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big
giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with
the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and
the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time
weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs
Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest
Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name
was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a
jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she
called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing
Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he
bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing
things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you
will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious
currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina
be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also
Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit
married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was
awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to
step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was
given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them
expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic
all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or
jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious
old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2
things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the
women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole
insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all
my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking
in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose
theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes
you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to
myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker
than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up
and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we
were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in
her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning
with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an
opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father
and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the
windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like
all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at
myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the
shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been
nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me
the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East
Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by
that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as
he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave
me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a
Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a
whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards
of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one
decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and
his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my
shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the
chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on
the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them
at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago
it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her
address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were
always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and
the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those
Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything
he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was
blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I
did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a
Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage
made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it
got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run
away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or
aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me
waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and
booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing
everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when
general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great
fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there
from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the
son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums
rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with
messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their
jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men
to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the
gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about
Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum
lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil
with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his
nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner
but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room
on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky
talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along
I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a
letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with
bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails
listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an
instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your
hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me
looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the
opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I
put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a
notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even
youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake
hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half
frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great
intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in
their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms
intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they
were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to
swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of
paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a
poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some
advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam
only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a
letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what
possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the
recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say
she was married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear
with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was
near seventy always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie
theres the piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too
on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that
have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles
that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt
know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor
Nancy its a bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things
and no stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement
symph̸athy I always make that mistake and new̸phew with 2 double yous
in I hope hell write me a longer letter the next time if its a thing he
really likes me O thanks be to the great God I got somebody to give me
what I badly wanted to put some heart up into me youve no chances at
all in this place like you used long ago I wish somebody would write me
a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked
yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff silly women believe love is
sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth
in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something
to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world I
could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few
words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used to write to the
fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out
of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he
could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with
equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans
proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very
fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might
as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit.	1548.7821547777303
Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her
in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles
with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough
in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there
was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black
blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on
Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell
bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an
admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him
up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window
then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making
an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it
up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill
instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps
singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the
old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under
the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what
kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was
sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way
what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish
nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to
be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in
jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about
myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I
suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all
the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and
the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the
black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it
was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in
the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the
rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all
about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail
careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was
a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and
throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that
white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could
without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was
tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be
the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those
frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever
they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots
Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when
they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing
yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever
he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I
was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness
out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last
day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he
wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was
awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me
with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop
even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was
afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once
took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered
with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of
youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with
you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling
there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I
pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I
opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I
had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first
tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt
awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the
same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got
over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back
the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the
middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was
his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was
rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the
whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed
come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed
do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now
flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20
years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put
his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young
still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has
she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever
dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you
might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I
was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in
from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and
pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle
hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to
read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he
hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he
always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso
swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long
preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle
and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and
me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that
would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it
looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M
Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well
its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with
bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I
wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my
mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows
after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along
Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other
side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like
Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down
at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars
pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was
to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world
and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while
they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up
Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that
was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from
on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral
necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay
of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits
like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the
sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at
the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow
for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that
Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on
you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me
that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south
Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they
were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it
like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold
because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that
the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to
the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that
was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if
that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the
heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in
the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill
my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all
night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see
why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter
its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was
only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes
dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those
mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with
the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing
about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite
used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the
summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then
stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the
chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us
goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get
in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again
coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the
manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night
squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink
water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon
haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like
the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down
in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling
up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then
play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has
she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate
their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like
that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I
wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think
Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with
some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb
pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and
Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes
Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting
anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin
chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck
the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or
let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and
drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him
examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters
no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed
sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks
there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday
anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit
Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the
seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after
him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked
could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it
came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all
down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the
tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping
out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of
course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his
flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all
the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was
black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was
no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that
book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other
Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with
his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white
shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather
all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell
of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan
bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the
fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa
and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to
climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago
besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at
night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of
salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was
going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or
Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the
way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he
was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely
places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the
gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of
and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was
going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry
my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the
plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old
beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and
put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of
that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in
jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine
his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles
away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows
to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a
madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute
like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed
Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better
than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and
he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was
looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits
making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit
there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling
especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl
down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather
instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not
like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the
same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way
he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the
place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming
in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as
I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then
doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to
look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack
statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got
that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2
shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right
not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at
the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to
understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant
say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and
helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its
me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on
the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now
shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me
whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly
come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her
round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well
he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to
go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I
smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I
sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I
tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a
parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out
no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your
blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle
blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on
show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at
her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you
then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me
afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that
touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always
trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for
Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed
like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me
there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to
get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same
little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but
he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the
Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands
swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything
deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into
the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that
Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with
sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he
looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and
supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man
gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it
really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love
in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each
other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit
foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and
poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes
always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to
put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time
enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes
pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too
but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a
fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we
met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to
see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough
till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that
now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me
that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because
how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night
before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to
leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as
she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was
the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself
they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the
two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever
going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming
Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that
old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the
things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course
shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly
dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something
and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends
to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you
please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father
such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the
cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at
the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won
them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody
saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand
funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody
hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head
I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been
hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the
ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was
something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and
now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband
getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they
have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats
her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres
some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead
in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if
Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt
that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he
had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that
pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows
theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual
monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like
that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him
to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about
insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt
give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his
glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul
thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could
all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it
out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry
supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery
hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a
woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up
for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is
better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience
above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me
pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just
put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn
it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a
virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you
could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do
or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this
pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what
between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too
jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the
other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor
with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think
it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I
might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next
time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face
wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me
after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I
made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse
and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be
he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits
easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling
like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for
a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning
dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look
how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit
here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get
up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey
lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore

who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when
was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to
the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that
white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick
Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called
it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting
round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every
little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of
course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last
man in the world besides theres something queer about their children
always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what
I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one
thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly
old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and
could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the
rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by
the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I
can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and
needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by
Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the
same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and
asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all
the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked
sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows
what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out
frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you
lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever
enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad
crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious
Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and
of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he
had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I
hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him
up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited
me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in
Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes
as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking
after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half
sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand
for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his
blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool
of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O
beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and
rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy
anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st
opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom
pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk
and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight
sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so
that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose
there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at
the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard
bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth
breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to
show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a
pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out
that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put
together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody
I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big
square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway
wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt
creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere
still she must have given him great value for his money of course he
has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll
have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God
help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always
reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often
enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to
admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like
my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses
were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard
street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on
the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the
men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse
and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always
somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always
know who was in there last every time were just getting on right
something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr
Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old
lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives
impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along
in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres
Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well
thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody
climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that
little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if
he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I
dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their
lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont
believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats
Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in
real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is
disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads
and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about
with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow
poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both
sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let
him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the
one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews
used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast
or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough
for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his
own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that
wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and
lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder
was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too
no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants
me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that
forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some
little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the
College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his
nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at
those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no
use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr
Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in
the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd
be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind
in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that
bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or
other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys
husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye
trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old
green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way
like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call
that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with
their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping
that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be
sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still
though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of
them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches
if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well
when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to
squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after
his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im
sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do
unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some
pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come
home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully
becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at
the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he
borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and
squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a
wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough
that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the
preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and
Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the
second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly
sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying
too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had
a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart
_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_
goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in
it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we
sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even
transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed
say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I
wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a
university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he
driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have
got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look
young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and
me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge
station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago
now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for
what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for
me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted
hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time
he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord
Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw
him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God
yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out
the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met
before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either
besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after
that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on
its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise
in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look
at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about
poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only
getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry
when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not
an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I
wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose
hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not
that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of
course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was
out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not
a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson
they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont
find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back
there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that
for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly
bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young
star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to
talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts
ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in
their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like
to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young
those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace
from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or
something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men
like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely
little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and
his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and
poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his
lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth
if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and
white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if
some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no
danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I
suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the
most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age
Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard
comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out
Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew
who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the
same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him
till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and
mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he
becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though
	1453.6602018659178
no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because
I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a
cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so
barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a
butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course
hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its
because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he
couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the
amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white
for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with
that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so
soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those
cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has
a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it
didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts
his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be
you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick
and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl
for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street
no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me
up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands
jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling
her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if
he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he
going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course
the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either
its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all
those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can
I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with
him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the
wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a
womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything
unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of
us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the
dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita
theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a
madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young
no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the
fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking
would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd
know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not
care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of
those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near
the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only
sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back
over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow
with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me
up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do
themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us
the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course
it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and
when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after
coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his
wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten
again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the
love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well
he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he
knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to
sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for
Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around
down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like
to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I
dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be
governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one
another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around
drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on
horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop
sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know
what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they
all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I
never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away
from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the
usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a
fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to
make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two
dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in
that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some
poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it
was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into
the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I
felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of
roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and
pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining
himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to
love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends
they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some
woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder
they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I
suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like
that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I
suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the
next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I
wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had
the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave
me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and
Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown
myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the
bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and
Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am
a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day
older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish
como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all
I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person
place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs
Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the
two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the
Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant
what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and
wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in
bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad
luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and
something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might
like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the
criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you
see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself
not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend
we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is
dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head
sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres
the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his
writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he
does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes
making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to
take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house
like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated
person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with
the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown
that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long
ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill
get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I
might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and
tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in
lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out
looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the
night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt
in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw
him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his
mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do
Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa
pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son
piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good
eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if
thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked
too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the
mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it
out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly
unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell
him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right
its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery
said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of
tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I
suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt
have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to
kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his
face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes
there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill
tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he
wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women
do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write
his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it
up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided
he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill
do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes
like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill
tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick
my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest
about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and
friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing
pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of
plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better
itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there
thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me
just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up
at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only
way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just
getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well
soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil
their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the
alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself
let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those
they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much
nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it
twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill
go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some
flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow
today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place
up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can
have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the
keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or
those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7
1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky
sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the
table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I
love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of
heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and
the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats
and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about
that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all
sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the
ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no
God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or
whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves
first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why
because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes
I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there
was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so
there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising
tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the
rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat
the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of
seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago
my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a
flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that
was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today
yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a
woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the
pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I
wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was
thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and
Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all
birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the
pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing
round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls
laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the
morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who
else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market
all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half
asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the
steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle
thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and
turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop
and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice
hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night
and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the
watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown
torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the
glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all
the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and
the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and
Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put
the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a
red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well
as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again
yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could
feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and
yes I said yes I will Yes.	1480.1553643638154
