PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	227.5647962113789
CHAPTER I.	227.5647962113789
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	149.2959183466525
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	161.3086287212876
"My dear Mr.	237.42144067154763
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"
	150.65966950430177
Bennet replied that he had not.	60.75367874733351
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.	120.1748940713904
Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."
	118.68703563753847
Bennet made no answer.	118.54727678557937
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	150.50771727719322
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
	142.950849061782
This was invitation enough.	119.23658560490793
Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.	159.8663678539657
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."
	117.67853728283833
"What is his name?"
	85.68450758201605
"Is he married or single?"
	154.7213798840628
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.	243.6843647501798
What a fine thing for our girls!"
	154.60185381152203
"How so?	42.68377461012516
"My dear Mr.	237.42144067154763
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
	177.65212161757944
"Is that his design in settling here?"
	159.73919891727556
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."
	155.95881175741846
"I see no occasion for that.	101.15726010723621
Bingley might like you the best of the
party."
	85.5038403748137
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	198.39027073390747
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
	133.34228771456844
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.	148.1665536155331
Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."
	124.50524353817184
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
	268.33053359183634
"But consider your daughters.	174.57046676947814
Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	101.12885496583677
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."
	110.22881932807623
"You are over scrupulous surely.	382.7470227023494
I dare say Mr.	294.77067487856
Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
	168.15975268704514
"I desire you will do no such thing.	125.71842743400114
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia.	194.01322527794665
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference."
	172.56517393674753
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."
	182.35718463853854
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	152.57224332785518
You take
delight in vexing me.	227.23472037238795
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."
	189.91543322295192
"You mistake me, my dear.	145.97987153559137
I have a high respect for your nerves.	176.28566755267698
They
are my old friends.	170.99419558125513
I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."
	212.8336681418698
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all."
	168.05815187174943
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	230.14126742183464
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	217.82717986984272
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	195.2932183432932
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	214.29894738601098
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	165.7267723328097
CHAPTER II.	227.5647962113789
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.	200.69804898541418
He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	118.8901861329896
It was then disclosed in the following
manner.	139.20325263135004
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,
	239.24038710989
Bingley will like it Lizzy."
	169.91981841432033
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.	143.35088720721745
Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
	176.36684505700242
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs.	212.70706309731142
Long has promised to introduce him."
	139.3532513565534
"I do not believe Mrs.	168.5539973177136
Long will do any such thing.	106.38994215513901
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."
	161.67398674136652
"No more have I," said Mr.	252.8681121707254
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."
	137.37259391239468
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	191.83197039252445
You tear them to pieces."
	240.84193684163483
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."
	171.49776274149428
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.	319.54251289596425
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"
	142.79834062048778
Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."
	111.73804707668594
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr.	128.95249916885314
Bingley to _her_."
	71.40566161209483
"Impossible, Mr.	227.5647962113789
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"
	182.71486913540684
"I honour your circumspection.	256.4578407473882
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	167.41627024802676
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	109.62951299350337
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs.	252.97953959965568
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."
	177.22216647553475
The girls stared at their father.	203.65597041236512
Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"
	311.9733979253919
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.	160.0955331875445
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	163.3997284223323
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	212.72868985494833
What say you,
Mary?	165.7110312096598
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	147.42553440697628
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.	294.03374593261105
Bingley," cried his wife.	110.20287583374204
If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.	183.80069651336342
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."
	209.11804923376488
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	120.27208583139159
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.	98.85574762311964
Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last.	375.80144517463486
I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	175.18482349661335
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."
	146.4020374645924
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr.	226.32457750946276
Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	109.73382791984142
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	140.4967135028475
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	146.37365137629345
Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr.	300.64194680666185
Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."
	110.47368558383569
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."
	515.9001960942629
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr.	173.43970997118097
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	153.7186863942392
CHAPTER III.	227.5647962113789
Not all that Mrs.	127.09970734672288
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr.	179.12882404713713
They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas.	311.7277590319737
Her report was highly favourable.	249.7578573461293
Sir William had been
delighted with him.	145.7604454817619
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	172.1956828563033
Bingley's heart were entertained.	179.21825755518464
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."
	129.58339853698794
In a few days Mr.	198.60058064686137
Bingley returned Mr.	317.3543035050128
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	149.6117091660201
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	136.1785470974292
The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	282.12752341974027
Bennet was quite
disconcerted.	163.49843884121287
She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	144.1544572421492
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.	195.8771168813011
Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	152.96376396291757
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	194.55014463680794
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr.	239.44820923579096
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	118.11423354382367
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	188.449142394998
His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	248.7738849254025
His brother-in-law, Mr.	229.9138765189875
Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.	182.48616867578696
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr.	175.04067687382906
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.	186.0736411720448
Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	263.1681204390415
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr.	167.8106624251016
Darcy danced
only once with Mrs.	283.1000860492886
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	167.07230916130004
His character was decided.	149.35810710713918
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	141.20856088874118
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.	174.68582019280137
Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	215.236032958365
Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr.	166.772413303
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	124.78277036463172
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	204.02109830229003
I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	199.25955847189357
You had much better
dance."
	134.08570685897445
"I certainly shall not.	101.83583143890357
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	359.07751957849536
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	140.8491310241724
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."
	116.38304646320736
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."
	213.71814880369809
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.	153.50065936350182
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	297.55922057863285
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."
	164.87104032002452
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
	159.54004088265813
Bingley followed his advice.	184.1774427283676
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	249.9542133851973
She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	219.9399451712323
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	221.8573563086723
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.	197.87459484897894
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	117.55040634557038
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	117.02116352175995
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure.	229.16915411136205
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	169.8806514257045
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	175.3473044636082
They found Mr.	287.5101858075124
Bennet still up.	132.67771288124413
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	139.73677075489775
He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	142.90074263560422
"Oh! my dear Mr.	165.58392730803058
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	137.6580503978077
I wish you had been there.	81.09520241545918
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	114.7779673710152
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr.	162.47738898664477
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	158.59963131676983
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	119.4668638567183
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	201.14199465486735
I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.	146.7889628499261
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	123.92550203529076
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"
	238.9954748398778
"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his partners.	198.3072340343892
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"
	138.05042986902413
"Oh! my dear," continued Mrs.	209.78064977044536
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.	200.07202807998857
He
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	189.09326528292104
I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	195.51015245104566
I dare say the
lace upon Mrs.	313.9587206631506
Hurst's gown----"
	148.94534126830249
Here she was interrupted again.	105.48635134467126
Bennet protested against any
description of finery.	327.2850824211622
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.	225.69783602623258
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	243.00678160319592
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	202.49213078103148
CHAPTER IV.	227.5647962113789
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr.	199.08010982224798
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	120.11895768254274
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"
	211.48904058017314
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	202.26083458391398
His character is thereby complete."
	321.15860234921263
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	144.55997572898943
"Did not you?	38.111773548139425
_I_ did for you.	58.94325049042848
But that is one great difference between
us.	167.04788140370255
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	202.23309370377277
He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	142.35959608553966
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	109.58624392300604
You have liked many a
stupider person."
	224.21383981908184
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	147.69229537801962
You never see a fault in any body.	142.8448745562915
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	106.2753692071572
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."
	144.68744974948933
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think."
	212.72991495158186
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	235.17151800855027
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	151.52432589766156
"Certainly not; at first.	66.50791900505409
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	171.22459436888283
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."
	164.2123217912928
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	159.15777270952216
They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	180.0857136251851
They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	169.91439350257522
They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	197.5078481070835
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr.	228.69711695161672
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	169.66646941104347
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	200.2295788317767
Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House.	219.84899895936286
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	208.650705396368
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	201.20985587595686
In
understanding Darcy was the superior.	200.4485765703388
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever.	201.16799977914502
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	193.83042808875666
Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	301.83507205501155
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	193.6724390263192
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	167.84996607841936
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	165.24783708968565
Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	181.91522946521965
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.	224.69914062679433
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	237.39670809193072
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	265.73786172492134
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	196.44701960989028
By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St.	425.17967370527253
James's had made him
courteous.	145.57031643708882
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs.	173.9229434752293
Bennet.--They had several children.	305.5383852330956
The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	309.05864633548094
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	187.27127688542808
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.	249.09091198016557
"_You_ were Mr.	176.9445286651943
Bingley's first choice."
	151.75645447227316
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."
	119.20200882051682
"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.	279.9132769200105
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr.	296.8809060924982
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.	278.25932679160667
Robinson; did not
I mention it to you?	114.71870108694364
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	193.94981890065378
and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."
	256.4418689415644
"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."
	152.36426350469796
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte.	315.4307522856995
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."
	177.4606045144027
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	148.15473908314846
Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."
	195.81723587065898
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr.	289.59124513885894
Darcy speaking to her."
	60.757891181594566
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."
	151.52417972858456
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	310.46890405412694
With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."
	235.1387758888344
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	83.74672818422796
If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	116.54531512000331
But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs.	240.13035896908974
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."
	138.47776383281865
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	130.56054739652504
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."
	322.1016812567161
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."
	222.43282677556746
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."
	315.68300085797216
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	255.99007718279177
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	162.43934640081247
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."
	165.94308444750877
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
	294.55239499374176
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.	321.21340234860173
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	243.18128878715973
A person may be
proud without being vain.	220.94287145756098
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
	167.67122968940234
"If I were as rich as Mr.	263.3537487845498
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	243.17111468400347
I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."
	239.84482474945256
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.	179.30627537807186
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly."
	190.51823130890537
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	144.501654257384
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	249.84732603649437
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs.	233.69796960102985
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	166.07689617693472
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	187.24712846508714
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	151.3098183864716
She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas.	213.6132038327033
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	153.26112646711718
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	145.34834283365797
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	139.62133276517878
We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	200.87094391061257
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	328.7367779864913
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
	149.79726742044056
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."
	160.33367501213007
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
	162.04502238547693
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."
	121.23448780011886
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	98.52274578065713
But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	237.5014664415389
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."
	133.27331699299117
But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	183.30531561933194
She has known him only a fortnight.	136.14803682175497
She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	209.20453937288747
"Not as you represent it.	97.15368483344591
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."
	206.1035065363418
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
	319.2736352809484
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	158.54578011066553
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	141.12992553872988
If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	178.97341430002774
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."
	152.15180864805532
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	178.7315283005321
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
	121.49561798117374
Occupied in observing Mr.	240.89476167046703
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	132.6329684208042
But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	161.7042892450571
To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	434.3554209898351
Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	183.44088021505175
Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	121.732895948397
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	118.2267360543815
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	297.1851112040008
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"
	220.3559740543298
"That is a question which Mr.	157.11550923412648
Darcy only can answer."
	135.79693217642333
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about.	174.0292871130283
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
	267.149609935282
"Did not you think, Mr.	125.79932897912566
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"
	349.3979564910749
"You are severe on us."
	165.38605126145183
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.	258.8359400881738
"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
	176.26985192692007
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
at Mr.	242.89638871107812
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."
	338.28564781528877
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	242.92557940771172
After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	179.97537434872078
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	238.4354999043491
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	190.54263988183885
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	246.7996731541228
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.	217.77032275719017
Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."
	249.46311293429088
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
dance."
	259.91419292164744
Sir William only smiled.	326.31157541727265
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.	292.52501263599856
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."
	427.9450777298143
Do
you often dance at St.	202.73844080222102
James's?"
	40.77723074686394
"Never, sir."
	85.98333208974564
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
	88.54920112481373
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
	217.0960149386247
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"
	198.7795032280485
Darcy bowed.	267.31513728086935
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."
	270.327135313394
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,
	163.9394816004469
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.	349.0005535504647
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.	192.25313432314724
Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,
	218.57623491072854
"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
	239.93628767585926
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	274.0382213080273
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."
	196.83456597801265
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	268.62299043329034
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"
	211.5858368940114
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	229.93184603172278
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,
	196.17309535190878
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."
	165.26560818208046
"I should imagine not."
	111.9012059625371
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	188.09503563124454
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	398.5068774389699
My mind was more
agreeably engaged.	221.32374624977135
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
	165.53534438192887
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	193.2563136739899
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,
	205.7545830626508
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
	532.9036398671572
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.	1051.6663630485602
"I am all astonishment.	118.60986900299714
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
joy?"
	158.0648946063931
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	168.62699453652644
A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	190.76642833954426
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	198.78670423860083
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."
	122.8812480801759
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	178.1985897934404
CHAPTER VII.	227.5647962113789
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	185.49695571443067
She had a sister married to a Mr.	106.54846729920644
Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.	147.56771860235344
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	242.9645904197863
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters.	178.9396794447119
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	181.4702777438966
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.	162.05030903205207
Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	151.71937836405993
Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	195.03691102499192
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.	152.82209825547895
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	189.1222137278922
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.	244.79562758946986
Bennet coolly observed,
	367.72509989852796
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	149.3928157428933
I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."
	201.9220338121416
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.	209.8911390472321
Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	135.73899915401162
If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."
	151.22489744038373
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
	117.71488757752014
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	190.5250347740438
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."
	277.3874240780888
"My dear Mr.	237.42144067154763
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	167.55692586567602
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."
	280.7582162661054
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	211.4698614753543
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
	190.36467769749277
"Well, Jane, who is it from?	126.273038931361
what is it about?	67.02296843848048
what does he say?	99.64209314237296
Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
	260.30077556404547
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	264.3751016860823
"My dear Friend,
	237.42144067154763
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
	117.31815570157316
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
	136.09884071363604
lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
	265.2639903845555
end without a quarrel.	140.95739626920565
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
	82.43636487255542
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	94.79366061440528
Yours ever,
	71.38851616836901
"CAROLINE BINGLEY."
	227.5647962113789
"With the officers!" cried Lydia.	190.50904023799575
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."
	154.59895578006797
"Dining out," said Mrs.	212.0004126607545
Bennet, "that is very unlucky."
	100.44259798494355
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.	207.9162880872638
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."
	175.41083963139678
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."
	138.31779532021628
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr.	123.40294024528183
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
	171.5503885921453
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	225.01552994017797
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr.	203.2461267103612
Bennet, are not they?"
	61.53488998558643
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
	248.56097888611444
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."
	160.3474237948746
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	153.658887083053
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	268.9756214162981
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	120.82514282393618
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.	306.9528037514804
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.	213.55375413001414
Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	126.76772898076376
Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	105.38183317135727
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:
	247.51794142884597
"My dearest Lizzy,
	397.3960286238901
My kind friends will
	155.8331699250774
not hear of my returning home till I am better.	241.37802669020127
They insist also on
	228.0677539495061
my seeing Mr.	295.2546620191616
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
	139.93496904361743
of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
	211.50778429171285
there is not much the matter with me.	75.79811036517818
"Yours, &c."
	146.4243853288062
"Well, my dear," said Mr.	158.21714221643805
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr.	180.70831176780575
Bingley, and under your orders."
	147.03279994152336
"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	150.98625132574782
People do not die of little
trifling colds.	251.25996027785297
She will be taken good care of.	122.64238847714
I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage."
	118.95082740169828
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	117.71659802531788
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
	209.68954959248464
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"
	129.08905297056464
"No, indeed.	80.37223535851616
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	101.1660275840718
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	210.50051079898103
I shall be back by dinner."
	148.68122764042462
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
	219.23549710809178
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	247.66534623190117
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	336.8420749892106
She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.	181.48815118950085
Darcy said very
little, and Mr.	131.13373888232783
Hurst nothing at all.	74.66065101008988
The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	187.17044006640143
The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	144.85686557028535
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	183.23821364769384
Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	167.017165661754
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	168.798467998611
She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	217.6171008447363
Elizabeth silently attended
her.	227.55910501464098
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane.	186.042196151643
The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	174.01784276025364
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	159.7931592612624
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	202.19187842674458
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present.	208.66370367389828
CHAPTER VIII.	227.5647962113789
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	319.502598547216
To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr.	181.90467656147965
Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	107.88086342502855
Jane was by no means better.	99.36549864981654
The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	212.21945725221914
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	124.8468468578485
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	163.07074823278347
She had very little notice from any but him.	109.32389945198635
Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr.	342.68124039796305
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.	124.90151519805066
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	168.05008040019746
Hurst
thought the same, and added,
	88.17801207789242
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	169.04404580384846
She really
looked almost wild."
	289.4931108887673
"She did indeed, Louisa.	240.54318378455125
I could hardly keep my countenance.	193.88990222522182
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"
	463.5493709562838
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	290.70795505074597
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."
	525.3686594998796
"_You_ observed it, Mr.	221.73142512982133
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."
	260.519152415117
"Certainly not."
	31.38911042200984
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it?	250.0353425304883
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."
	255.93676706858759
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.	181.4806185720761
"I am afraid, Mr.	252.94427367894173
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."
	284.1416894042795
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	255.19528312361044
Hurst began again.	128.9174250720334
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	216.67132121359788
But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it."
	150.5446995413748
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."
	202.41239807458638
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
	283.30467317639506
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	203.63857034268793
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."
	314.3057160416346
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	210.76266510463262
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	259.04094975509906
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	186.8777652685067
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	153.74387679510798
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	175.35773494623825
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	102.41513017973419
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."
	203.23414427521124
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.	1146.7380972659766
She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."
	161.63374179716575
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
	372.71381803876994
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."
	227.68986782404696
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	209.17970442871015
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	211.814672869654
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into."
	290.33664472969366
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	129.72969665272
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr.	281.75170782269913
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."
	117.75947875645004
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."
	155.06596000862837
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	191.94005746663805
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."
	266.5521776608358
"I wish it may."
	90.77441128057653
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	198.03901083194538
There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."
	243.35152816448107
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
	423.25410065126835
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
	287.2496467679096
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."
	300.1900366253244
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.	207.87138800961108
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"
	349.96075378151113
"I think she will.	69.39784132001681
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."
	482.84593882606555
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	223.78215949945024
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."
	272.0451439767779
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."
	162.56108314145047
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
	309.25915774624326
"Yes, all of them, I think.	123.45809999461899
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	756.6354500133136
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."
	173.06528922369498
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth.	268.8818301109172
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	179.8314147337954
I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."
	187.7315259783228
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.	529.5571568500266
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."
	203.5352644139183
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."
	159.03001005048807
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	317.39263863233305
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."
	190.1333387615859
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	366.2429457661131
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."
	284.96658082885295
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"
	139.2828815083304
"_I_ never saw such a woman.	115.71818938131463
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."
	224.78792114758926
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr.	291.8676942331646
Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	209.63340077205427
As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	218.94352697653324
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds.	236.5754687177877
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."
	186.3361238655405
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	339.4775920475106
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	154.15458726217298
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	96.47298848112189
Bingley urged Mr.	505.5061859508849
Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	203.40935677818032
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr.	115.28211635558168
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	187.49781122931185
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	228.49262806016634
CHAPTER IX.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr.	120.61944178281648
Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	179.02981018145275
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	289.36510573135513
Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	280.0084641485215
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	329.4938494916087
She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	187.8711822813845
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	223.96860853385755
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs.	203.18138148485173
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	262.38952074653173
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.	193.63482764100277
"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	126.12532922275504
Jones says we must not think of moving her.	135.928034632543
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."
	193.19085396316754
"Removed!" cried Bingley.	269.7012237294353
"It must not be thought of.	66.00629036620262
My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."
	162.6479620270323
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."
	374.4306997260724
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	167.24333467465124
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.	159.34454882783064
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	162.0935426329204
You have a sweet room here, Mr.	226.5506400282721
I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield.	108.61040742282887
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease."
	155.53882182570467
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes.	274.38639349873597
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
	335.726166233652
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	190.3723410622103
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.	162.63934355943255
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly."
	288.5606639571009
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."
	226.99624932015755
"That is as it happens.	97.01509917079503
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
	247.2642404340767
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	168.45820824772915
It must be an amusing study."
	214.49188179623255
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	369.46394352506485
They have at
least that advantage."
	105.82572797724829
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	250.58265592012847
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."
	212.0249100564158
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."
	162.75299955051273
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.	287.27460118738117
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."
	110.09183292738724
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	198.63064388610044
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	232.72332388663287
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.	230.90402130220232
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	151.49077367931304
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
	205.00160551862726
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	106.41051546465195
But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."
	138.78694178886414
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	263.935672895231
"You quite mistook Mr.	548.4999947760082
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	207.6257540852669
I know we dine with four and twenty families."
	224.31118391409362
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance.	281.035529949866
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr.	255.23735959364794
Darcy with a very expressive smile.	152.61270097685787
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	220.76822953837006
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	123.45188644440668
What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr.	406.8558479756426
Bingley--is not he?	45.65444451329228
so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."
	233.69102706038427
"No, she would go home.	107.05809302341623
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	249.23940591077945
For
my part, Mr.	214.39615397504872
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	338.7345972236539
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."
	258.2716026564544
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	253.22357823551786
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	125.42519980089142
Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	262.58894849028746
I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	169.69236685565014
It is what every body says.	147.41192539560322
I do not trust my own
partiality.	164.49945050719896
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	135.22319715603834
Perhaps he thought her too young.	100.56961741604867
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.	331.2280283081728
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	187.27301316600324
I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
	289.5894257894629
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.	194.01931269220594
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	262.51267472570083
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	285.9490724275378
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
	255.03495507391742
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	306.99370685197476
She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	139.25477335192062
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.	254.90259937507358
Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	220.9382510350828
Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	172.3452717292654
She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	307.8781746664237
Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	160.5711290562566
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	189.34306680342627
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	157.92691122360904
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	229.24530037129801
She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	196.2825455817946
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr.	197.42804464960022
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	122.46105917789251
His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	205.98962605488475
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	170.79438926459102
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."
	103.44817477009248
Lydia declared herself satisfied.	239.96686253252483
"Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.	196.14909039335438
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.	257.6568739150192
I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
	193.69857988545053
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr.	172.4332178937467
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	210.58740948254118
Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	196.00238772705282
The loo table, however, did not appear.	269.95917317826195
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	219.62810111293726
Hurst and Mr.	114.8481004092976
Hurst was observing their game.	193.98163207215964
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	244.6727229290798
The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	189.22519893620452
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
	203.7058425890491
He made no answer.	118.54727678557937
"You write uncommonly fast."
	439.7464386092567
"You are mistaken.	128.06171607932524
I write rather slowly."
	350.2056901979878
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"
	213.6087327820386
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."
	171.21724819833773
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
	133.42412100998294
"I am afraid you do not like your pen.	158.63221662984267
Let me mend it for you.	101.42384316049947
I mend
pens remarkably well."
	588.709875865279
"Thank you--but I always mend my own."
	202.9484538260129
"How can you contrive to write so even?"
	153.38589922145187
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's."
	219.71509603386932
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
present I have not room to do them justice."
	272.363679895702
"Oh! it is of no consequence.	72.93711192976632
I shall see her in January.	135.89361097869354
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."
	149.3245109601075
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."
	176.364370874961
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	209.98465264185978
He studies too much for
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"
	320.04475870852053
"My style of writing is very different from yours."
	209.7409597415383
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	556.2534484183416
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
	238.02922750874887
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
	252.74789362856671
"Your humility, Mr.	527.2556314119288
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
	482.26804432874314
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	214.66485639900043
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."
	240.4634117094759
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
	190.70721125825023
"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	230.59775910332644
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"
	175.97882686350616
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	151.9082626552852
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment.	208.4868667143981
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."
	266.7531151939092
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	172.377370450253
Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."
	185.56501060899583
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.	238.0535303672511
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	121.91105079439781
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	234.2464600543244
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."
	204.03408265374094
"Would Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
	215.50860947119932
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself."
	305.67315137163746
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged.	214.28665462960984
Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."
	200.88092879817444
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."
	169.1093387458236
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."
	175.9791789302117
"You appear to me, Mr.	165.56642383493283
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	120.83243618430707
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	218.37503985607074
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr.	160.8377380870127
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	256.75264388571895
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
	162.67714547045193
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"
	189.91048681897897
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	244.19636336438182
I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	222.1689001339648
I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."
	213.00336816465622
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	213.2832481117881
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	256.93938982435634
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."
	259.5062086975198
"Perhaps I do.	196.59492397859844
Arguments are too much like disputes.	226.61523710937823
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
	210.03937380725841
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.	208.1222343717321
Darcy had much better finish his letter."
	157.4657640552699
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	166.58967495787124
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	199.4591836048562
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	249.32224062175928
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.	267.17070889105247
The supposition did not pain her.	160.34654062999184
Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--
	175.70723762550531
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"
	244.56978933561015
She smiled, but made no answer.	158.99981972081034
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	154.161648947864
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	172.36055509510393
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	251.2415507406872
"Indeed I do not dare."
	190.6088205519645
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	167.61424607699055
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	231.99100439114997
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."
	222.1841366434222
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
	186.27321026966496
"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	229.96562917558674
Put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	132.25568427158373
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
	190.92754744964176
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."
	230.29397418653141
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.	198.50333854571204
Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.	131.961851044085
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	210.6679387761345
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.	518.5108520544607
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr.	308.15317961147736
The path just admitted three.	454.8019852940528
Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--
	170.7954033850712
We had better go into the
avenue."
	163.79415495922518
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,
	196.1355110476466
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	376.63075139453724
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	165.39075868214934
CHAPTER XI.	227.5647962113789
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	189.23594725799643
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	210.61869135690083
They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	302.77007417438426
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	195.02927867048925
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.	452.63771661738303
Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	211.65177992421198
He was full of joy and
attention.	117.2551710201538
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	152.78398455302323
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	141.95670709487757
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	166.59007902553898
When tea was over, Mr.	257.3009583775897
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	147.63323375011308
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.	353.8058271393468
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.	165.83078031550008
Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	369.7111839601895
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	116.44773164640887
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	130.15029472212439
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.	259.68104610859956
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.	237.11553022381278
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	245.24279443525495
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."
	220.25364029625192
No one made any reply.	154.0793473403874
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,
	258.1886329913702
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."
	207.2425896316765
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards."
	226.16459840187946
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	216.29365526362028
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."
	178.02121795617035
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."
	196.7991405889919
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	185.19580005475393
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	239.5174895529493
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."
	242.82636443389725
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	171.54362877952224
He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	199.2313315128561
"What could he mean?	93.66166812263235
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."
	142.7765300620871
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.	346.37774778909835
Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	186.435268842551
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	116.76990408109428
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."
	220.41401007379457
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley.	676.3528076752646
"I never heard any thing so
abominable.	179.96493650356632
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
	165.58796892026828
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.	143.97730690476146
"We
can all plague and punish one another.	223.4437921723211
Teaze him--laugh at
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
	109.2262362550267
"But upon my honour I do _not_.	307.7559134153547
I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	188.42248293194692
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no--I feel he may defy us there.	289.37049402754275
Darcy may hug himself."
	270.0499455477348
Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.	132.08800068711724
"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	177.62564048293976
I dearly love a
laugh."
	259.95115305741194
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	164.29132493725157
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.	258.10238677971097
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	289.2749104500964
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without."
	426.6404488446283
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	83.978579418068
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."
	206.70128333450964
"Such as vanity and pride."
	111.11357651443991
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	190.1526952147523
But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
	239.29129129128805
"Your examination of Mr.	278.4055118743788
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"
	306.5152974079596
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.	169.99643805279675
Darcy has no defect.	164.8253026678794
He owns it
himself without disguise."
	292.08195829089715
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.	302.1655609118812
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	184.7452198482629
My temper I dare not vouch
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	280.6618483562492
I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	278.46771205973573
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."
	317.20580038037883
"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.	253.9005968225634
"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	229.64627997561496
But you have chosen your fault well.--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	261.9230177238929
You are safe from me."
	146.5953006906112
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
	253.44882510115895
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."
	254.19683207384253
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."
	182.6285805401708
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr.	245.02136307858936
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	171.9064583929642
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	212.01685312449658
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	127.15282337469067
Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	250.41386034916633
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	165.4914580432328
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.	159.91171098511177
Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr.	283.62662148843845
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	173.44716961750842
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	161.2953299840499
To Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.	229.43183785083755
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	223.78753447618942
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	237.28465587882653
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	161.1433224732917
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	206.86759772435403
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	196.25940994385164
Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	188.40421356045405
The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.	195.5002463493465
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	299.8896170585664
Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	134.96141921203505
Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.	178.82471359091323
CHAPTER XIII.	227.5647962113789
"I hope, my dear," said Mr.	176.79420988442322
Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
	156.53475652291309
"Who do you mean, my dear?	100.81355831010512
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	265.72816910715954
I do not believe she often sees such at home."
	152.15431526032344
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	198.33614330352827
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.	343.5007456648419
Bingley
I am sure.	207.90868216428515
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.	305.058051824363
Bingley.--But--good
lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	188.71567551222785
Lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	185.56665485855345
I must speak to Hill, this moment."
	173.51298722789085
"It is _not_ Mr.	293.78887102194534
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	166.72566506031146
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	261.3628563506959
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	262.32462675108417
It is from my cousin, Mr.	165.45316392457252
Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."
	183.00427146333817
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	192.88941713309123
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	133.3248491448693
I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."
	180.66551269738306
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	154.6335239732678
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	133.0610873629827
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	214.31479015303347
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr.	268.7192573304855
Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr.	218.17066065364466
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	230.05384268234076
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."
	138.29185703951552
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	143.63972612109225
I hate such false
friends.	317.5950546957509
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"
	118.59003393164703
_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,
	574.6262946646207
15th October._
	651.5212062469782
The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
	439.06690389352724
father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
	169.2762215751525
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
	193.6232255906184
breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
	253.56646662045978
lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
	128.03155960911457
terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
	91.74422834950147
variance.--"There, Mrs.	532.9036398671572
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on
	214.3643773210597
the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
	282.64434599224745
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
	131.93136411049346
Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
	953.8941105137934
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
	232.48772882536554
rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
	142.015817080366
demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
	182.4525262700765
ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
	273.9757273929319
instituted by the Church of England.	147.42967976333279
As a clergyman, moreover, I
	337.181122132095
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
	158.2917728842356
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
	199.66429804740235
I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
	210.25016641745754
commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
	68.12195798627974
entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
	257.4836124057371
and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	252.22830282733756
I cannot be
	69.84008966365847
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
	156.8333397919283
amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
	111.13334769657546
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
	135.82167753893833
of this hereafter.	170.586231334354
If you should have no objection to receive me
	109.87571755070452
into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
	241.1041643356142
se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
	257.73746400752685
Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
	208.2050318421717
Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
	141.82143627939826
duty of the day.	39.68246619023803
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
	266.13248652000885
your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
	155.3032032827341
WILLIAM COLLINS."
	227.5647962113789
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr.	448.22996319320606
Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	124.24002835483006
"He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."
	230.51561157407045
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."
	150.27455185603165
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."
	182.2522465549036
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	316.8826522015586
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.	190.64537505434663
"I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"
	222.76618530669398
I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	175.46746353898388
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	181.45568762032252
I am impatient to see him."
	112.9588613757048
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."
	236.42146318597466
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	276.9942604684557
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	149.65142160476125
As for
their mother, Mr.	162.72997513255365
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	121.45374843345927
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	115.14399832441727
Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.	155.7165974067366
Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	212.2937017893113
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	193.43756430676697
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	183.4951236022869
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs.	210.77513065149734
Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	148.3860217980499
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs.	131.83377493963147
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,
	306.85212344056845
"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	213.16005955572942
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	177.45570113642228
There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."
	189.10250251958874
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	188.23704096504392
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them.	247.05602886920113
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	151.4897597745126
They were not the only objects of Mr.	128.8408794341898
Collins's admiration.	112.91312129447742
The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	214.78769315057826
Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	165.44919681650993
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	184.24613887607566
But here he was set right by Mrs.	198.92902801924515
Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	138.64362359835613
He begged
pardon for having displeased her.	266.7252902233933
In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	170.32347008419674
CHAPTER XIV.	227.5647962113789
During dinner, Mr.	336.32729862366585
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	165.23503110238335
Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	254.47433127736178
Bennet could not have chosen
better.	126.1445552878771
Collins was eloquent in her praise.	129.80695729301945
The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine.	203.37028288384428
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	151.5864432396886
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	166.78567361802007
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	132.53937824832065
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.	226.44296329843257
Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	149.83191278266565
It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	121.50901485677407
Does she live near you, sir?"
	154.77082782819227
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."
	325.0055149151248
"I think you said she was a widow, sir?	111.4874402947614
has she any family?"
	74.02995655930357
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."
	196.43117033753347
"Ah!" cried Mrs.	269.7012237294353
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	217.22125506109282
And what sort of young lady is she?	98.32600343177326
"She is a most charming young lady indeed.	148.5308289759149
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	249.91436732097043
She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	224.67562380705013
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
	216.94747086756297
I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."
	173.53933063472738
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament.	360.68094756905856
Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	223.60437879643789
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."
	219.06176389642027
"You judge very properly," said Mr.	359.41873551309106
Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	129.87708938117805
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"
	280.5916057125343
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."
	291.78774507629225
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	285.0883353459167
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	200.13327768093365
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr.	201.44737235058463
Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	151.6907540365413
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,
	234.94675651041078
"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	325.90578458614726
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday.	195.00857359231145
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr.	151.09703912808376
Denny comes back from town."
	234.70282052288567
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.	226.37206191890817
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,
	249.94359918226152
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	289.49914492799195
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	265.9856643546069
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."
	296.3920381203415
Then turning to Mr.	211.35346518516883
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	231.13480252219307
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	260.5544617321665
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr.	229.64987583312436
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.	233.08553231899646
Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	169.53607150614823
CHAPTER XV.	227.5647962113789
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	189.27141510406597
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	218.02716474889317
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	163.36285780119783
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	273.5313318508054
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.	246.70489135056752
Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."
	196.64890127079352
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs.	181.87464881521004
Bennet was stirring the fire.	163.79875518534996
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	207.51929433828312
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	147.33056082018268
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.	199.48684439093896
Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr.	125.05236058444149
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.	150.41133077891865
Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.	204.37572972376273
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	172.64594314310628
Such
doings discomposed Mr.	1007.399963002718
Bennet exceedingly.	124.8034428832686
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr.	175.95405342975042
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	226.80915079780092
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	261.1954805359028
The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	153.1024888684244
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	227.1524245720636
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	145.49285687374035
The officer was the very
Mr.	154.7876008822121
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	290.1802337692298
All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	250.16291577056447
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr.	285.9073614344303
Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	126.07011421133137
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	157.74385218559038
His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	169.32548408715547
The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.	233.94067733757544
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object.	242.84017820040646
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	130.75405716670645
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	165.33343426704874
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	358.5724390820127
Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.	298.2672585443505
Darcy just deigned to return.	197.5433804763814
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	99.76783111394695
In another minute Mr.	466.81514313913243
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	178.58331609304412
Denny and Mr.	114.8481004092976
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	203.90966121673165
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	331.4588869632463
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr.	182.5632910055473
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr.	218.24931705677707
Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	149.14921652639072
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	172.10220195234467
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	119.44519207292386
She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.	130.66811618764672
Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.	219.1934989467863
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening.	137.70050343419098
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	301.12090871714327
The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	218.30510494239888
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	213.55821179016877
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	274.34006506642714
Bennet by admiring Mrs.	368.6912078964495
Philips's manners and politeness.	123.45180308934233
Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	127.6297370111102
CHAPTER XVI.	227.5647962113789
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr.	143.5910845929945
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr.	269.6896751275243
Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr.	200.28844873865688
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	108.86708257560146
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.	188.3384912085799
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs.	193.20979344387897
Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	202.8540485601185
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	221.32034934554298
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	178.58659560275925
It was over at last however.	108.2571258595918
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr.	236.26129616909878
The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr.	140.13892775346605
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	323.50242018412337
Wickham and the
officers, Mr.	113.21793907330357
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	234.8379331238442
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	189.89246493823677
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.	167.9675166281034
Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	138.7081073275367
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	196.44897423225183
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	264.4345495721836
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.	184.24718310171184
Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr.	133.97135083608183
She dared not
even mention that gentleman.	196.71462757243384
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	318.6226227150512
Wickham began the subject himself.	111.80823655808058
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr.	324.3309222841857
Darcy had been staying there.	114.7784939094808
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."
	261.4027107138389
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	203.81201304876177
You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."
	171.841456976304
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.	275.60971766047396
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."
	231.01252902345362
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	179.70030649581224
I am not qualified to form one.	148.23451898084636
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	131.74425178865107
It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	139.354285528762
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."
	201.31053151950715
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	260.13406367776054
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.	124.77776292487926
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	167.22922385150105
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.	224.16274668583816
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.	265.03011364973145
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."
	132.61852117746437
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield.	200.11414362523553
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."
	127.6286430484629
"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.	134.71787742713695
If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	235.2286189833077
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.	428.1724808798173
Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr.	182.01486256125963
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	234.1662960461474
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."
	233.3593428610328
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	153.12147327625303
Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	218.47389361591263
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	163.61682759364973
I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	211.09065654731285
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	155.12060030041843
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	161.3426501994776
I _must_ have employment and society.	250.00488360750404
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	211.9724770913096
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."
	183.60517341069743
"Yes--the late Mr.	180.94138976873555
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	152.2075500883616
I cannot do justice to his kindness.	137.1547881260689
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"
	356.53713861115887
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	136.59598033338668
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	211.8414573377131
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	171.91740602587103
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	308.0526075250032
I can recal nothing worse.	329.2365037449936
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."
	131.91727805612322
"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."
	391.2024046492455
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	122.53640447016289
Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
	433.0905207292849
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
	173.26181666193384
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	283.4628243742558
Had the late Mr.	180.94138976873555
Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	229.97471609450136
"I had not thought Mr.	140.95331193713028
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"
	226.84389872165664
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	270.82835134486993
His disposition must
be dreadful."
	182.2794515910597
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him."
	186.77178252163577
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!"
	237.2297710701496
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	232.5390377960275
Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr.	131.52256851104272
He was most highly esteemed by Mr.	256.0421779113186
Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	239.27552484940693
Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."
	149.12144628935783
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth.	429.37740503237427
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr.	221.65906119081868
Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it."
	179.88144702978866
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	263.14395391047486
It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	249.053570164529
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."
	187.87214378672584
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"
	158.1904567294412
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	218.9229252371103
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	228.83330770379735
He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."
	227.623920691975
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"
	218.60396035300315
He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	347.80640766458504
It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy.	182.5038795506119
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	184.3767179360942
But she is nothing to me now.	71.11949202521903
She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	344.2745740226076
Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."
	187.7372197472848
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,
	224.90539790582224
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.	216.4072480269121
Bingley! How can Mr.	418.93046533868954
Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	234.1694008651441
How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr.	291.67772568739605
"Not at all."
	50.93466213872721
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	274.55514778852887
He cannot know what Mr.	205.41222349569728
Darcy is."
	37.27146346332987
"Probably not;--but Mr.	119.55529183085406
He does not
want abilities.	213.17946172114458
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	203.73535993102286
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	134.14580172178972
His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."
	305.4914458920913
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr.	372.99875624617306
Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs.	300.02537397233306
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	185.7215658812408
It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs.	140.78748311912858
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	167.6732846444592
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	213.97048199614125
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.	211.90805246835063
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	218.12759842769802
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	286.4121896228541
I hardly know how Mr.	256.0303833520495
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
	126.22622387156096
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.	284.091007153657
"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections.	292.87261500108934
I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."
	160.1092527528749
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
	186.07848462995253
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley.	322.5713163685613
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	155.04398873993665
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
	206.1579036208617
She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."
	187.9184004703559
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.	184.13680895527963
Wickham's attentions.	109.17049998569267
There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs.	129.24155673594453
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	167.506821660931
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	137.79228404787415
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	122.09083001586569
She could
think of nothing but of Mr.	105.32856810952427
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.	129.40681487906915
Collins were once silent.	169.0595295102275
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr.	197.32452707139944
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr.	163.0145566360973
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	231.49158905837015
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.	217.77671932468562
Wickham and herself.	46.29238792114845
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr.	158.54682749274326
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.	156.03817462320387
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	176.52414333920228
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	189.23040388747205
Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	153.4643436104274
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."
	234.19450043098766
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."
	203.2431731851101
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	110.29603484211344
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr.	305.40564623253846
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	154.18070778262876
Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	176.70050157845213
"I can much more easily believe Mr.	255.92747233870836
Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr.	192.01603482679252
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr.	282.3012704733287
Darcy contradict it.	170.1468190912163
Besides, there was truth in his
looks."
	118.01840285795832
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think."
	174.77456037280163
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."
	217.33013893548141
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.	238.88342688208385
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	239.79212359188162
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr.	170.36998561584738
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.	186.50242962165385
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	194.22419152642817
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs.	187.24287806405812
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	103.35217050770413
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.	260.670247403921
Bennet's civilities.	148.94534126830249
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	157.80245948469872
Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr.	177.68112519362205
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.	149.16691436782594
Darcy's
looks and behaviour.	126.20517348773252
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.	318.46980581413936
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	129.0485238694458
And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	147.03031151087046
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	208.883384017956
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."
	265.13958646955814
Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr.	182.084410442553
Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	199.2742713007438
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."
	203.5808880552772
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	206.23862098736893
She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr.	250.2226585301165
There was no help
for it however.	91.22359328884703
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr.	192.45343621585917
Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	146.21224926718864
She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	202.89118043081638
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	183.26387903846927
Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	136.92031657731164
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	147.6933180358034
No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy.	301.2918928694128
Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.	250.5272336991409
Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	287.89943465861063
CHAPTER XVIII.	227.5647962113789
The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	177.40059493403882
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.	289.9795367711471
Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr.	147.61297027996517
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,
	183.03636775014087
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
	158.18819013818546
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham.	262.4405223905201
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr.	171.99789389428932
Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	374.2646733925216
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	156.91045888691727
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	224.5111873359634
Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	231.9373712997527
The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	149.26778005968686
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	159.417430135886
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.	207.87866922249066
He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	187.50563039288542
"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
such an evil."
	248.40040776200505
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	184.10423115948487
He replied, and was again silent.	107.7875344502084
"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.	226.93872316700995
Darcy.--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."
	174.922540401815
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	117.95241780323072
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."
	370.48394808307063
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"
	205.20158481542026
One must speak a little, you know.	99.30247217812067
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."
	156.87452756241245
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
	182.00909919017712
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he.	193.1884534074482
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
	291.2567846342541
"I must not decide on my own performance."
	181.10895213392644
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton.	140.66787043315105
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."
	207.23510674335938
The effect was immediate.	186.09736564244497
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	228.6836973061614
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."
	256.7583421540793
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."
	182.01152727501213
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	164.10513667352365
At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.	221.83582742794405
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	175.54169698047562
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	228.30337509992685
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	183.02880612137898
It is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	148.31924248658837
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	232.177488859492
What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr.	401.55015902299147
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
	274.5403092543703
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,
	140.3198644647895
"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."
	215.97151372404142
"I do not think we were speaking at all.	110.31138216029218
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
	214.70763087806603
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.	128.6954262743993
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."
	172.35492381919207
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."
	190.05983658659446
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.	190.66747116849743
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr.	238.50155997160923
Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	266.35958900621324
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."
	344.94416210801387
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.	140.69604759659734
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
	205.5695690203063
"I hope not."
	67.2527987792346
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"
	348.81738857689425
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	191.80185376739348
"I am trying to make it out."
	121.63794978257553
"And what is your success?"
	114.49848028794689
She shook her head.	160.88732969727354
"I do not get on at all.	89.80783229863853
I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
	219.74824031382997
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
	219.8675386496421
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."
	282.54644701600654
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	220.67516699186288
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	214.90740820169907
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,
	256.4883655579401
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr.	254.3135241865373
Darcy's steward.	141.44041510370988
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.	153.61386692867782
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr.	245.93591891694084
Darcy in a most infamous manner.	131.83099050354426
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr.	161.3874453557947
Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	138.20293046684085
His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	163.68691511146528
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
	267.3822334449116
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr.	208.2139324902257
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."
	191.23027863625228
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	420.18639762528477
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."
	337.45347651839495
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	218.42875572182527
I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.	173.720431236259
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	235.99826094735758
Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	204.7992549303212
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.	157.10954267732293
But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."
	153.65598201262506
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	236.56084256574266
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr.	146.50798456971282
Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr.	139.71238567727255
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	132.616740915649
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.	199.71495560191815
Darcy's
regard."
	95.51743905826767
Bingley does not know Mr.	179.1772104801386
Wickham himself?"
	72.87045506797527
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
	149.27474274176566
I am
perfectly satisfied.	175.79180892190692
But what does he say of the living?"
	92.43222404644546
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr.	209.7582213751479
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."
	142.47005086264966
"I have not a doubt of Mr.	107.02038303708211
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	247.79145504090397
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before."
	205.7610056581892
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	154.72784984582117
Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	191.0796770997581
On their being joined by Mr.	221.01530816413592
Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	141.93096900507518
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	151.47664471155588
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	226.53489573026172
My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
	300.944107508177
"Indeed I am.	200.9111478479034
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	221.06824069040164
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	241.17009417688294
It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."
	152.33751880064835
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr.	256.54870387004166
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.	163.21737452793582
Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.	163.78172698773696
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,
	165.1408681529079
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	238.8114049914045
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty.	203.8771083210003
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.	256.5685883310742
Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	232.5627637411816
Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	194.97667456372508
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	176.9540796401621
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	181.34208145074808
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	163.78689866341952
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	181.89657185122726
It was really a very
handsome thought.	115.48732836863678
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
	143.6560635218211
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.	165.94119088249556
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	207.79608689623672
She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	178.0594396969542
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	190.00426680658947
When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr.	195.54916308948108
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	282.2010331952566
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	141.33662524814187
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	161.23772706514373
It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	170.30238454914107
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	142.29781945790677
She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	267.42364984807887
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr.	201.57710358681402
Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	144.318556409545
"What is Mr.	159.61866480518856
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	125.10865251966567
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr.	290.12526535964025
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."
	194.69591352044318
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	111.86668755123348
Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	166.5691238477282
Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	227.46537455296007
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	135.4075783005985
The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	313.1312987610667
At length however Mrs.	325.8565042137876
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	202.1162160051993
Elizabeth now began to revive.	178.33259276509796
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	193.64591400772682
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley.	213.70436106755128
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	255.60954204775902
She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	250.84169276352117
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
	244.82034855506717
You have delighted us long enough.	183.9110855518451
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
	131.3548273027317
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	174.82225757937195
"If I," said Mr.	378.2632775783999
The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	179.17345823219597
He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	168.45338241131637
And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	230.71489630423648
I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family." And with a bow to Mr.	224.89193605147577
Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.	252.25420433478013
Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.	393.6041733119984
Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	206.9433346945558
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	149.52608733182117
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	168.885879903462
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	137.828032565639
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	137.08985810377845
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	129.20230386384355
There was no arguing upon such a project.	152.9018076706772
She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr.	340.97597584019854
Collins's conversation to herself.	82.9376114560892
She was at least free from the offence of Mr.	162.4319721143467
Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	227.7960555841715
She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.	129.48453088956623
Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	71.61134448263286
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs.	152.52457927776274
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	154.8873504421924
Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	174.11368096584354
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs.	350.7015174675844
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr.	189.19075080264733
Collins, who was complimenting Mr.	271.93856707499873
Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	146.53317749116454
Darcy said
nothing at all.	83.62846833979816
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	179.75153165928845
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	172.09042980054022
Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs.	286.8145634238452
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.	366.6559945026876
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	225.60801435206182
Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr.	188.79135583109687
Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	155.9622185429558
Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	174.80069263106108
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	240.66667428842376
Of having another daughter married to Mr.	242.6912500973315
Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	175.15098720801916
Bingley and Netherfield.	114.8481004092976
CHAPTER XIX.	227.5647962113789
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	296.3202197161653
Collins made his
declaration in form.	180.3984171183086
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	156.67450490491692
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,
	174.40687664302004
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.	189.32917129346635
Bennet instantly answered,
	217.69434627953356
"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,
	384.27694948805504
"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.	257.23538094687797
Collins must excuse
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	158.27446793356933
I am
going away myself."
	170.20866130821523
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr.	435.3333252399678
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	200.67837877979926
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr.	167.44015924865997
Collins began.	95.17911683595864
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	281.70912182185344
You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	197.4046408201128
You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	233.05207026333755
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	203.59862884503704
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."
	212.05431226009748
The idea of Mr.	171.34335011718304
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:
	196.92132753495844
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	217.1293432541255
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	213.65208842553457
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	259.9399880572332
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.	437.1061085364861
Collins, you
must marry.	94.42249165497697
This is my advice.	109.59389050775931
Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	189.34580950205176
Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.	240.23678534997975
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years.	214.22975633347474
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	218.27765856942955
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	142.67834780477577
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	230.5701680095871
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	147.44311868108565
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."
	281.21682980635666
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	161.2378091370798
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.	257.12400465526355
"You forget that I have made no
answer.	202.19547700613933
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	143.3342035018673
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."
	135.43528051695253
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr.	174.92774990910547
Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	178.9703209615678
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."
	171.2565277158306
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	300.8380596722871
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	172.06980923591505
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."
	232.57433581610005
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.	247.7378904130701
Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	178.83658988692267
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."
	190.14205813589436
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	134.5259822981231
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say.	180.9821497995684
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	162.1419247859355
This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr.	238.942769897975
Collins thus
addressed her,
	161.54516200047578
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."
	188.56302405896227
"Really, Mr.	227.5647962113789
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	307.3802695270867
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."
	171.13803869251308
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	187.35556717024306
My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	177.85285175678777
Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	246.24307744586903
As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."
	232.46282874985843
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	252.2073327127136
I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	175.79802604094533
I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	136.96150518962622
My feelings in every respect
forbid it.	166.88741425743584
Can I speak plainer?	584.2007800590684
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."
	197.22374058996556
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."
	265.62705668080827
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	248.72109536225577
CHAPTER XX.	227.5647962113789
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs.	167.14487045894646
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	216.97923206631543
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	198.91024960671442
Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	138.93183720808844
"But depend upon it, Mr.	251.81992973069063
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	120.18217098681836
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it."
	185.46828366958826
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr.	303.3123312827254
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.	241.05259170587624
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	173.04870542534826
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	158.68252024485093
I will go directly to Mr.	193.50337165109144
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
	145.3681088555833
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,
	146.44704702019925
"Oh! Mr.	227.5647962113789
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.	281.4917355092863
Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."
	114.43642139059652
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	161.23873903237592
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	103.16756533137544
"Of what are you talking?"
	101.20604738692147
"Of Mr.	227.5647962113789
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.	196.57793173647784
Collins,
and Mr.	114.8481004092976
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
	127.99270275334113
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	150.1865375080637
Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."
	119.49202567115209
"Let her be called down.	102.2723244848376
She shall hear my opinion."
	149.10804488973204
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	245.7756498499687
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	164.10674514077976
"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	130.74886431798524
I understand that Mr.	215.914736260483
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	125.76308150448432
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.	131.89633224809634
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"
	124.79168329401323
"I have, Sir."
	160.945226308744
"Very well.	59.6763808341638
We now come to the point.	86.09471456370342
Your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	282.3710056098226
Is not it so, Mrs.	109.20635329949506
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	297.3999790612014
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr.	180.42772866846832
Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."
	161.1825245508568
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs.	140.80985953521582
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	176.18146551078522
"What do you mean, Mr.	184.31610249491223
Bennet, by talking in this way?	109.03004412156446
You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."
	183.40589588390228
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	136.35293219135445
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."
	93.16517661907125
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs.	149.43260465857574
Bennet give up the point.	113.95395163546499
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	346.2129333007371
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	208.50702862876074
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	169.0662415475724
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them.	164.3669995910933
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.	223.0866214874641
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs.	182.52104431544694
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	173.1349729714061
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."
	324.66554361397135
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.	244.86429055019008
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	186.3301289082127
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	278.6744531952711
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so.	250.28043531686137
Those who do not complain are never
pitied."
	212.49183041307526
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	219.0523672226057
Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
	166.75628990604176
"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr.	213.4532611526918
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr.	238.96352435763535
Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	151.23484257789517
In a doleful voice Mrs.	400.393177402918
Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"Oh! Mr.	477.1395388613917
"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	198.6569827303997
Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned.	232.1871595531421
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	232.12809397386138
Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	179.9746150836629
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	288.6695908065885
But we are all liable to
error.	178.83197798399092
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	192.34188650518504
My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."
	219.91701297828175
The discussion of Mr.	254.80442179393
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	211.1569945299456
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	226.77341899977785
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	145.66214959781595
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	370.97506683528854
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	134.00134634105677
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	160.55168526916964
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	144.50365570493068
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.	246.35202427593234
Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	178.68654256592492
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	207.7622909967807
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr.	195.00665208533803
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
	153.0365101085987
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	191.98706188250375
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	210.10001360025979
When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,
	197.68594450191802
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	244.03260971729094
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	164.92401903404578
You shall hear what she says."
	150.3351506293216
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.	220.0425365480029
Hurst had a house.	63.09544136675309
The next was in these words.	129.78833949540973
"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	232.9900175890628
I depend on you for that." To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.	209.92646378010434
Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	112.72595308607865
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	132.2323972847922
But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.	239.74640658363737
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."
	146.08505623228334
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.	262.3162218667777
I will read it to you--
	69.13457678154857
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	184.97768636887295
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair.	196.47737981520524
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."
	228.86288097739637
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."
	208.19271724847516
"Why will you think so?	76.27273412892774
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	168.64141689498163
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr.	231.99768742102913
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	226.86560126582302
I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	209.0436295633881
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	227.51041936299183
With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"
	197.21302682374392
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she
finished it.	204.0547263565239
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard?	180.96296820419465
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
	98.03181671848722
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"
	224.76477334125065
"Most willingly."
	267.31513728086935
"You shall have it in few words.	115.64936475786912
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	190.572445697683
She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."
	128.6550986479867
Jane shook her head.	160.88732969727354
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	219.50513580694684
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	346.27241609226786
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.	148.43132280099005
But the case is
this.	72.97422112486197
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	212.225139134559
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
	195.29457692290865
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	302.9326368585207
But I know the
foundation is unjust.	223.34329274043242
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."
	175.51727967328708
"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	200.68720090132715
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	89.1394166941047
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
	157.45561053219677
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"
	207.34640879988766
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."
	210.03797987436866
"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."
	355.73814596820796
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."
	158.86111590581402
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	200.90264499828604
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	224.96935326724022
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	218.66170293839056
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	130.1997319930214
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	178.70586998650091
They agreed that Mrs.	251.15724041721293
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	173.0395567907974
After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr.	185.63231174675172
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	156.67331531928414
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.	183.220949978743
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	155.6563079277254
"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	182.86267423491034
This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr.	228.62884284071043
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	227.16286119247965
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	184.6044794287337
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	223.93324852704092
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	202.00486200040734
His
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	157.99505998506754
Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	211.37972617679299
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	148.58610080304047
Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	140.3377880070474
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	275.5748383666365
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	255.9293338781009
Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	212.59731901698382
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr.	296.46323355952006
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr.	238.1742780457447
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St.	170.6057373432605
The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid.	324.49185049996487
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	224.6608938687022
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	90.24951249183653
Her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	219.4658601551907
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	149.22346493987504
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	234.0890914916737
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	173.60961326385782
The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	208.8112380903701
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	145.94993971769378
She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr.	181.3131975006103
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	130.8496530092907
A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	227.2425160307885
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs.	142.61638623717784
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	181.07847310453147
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."
	195.40880293450542
They were all astonished; and Mr.	163.39380001071845
Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,
	165.74805077559378
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."
	302.993300653564
"My dear sir," replied Mr.	279.69968199103835
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."
	222.42598325882585
Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."
	210.99056112664368
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	193.3135108228936
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth."
	234.1933836064623
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	222.53755171376775
Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	138.6496315748782
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	179.7880143540161
But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	129.78090247801626
The possibility of Mr.	213.0329716901184
Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,
	180.49541294853975
"Engaged to Mr.	111.0122223449196
Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"
	216.0499164932873
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,
	266.1344862988499
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr.	226.6028565417187
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	167.55837987878527
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr.	214.97812377557665
Collins was wishing to
marry you.	95.11425401387547
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done.	139.0204189168924
I am not romantic you know.	131.58763823531567
I
never was.	55.50785613506079
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.	270.4443186015431
Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."
	199.03950814452614
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	174.10470760078135
Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	152.83942233271767
It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	135.84800228748347
The strangeness of Mr.	336.8092903569417
Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	199.66014606869916
Charlotte the wife of Mr.	115.85128354351167
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	167.888919246989
CHAPTER XXIII.	227.5647962113789
With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs.	222.1020568143203
Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,
	362.3952331460459
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
that Mr.	291.832865141219
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"
	252.5600688242711
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	207.62072731305824
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	233.02301400064388
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.	153.51681884063336
Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	177.88101458911942
Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	180.33966931792366
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	252.49650093433667
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	281.00787518610457
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!
	169.09572022516218
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	167.41426536145414
Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.	150.62265483307957
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs.	232.77649519526028
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs.	183.36770601692135
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	270.38550909617413
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	188.68419381187343
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	186.82014690285695
The promised
letter of thanks from Mr.	248.27961576795266
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	184.07600462391582
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	213.32407048957288
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs.	177.95814642847677
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	193.1473973466157
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	227.03352676006605
Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.	143.39023235271384
Bingley's continued
absence.	165.8507455622165
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	317.7986016948682
Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	242.489195258465
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	189.83350007327513
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	205.93041385448848
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	218.49355794879784
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	207.29567945923176
It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	473.0874833773557
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	153.25422831609274
The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	176.81757667152968
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	147.65829949171402
The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	167.95566880673917
The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her.	209.42665424884908
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	201.21340052250355
Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.	167.31517336314315
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.	132.97396269430143
Bennet were dead.	165.54309799648695
She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	156.70708468643343
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"
	151.28343182342303
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	174.84184318526007
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."
	274.17896198447403
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,
	133.37143905305066
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	124.17193715068582
If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it."
	109.73772033974707
"What should not you mind?"
	87.73234368447265
"I should not mind any thing at all."
	105.0671108969026
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."
	164.6931066458753
"I never can be thankful, Mr.	234.33131960430288
Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	113.63727992856626
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.	181.11313250849952
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"
	262.80495134649937
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr.	158.34071399519664

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	227.5647962113789
CHAPTER I.	227.5647962113789
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	213.8418605280093
The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.	166.01958264948215
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	182.6830428265982
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	247.1017095871691
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr.	193.60021000907147
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	185.9316805686292
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	176.9909544390423
Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	168.07158129978413
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit.	261.7128077279523
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	168.90123502782356
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	134.4299448959187
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	183.75496343526484
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,
	232.76234340909923
"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	154.83694071014733
But I
will not repine.	243.63592628788652
It cannot last long.	153.44464342469183
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."
	111.25018227087483
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	165.71914437914282
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	325.4116888926903
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	121.70279365475801
I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	125.39181759202444
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	320.05996331282523
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."
	163.1810852341183
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.	314.6647293198249
Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you.	190.06985081589957
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."
	198.04619165011792
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	327.82602537974327
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.	162.06860435924372
_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	173.94423752294023
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	173.64781193020985
There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	301.6743530263888
The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	179.06109282710105
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage.	235.66731818115107
It is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!"
	184.01683071435485
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	160.39069338115212
They will
ruin your happiness.	196.95732776199085
Consider Mr.	227.5647962113789
Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."
	141.10671641775045
My dear Jane, Mr.	444.70696115298495
Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	199.00076976999816
You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas.	208.93434165861746
You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."
	223.16589892873444
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	199.12429572695248
But enough of this.	65.31656706067132
You alluded to something else.	198.21549008629958
You
mentioned _two_ instances.	557.4948492726328
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	264.9861619870303
We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	251.427150563381
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	162.5650270141679
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	202.2657973226214
Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."
	209.56610682516907
"And men take care that they should."
	160.95014174008602
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."
	184.09696615336435
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr.	240.74098627807993
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."
	133.00699723466474
"And do you impute it to either of those?"
	116.10790820950761
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem.	312.2029908983824
Stop me whilst you can."
	145.36856384656008
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."
	240.54909558789188
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
	125.30634363537115
"I cannot believe it.	102.73281555032989
Why should they try to influence him?	142.9591244827917
They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."
	139.67593334744532
"Your first position is false.	300.18551404139794
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."
	190.22465014212273
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	240.95748100604186
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	148.49871673619592
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	140.75007616625487
Do not distress me by the idea.	105.45300117098483
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	152.54698877032953
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."
	114.94625416934758
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.	146.37788976139316
Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	192.69822341464715
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	198.0807738880113
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	153.4388634619978
Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr.	178.4231254391598
Bingley must be down again in the summer.	101.81108344129805
Bennet treated the matter differently.	247.71916834664196
"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find.	231.45349809569615
I congratulate her.	117.61778178220482
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	127.35161443517792
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	134.77096316871112
When is your turn to come?	102.18959831498466
You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane.	230.48516876744534
Now is your time.	76.94637871154816
Let Wickham
be _your_ man.	247.62213696468456
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."
	215.6466000872552
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	190.73468081115297
We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune."
	193.27383138317518
"True," said Mr.	191.3434532098033
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family.	237.67636528273675
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	149.9185337080612
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr.	239.02102508813655
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr.	176.07671454499916
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	96.95913707092338
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr.	266.60176516257343
CHAPTER II.	227.5647962113789
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.	210.7687697438502
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday.	176.28402622035532
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	163.1871679025568
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	215.31938208289534
On the following Monday, Mrs.	293.4745889327792
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn.	143.01091323086848
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	178.66088908925266
The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	195.09418356260346
Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs.	274.3111001795354
Bennet and Mrs.	114.8481004092976
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	220.81072848245375
Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	188.96942937589526
The first part of Mrs.	180.5075088388621
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	204.74424866073304
When this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	134.6000532764831
It became her turn to listen.	166.30310083794643
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	130.56873630095546
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	139.19147212246796
Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	79.71281936013821
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.	266.826264308984
Bingley, if she could.	58.161995875024935
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr.	170.47091352685555
Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	110.66691292785035
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	197.50270793799675
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	324.8331185312401
They are all for what they can get.	109.34877110382241
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	75.7456592496755
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	186.88251199454547
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."
	171.77604955463755
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	137.37584961187994
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	174.12873336874628
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.	175.39364961557274
"I am
sorry it went off.	162.0327135075328
But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr.	319.6492148595143
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."
	239.4630436319904
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	199.35632668527145
We do not suffer by _accident_.	197.8571380591112
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."
	154.72083787377872
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr.	705.2945784435352
Bingley's
love?"
	84.99353356228725
"I never saw a more promising inclination.	209.84999825279132
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	204.95183690047233
Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	149.76893349748255
At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	213.14738536756136
Could there be
finer symptoms?	253.51074261349456
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
	173.42565020956988
Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	190.42875858217778
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	181.0643569507966
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	112.75918352089656
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	185.4522822024599
"I hope," added Mrs.	290.3699908539322
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	136.26283645494374
We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."
	155.44379933489526
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr.	133.62654754967687
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	161.18058555273026
Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.	220.4872947419413
Bingley
never stirs without him."
	203.9000940789549
I hope they will not meet at all.	108.97032112516295
_She_ will not be able to help calling."
	122.51160242995797
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	183.86508752421628
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.	206.8003655295143
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	172.74282707838393
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	141.54495338374673
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr.	130.9237166391513
Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs.	133.5230405084469
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	150.51850236684874
To Mrs.	227.5647962113789
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	285.2789080118647
About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	179.10096978750616
They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	160.42792936426403
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.	217.0369615213797
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	243.34436260410234
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	222.9851867383546
On being made acquainted with the
present Mr.	192.2275485374065
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr.	198.15923029780467
Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	316.4299959933953
CHAPTER III.	227.5647962113789
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
	208.72914099375222
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly.	240.52017791510227
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	144.0219002543753
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	131.67169732761852
But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	119.79905565099338
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	106.63727498015555
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure.	262.9305001345866
You must not disappoint your father."
	157.5642363358411
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
	155.13920067229878
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	157.3292537317264
Wickham too.	70.37357696862398
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."
	138.81936411367485
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
	102.27133768504436
I will try again.	164.64198554721602
At present I am not in love with
Mr.	199.64476243192829
Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	168.36600248312405
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	197.32091568931526
My
father, however, is partial to Mr.	198.87299612975002
In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	227.54366861507046
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	120.9542165051403
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	188.9385929475148
In short,
I will do my best."
	230.61607810829594
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	133.28028142318365
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."
	216.1006896753661
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	207.07236479563107
But do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	121.11896700627317
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	136.8628820451376
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	192.2051539642001
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	203.0204549190784
His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	207.43235085771562
"And I have another favour to ask.	225.23886997453596
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
	331.4945920553635
Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."
	129.2806318356871
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	158.1298164235781
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
I hope you will consent to be of the party.	150.54705108619902
Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."
	112.93658042582393
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	172.04937589559702
Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	124.49117238931025
Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	190.14785583425223
She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	264.961826633271
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	240.58892794674225
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	209.91952930004803
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	221.71133907460109
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline.	190.64148468534208
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."
	175.22377796432113
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	186.83897984419005
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.	145.61786052514796
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	151.99336047571606
I enquired after their brother, of course.	170.79437480575845
He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr.	138.72648911522376
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	122.6122970810015
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	225.2161161890078
I wish I could see her.	167.253192700742
Hurst were going out.	128.19074707265904
I dare say I shall
soon see them here."
	262.07697277178596
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	189.00273112320275
Bingley her sister's being in town.	84.79395153903522
She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	187.30204266769582
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer.	185.22432197740147
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	130.54831931381122
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
	294.57209911139364
her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
	243.76235305464468
been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	279.547040285781
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
	150.43914925171683
obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
	255.91883243968977
was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	162.34609541803974
I do not at
	57.607201664038904
if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
	228.7392455527008
be deceived again.	164.1541702632442
and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	166.0365254320945
she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
	91.25283162978542
she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
	217.80229955067054
altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
	165.15580525207136
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	117.43346644708288
I pity, though I
	374.09041181953063
cannot help blaming her.	181.8515362874592
She was very wrong in singling me out as
	150.31540782472274
she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
	275.20086640074584
her side.	92.85224579715671
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
	165.1144970047517
acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
	173.81708830543872
brother is the cause of it.	58.39379067614931
I need not explain myself farther; and
	205.74700247167436
feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
	92.40049118137105
deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
	107.95795056518266
feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	151.49826274748713
I cannot but wonder,
	129.51898471360332
however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
	126.75206795188274
all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	232.36504107352522
He knows of my
	94.4554852664486
being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
	147.49301956530314
yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
	108.95124864847175
persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	196.32170734516953
I cannot
	75.3030952197717
understand it.	30.338660011316918
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
	344.7650752718894
be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
	134.21827955861286
duplicity in all this.	53.87419770023652
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
	306.76268090645095
thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
	116.78606664898042
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	132.09808564693597
Let me hear
	99.68189544119775
from you very soon.	69.76892444737105
Miss Bingley said something of his never
	137.31791695858485
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
	114.23573403310331
with any certainty.	156.52760485331285
We had better not mention it.	95.85503565426347
I am extremely
	153.40045934328893
glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
	167.22023659395424
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	212.07460919442755
I am
	52.67907019732738
sure you will be very comfortable there.	103.65614027604133
"Your's, &c."
	118.48549454437234
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	206.67611687463224
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	160.63468195093745
She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	133.1252026298809
His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.	193.41043952312336
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	195.71098927542806
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	210.28184654082824
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	126.01844573319356
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	190.5746888526728
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	225.5228143943821
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	166.26361898301525
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	137.17264890828167
Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	241.94404822488133
But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	358.1365410119583
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	157.8631513943803
There can be no love in all this.	89.99507880273458
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	305.7210025934262
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	309.32723902420673
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do.	224.62778371247288
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."
	138.1247462623357
CHAPTER IV.	227.5647962113789
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	330.3694933990373
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.	148.82446665662007
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	197.33162812741074
Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.	234.61932728915517
The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	180.7062311371073
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	288.1773489472931
She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	211.03595480721236
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	119.32100024308905
The farewell between herself and Mr.	288.8200882170546
His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	168.77627389068564
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	187.84871224391878
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William's too long.	306.41495711357857
He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	183.31372263432704
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.	171.41906445060926
Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	204.76952211065895
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	183.8455079137747
All was joy and
kindness.	121.0591132552135
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	169.19042190733597
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	159.26221305029821
Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	190.3019993483123
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	131.9992903758363
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	247.66436095238453
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."
	173.52396780242853
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	202.9129386446441
Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	405.11061745793273
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."
	167.56383176480796
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."
	203.3434288750649
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	158.79406063461573
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."
	177.03388029293842
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"
	186.09053414806704
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."
	232.9293173164188
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	256.5299442739332
If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"
	186.35154560933245
It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."
	245.6624317267636
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	164.05582526261085
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	312.9764777551156
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."
	144.552116510306
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better.	196.13012777107164
I am sick of them all.	108.97156392743034
Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	284.34875921324476
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."
	228.92078400318312
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."
	434.98824053982224
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	143.83647754813435
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."
	98.06220592330259
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	151.7997835815626
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour.	338.5297881895109
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	141.5963978714944
What are men
to rocks and mountains?	206.54672352528078
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	248.71410210924378
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	258.55600441077445
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	378.2974969099195
Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."
	311.34776465251116
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	152.37216591425735
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	312.24991728997963
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	119.09410870490252
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	247.28103503095966
The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	249.3219556234171
Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	178.4439969636555
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	122.86704278398847
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	181.7714494874098
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	154.27874653757
They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	188.27234729660705
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	173.06241665469776
When Mr.	227.5647962113789
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte.	208.04598500543756
After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr.	163.64715652359894
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	146.3507635684764
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	179.61958370632618
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	280.8357499876384
He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	219.0928617634962
But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	182.43023246307547
It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	360.9604771797966
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	235.9696031451898
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	224.19630519136294
When Mr.	227.5647962113789
Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	211.83558966255384
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	193.65188142371284
It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.	168.93035855911577
Collins joining
in, observed,
	208.23414187934029
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.	256.11390642922044
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	182.96971683566616
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	201.76248658471843
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.	172.7186878347391
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	252.84851549753284
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."
	171.1082135064695
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."
	286.0563119092887
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	187.3149456647153
She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."
	167.70232097299393
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	204.2194866507399
She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr.	278.43145353024516
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings.	149.98370266918081
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	232.4106586917142
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	194.3034688064871
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,
	262.5347326272427
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	157.02750000120557
Make
haste, and come down this moment."
	181.7623816487352
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	221.10459371162258
"I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!"
	179.71481461541194
"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine.	233.6991307861575
The old lady is Mrs.	261.06505872319195
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	141.5990819138331
The
other is Miss De Bourgh.	437.25174082777033
Only look at her.	74.90448428211674
She is quite a little
creature.	129.85837584836662
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"
	117.84434855815135
"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	298.4273650878707
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."
	290.927192407603
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	268.02939115896254
"She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.	207.13791129832256
She will
make him a very proper wife."
	136.39210121156924
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way.	292.395991858611
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	113.55742017072137
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.	194.43432700743264
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	161.4011690637271
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	166.45170328062522
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings.	208.4349401879054
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	162.31100777315183
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	142.89247250615978
Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!"
	220.03574528504464
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	180.8109679020786
About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."
	266.90171565179185
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings.	141.84126512606892
Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	188.18512360145644
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,
	152.88036530868447
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	242.52007563228594
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	232.8545157336643
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	148.62609205247838
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	189.22522620368258
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."
	184.93228172023913
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St.	235.07715368749982
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr.	197.15172379509605
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	244.02438671012905
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	289.165630490241
She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	287.255765682652
From the entrance hall, of which Mr.	175.53114740090504
Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs.	320.0460520969638
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	288.6649387752099
Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	136.20573371343235
In spite of having been at St.	171.0479202944531
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	206.58227428754938
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	184.51288690136437
She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.	222.40128786627048
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr.	232.22069664270444
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	150.91368954473631
There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	226.93787857921382
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.	263.01980721985734
Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	168.48037589548434
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr.	154.4631334475878
Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	252.2545551512387
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr.	168.85388976588916
Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	246.43222834895582
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	329.1537107703105
The party did not supply much conversation.	196.43141826824777
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	185.73517847048265
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	175.5066488275445
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	158.6031239829532
Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	196.11143226585472
In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs.	164.41744851365604
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	161.27990810616524
Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	159.5511821283598
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
observed,
	213.90544293888
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr.	254.01058135704804
For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"
	391.32196533808934
"A little."
	63.80140367029256
"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	125.15708783172472
Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"
	310.2608628777699
"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.	179.84046824414048
"No, not at all."
	51.644499347219934
"What, none of you?"
	75.1044471196035
"Not one."
	54.262790046553604
"That is very strange.	119.23467394779658
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	189.6164048827459
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."
	199.43242284417798
"Has your governess left you?"
	160.056924725565
"We never had any governess."
	137.67850764426746
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	199.44962526855983
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	120.63992712597395
who attended to you?	68.60596502219421
Without a governess you must
have been neglected."
	143.83206340361642
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	182.14234391443597
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	136.22840748179016
Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."
	167.41066343573416
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	208.04703310426004
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	176.6803892720962
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	194.8854559425593
Four nieces
of Mrs.	225.9799182371028
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	186.60758907190117
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	290.76054631895096
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	744.8262542308343
"Yes, Ma'am, all."
	167.50360562320725
"All!--What, all five out at once?	234.06502521895771
Very odd!--And you only the
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"
	321.8872488436334
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	154.40243971043787
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	136.38510504530626
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	191.7868767665347
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."
	209.9398664382346
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"
	200.55883562981163
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
	337.8777740791305
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	252.04467355806574
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."
	243.91079183682996
"I am not one and twenty."
	91.72718892714724
Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	278.27281867640437
Jenkinson to make up her
party.	89.0025370107241
Their table was superlatively stupid.	348.3328643385132
Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	193.26111393047543
Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	327.1569450438753
A great deal more passed at the
other table.	149.58755818354737
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	271.59573882953015
Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	218.732496138582
Sir William did not say much.	162.08637815152701
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	226.52222113787573
Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	333.13180183454955
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	244.98446864635014
From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.	204.87354311678195
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	264.7317669586583
As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	147.7640841768618
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr.	272.3368031454828
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	151.02179604623862
CHAPTER VII.	227.5647962113789
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	174.0936267604142
While Sir William was with them, Mr.	289.7141929917124
Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	165.58542390155773
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	139.0687184695003
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr.	190.7178331033876
Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	192.74152476537998
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr.	160.41992451703422
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	243.16576239933937
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	193.4165492153611
Very few days passed in which Mr.	225.4639819450087
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	151.5295941987252
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	171.27215111050063
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs.	205.4986468711975
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr.	158.04108336445134
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	294.0574938950235
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	170.17603998189244
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	246.61837506708775
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	170.02822180189372
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	156.9111664277712
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr.	162.18690390663397
Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.	188.37814678037023
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr.	195.1725813717973
Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	211.2709106214871
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects.	194.46138742352304
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr.	308.52453001145176
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr.	156.99022725032344
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	166.17273549522176
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,
	188.49437912787064
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	205.23730030003887
Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."
	135.86658546937068
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	191.1108582639933
Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	205.88185848604357
Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs.	196.55871884901168
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	141.23694393003706
Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	191.5317596954919
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs.	219.9587939029316
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	151.24280192254463
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family.	160.56914107942987
She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,
	136.7994226288983
Have you never
happened to see her there?"
	92.52686772350674
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	162.66540119960416
CHAPTER VIII.	227.5647962113789
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings.	164.54229945607858
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.	195.68976910750914
Darcy they had
only seen at church.	139.90122080521877
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.	201.5668305880655
Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	169.7281268659118
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	202.80484830365407
Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	223.77400870648154
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,
	160.9009398112178
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	137.7262839706949
What is it you are talking
of?	70.9864883354614
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	361.9018962386843
Let me hear what it is."
	85.96661623534862
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	191.39457368317468
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	602.4652607286282
It is of all subjects my delight.	124.0392312809211
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	123.67750056161059
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	289.6098689565211
And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	165.1620063710254
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"
	379.5348490958854
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	191.45297709029188
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."
	165.82434151683654
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	183.7694267366814
She practises very constantly."
	415.04638890240483
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	171.1847871363431
I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	250.3524694432034
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs.	291.60205538784066
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs.	192.96908006355437
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."
	91.32754769276875
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	157.37213974300974
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	231.88375428879252
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	216.78407499380916
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,
	150.33935748781357
"You mean to frighten me, Mr.	277.7490203425085
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	113.8025208735823
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	239.56795466899734
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	129.76677320069405
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."
	164.1826500363997
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	205.4089608433635
I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	192.02368577645564
Indeed, Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."
	165.26794966122495
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	113.7044119131101
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.	190.47846753546165
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
	220.24156856990308
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	239.8077125636437
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	120.63457632754574
He danced
only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	193.68651653228738
He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	213.70921016695672
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
	150.36653245663226
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."
	119.66016585076252
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	148.70794068464696
Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	498.67757423397705
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."
	378.66436981306015
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"
	163.472285485534
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	234.48699060261706
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."
	113.90610584342498
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	263.90009201765633
I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."
	297.0116472232053
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	290.3241658096738
They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	154.41249408903718
But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising.	204.41730518222357
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."
	208.45955942530017
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.	242.17069558078424
You have employed your
time much better.	166.1502927072511
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	169.8125525983341
We neither of us perform to strangers."
	193.25559935263024
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	186.72020577435276
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	289.2402911959038
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,
	220.8680176685538
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master.	184.84117527354155
She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	173.22776606825937
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	197.3940285334176
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	371.0082199981761
Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	142.47202929997914
CHAPTER IX.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs.	190.3646421675491
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr.	199.1390247272929
Darcy, and Mr.	114.8481004092976
Darcy only, entered the room.	103.79571740647415
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	166.9557007627184
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	261.9429050123113
It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,
	179.3445535538731
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.	420.01875381687466
Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before.	144.20767239472502
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."
	188.92331751179412
"Perfectly so--I thank you."
	202.0021566807178
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,
	126.58760832726931
"I think I have understood that Mr.	292.8044819553745
Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"
	170.51158775262647
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	126.20379445299812
He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."
	159.96442056312884
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	145.55281044845114
But perhaps Mr.	280.314575586302
Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."
	119.02732803378318
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."
	173.83372173977017
Elizabeth made no answer.	118.54727678557937
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	118.85988842493745
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house.	206.26071979098032
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.	228.9387509125508
Collins first came to Hunsford."
	168.24200550118505
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."
	155.67635343562435
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."
	164.89303929348097
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	158.3754168801846
My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.	317.82777683887997
Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	114.25251744548876
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."
	160.3389578370725
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."
	112.13606064432227
"An easy distance do you call it?	178.75048595019652
Little more than half a day's
journey.	141.3405463905665
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth.	152.23778508226738
"I should never have said Mrs.	165.6237580357558
Collins
was settled _near_ her family."
	151.0793817484069
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	141.91712282193663
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
	272.3254962942308
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,
	164.36012372342105
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	120.13641257309095
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	200.71772329348025
But that is not the
case _here_.	105.24835203811838
Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."
	224.90090201711
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	201.3728610636206
_You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."
	163.03161683165342
Elizabeth looked surprised.	176.5407546146963
The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,
	250.44055710868406
"Are you pleased with Kent?"
	166.55032134848702
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	185.78624449050469
The tête-à-tête surprised
them.	437.18828444162193
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	253.27989452884665
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	109.25452011290268
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."
	144.1648792760384
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	158.397054017807
All field sports were over.	419.35006395593615
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	192.7191439958719
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	220.1250121333717
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	199.592649325162
But why Mr.	304.2633478002323
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	130.0703509863354
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	171.45978887290573
He seldom appeared really
animated.	479.4235611874422
Collins knew not what to make of him.	70.72836915136936
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	172.75373398598757
He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	137.66872506193502
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	191.08358108556547
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	140.2272154682323
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.	379.08396474724094
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.	227.523177700652
Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	142.78397114704603
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr.	388.64245979987174
It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	220.02836545011738
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.	183.63585487960347
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	162.50746271686572
His words
seemed to imply it.	179.53993998098395
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	187.18794232524888
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	184.11907990242693
It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage.	140.4785324352253
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.	247.53571173048056
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	199.77578577077117
Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,
	136.99308966555233
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
	122.44889154248646
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	180.03968184487124
Are
you going much farther?"
	142.0673728218546
"No, I should have turned in a moment."
	150.99858455639986
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.	207.36245423690434
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.	205.43227018432822
But I am at his disposal.	212.62713941270476
He
arranges the business just as he pleases."
	223.06883708283527
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	131.63114540887835
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	222.8358641245871
"But so we all do.	85.97530588936934
I speak
feelingly.	341.5892612973458
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."
	235.34473039606442
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either.	160.07337649519152
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	196.6870490380247
When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"
	177.05703932559427
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	285.67374377692624
But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	237.58214622895508
Younger sons cannot marry
where they like."
	307.13512808623005
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."
	202.01161607846512
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."
	204.45088516067045
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	230.31634009985308
Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
	301.6056648853934
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	125.10087526278512
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,
	175.2458316652813
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	191.4006666381991
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	185.17163811821106
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."
	124.61103164874184
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	199.155292302864
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."
	182.23578440766772
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?	183.21718382125684
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."
	159.49680542624077
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	192.82403119522647
She directly replied,
	179.87843694112883
"You need not be frightened.	156.73182752379503
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	151.0999996952018
She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	152.08491309551397
Hurst and
Miss Bingley.	257.9448360869519
I think I have heard you say that you know them."
	134.53151872361957
"I know them a little.	81.382559602565
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."
	155.1004577041627
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr.	600.3671511286752
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.	207.21395633693066
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."
	149.2405268290555
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him.	207.59799027341157
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant.	215.47805441294392
It was all conjecture."
	109.65122413212619
"What is it you mean?"
	74.40380425863316
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."
	139.75430480814592
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
	164.43025268625934
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley.	168.63281297735617
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."
	182.0274217119985
"Did Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"
	157.3112445070831
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."
	183.13075917536702
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	176.02319367541034
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	190.93522610717864
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	188.3706344497086
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	113.49319044628739
"Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	214.71731585989244
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
	258.82055062876555
"I do not see what right Mr.	185.50063486250144
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	154.23151538796822
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."
	83.1403704564602
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
	222.54424151684452
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr.	163.00455822717296
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	210.60433689766867
There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	141.285117345078
It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	122.42823967542091
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr.	251.09551692721004
Darcy could have
such boundless influence.	213.53979890915627
That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr.	174.09259012643923
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	187.17656647448473
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	199.8805756771248
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	268.1662925260076
Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr.	248.62216753859184
Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.	226.30619610046298
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr.	189.73745255067766
Bingley for his sister.	59.93469309865342
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr.	198.3664790753165
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	179.66137037205687
Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr.	154.96545187197
Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	245.01670483454723
CHAPTER XI.	227.5647962113789
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr.	230.94434153483274
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	362.91481447975457
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	174.5393868832261
Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	206.49570154177826
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	190.19756466664455
It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	131.17724746571326
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	188.43606463349693
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.	209.03865890734326
Darcy walk into the
room.	104.98341346281006
She answered him with cold civility.	188.50782769854965
He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	177.91727623177437
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	90.97764402898997
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,
	177.03177833162917
"In vain have I struggled.	474.61734303549383
My feelings will not be
repressed.	142.4010042034699
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."
	198.32524278554186
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	176.95015586204744
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	293.960443112953
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	139.2692118163677
His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	190.03033442434833
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	174.18994383405595
She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	163.89678172319682
He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	146.6337523076303
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	114.55270221494716
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	310.939097115262
Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,
	189.66052534750557
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	228.28185664686157
It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	265.09277250643714
But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	264.54437610527356
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	139.96053965086932
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration.	228.6034431249964
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."
	196.34494976208882
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	227.72865170213308
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	241.02669030935232
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	158.1170012281408
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,
	159.57264159679292
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected.	224.67607395774522
But it is of small importance."
	102.03071886400716
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	189.32887829360786
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	384.17931997125163
But I have
other provocations.	313.5867486214433
You know I have.	168.9415785662843
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"
	163.901293024518
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	202.3267460427694
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	337.3598614985841
You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."
	167.43337574843252
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	235.2011667281587
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	154.5809902877759
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.	112.57029041283234
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	243.36605292292188
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."
	332.49524604973277
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	238.28487328752985
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	158.696895916744
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	122.44770152667157
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr.	304.01635672109893
On this subject, what can you have to
say?	89.09299277009767
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	308.94288944424324
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"
	333.0657584749851
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	245.62882134700322
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"
	174.36824349255204
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."
	427.569082469175
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.	269.20112819941687
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	267.47531177394785
You have done all this! and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."
	152.66721941608907
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully.	225.9601812273738
My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	291.1819270572491
These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	345.84126235852085
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	273.73859905744064
They were natural and just.	117.96723564972429
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	131.7021580835999
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"
	233.50031603115912
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,
	181.86559227526394
"You are mistaken, Mr.	279.9468439958245
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."
	167.96634674526464
"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."
	122.64478232303026
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	177.44246675909696
She went on.	90.12489992469663
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
	197.4589496804253
"You have said quite enough, madam.	168.1386811496135
I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	120.00908799087742
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."
	156.79490734364293
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	191.9292240050072
She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	193.79974482879078
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr.	182.2378443569919
Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for
so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	145.63348799054197
But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.	202.51540976438775
Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	180.27178156820167
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	229.9154432291751
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	180.6661105249999
She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	172.22294223969956
She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.	182.40592615200973
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	204.53458725261225
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	177.00953494572053
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	162.7131071759868
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	159.8374862124529
She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.	172.99068746476635
Darcy, she was directly retreating.	163.7322777070319
But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	200.27509638660254
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr.	159.67825244860273
Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	179.55768429691676
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	171.726318280561
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	167.07866085941978
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	308.7082509794202
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
	207.53066954802057
"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
	179.43410762892805
or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
	221.3753953776832
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
	251.14124541211774
myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
	126.07460678877395
and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
	125.80726059761732
spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	109.53638916371149
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
	275.4405366006848
attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
	313.1968305478788
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
	141.0345945982623
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	173.4446885086055
The first mentioned
	158.89742242925806
was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
	200.51907228757145
defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
	214.55116039400815
ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.	243.64586854720125
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
	185.79342478276345
my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
	150.43479884270812
had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
	205.36366430672064
had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
	189.8229832949898
to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
	181.0262254323953
be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
	223.00772942129353
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
	173.2056675343662
bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
	220.39781894491495
future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
	150.92893268920125
motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is
	132.40285339341278
due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
	194.56913082867314
may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
	253.55162751032373
had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
	191.21520832029043
others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
	205.6382745238207
young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
	87.01241703100348
dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
	161.48696118090143
serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
	220.3106215196393
Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
	134.64319868638762
expectation of their marriage.	69.58029035635641
He spoke of it as a certain event,
	107.84753440824932
of which the time alone could be undecided.	142.01838300316737
From that moment I
	181.95141381240816
observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
	204.98779323075925
perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
	233.39942277602813
ever witnessed in him.	112.9209287840177
manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
	181.9978579418058
symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
	194.70558510555358
evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
	143.14288478298351
pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
	136.42214445073674
sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
	251.51723835907373
been in an error.	117.5510300868883
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
	161.554420404373
the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
	235.86349204844026
error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
	143.28105642952994
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
	213.8357410654017
of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
	122.67759912792036
the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
	239.61732868574668
temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
	189.395748245745
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
	162.64584043092967
influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
	146.15689083570504
indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
	342.82586980107965
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
	242.52406024110013
the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
	277.21624167879764
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
	201.57168655206053
own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
	122.49038086021761
my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
	142.37530352370007
repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
	238.20240658604746
an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
	294.3240664462074
forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
	228.35721245239418
must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's
	248.12508850749515
family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
	121.27683961736567
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
	325.79036033040666
by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
	182.48371933552386
your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	305.9422730943704
But amidst
	241.94858457234758
your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
	150.45356321285885
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
	117.29759884125383
consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
	114.81670857577453
avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
	205.14942614585183
bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
	103.99227033000925
the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
	188.5882046896459
from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
	125.97327561429728
confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
	180.7380403085098
before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
	227.54881483835547
connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
	299.49310784846955
as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
	159.25074954991308
returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
	332.88624664855223
sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
	204.24831171617245
coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
	190.02712737696984
that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
	156.70450056194235
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
	171.79911728178251
my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
	200.86888923558467
enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
	299.640402160945
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
	203.5470945242983
would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
	124.35891459493966
seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
	164.2550275771065
He had before believed her to return his
	90.44276755890374
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
	272.70938420890275
great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
	273.71674785973704
than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
	180.08496083845387
himself, was no very difficult point.	142.52028117856415
To persuade him against
	176.10828908331678
returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
	189.7003572264057
was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
	177.35271559142416
having done thus much.	166.32956359594928
There is but one part of my conduct in the
	82.95261765358305
whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
	184.46536822565443
that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
	215.28521937254357
conceal from him your sister's being in town.	101.54295279504268
I knew it myself, as
	101.49980601952466
perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
	136.80186029440728
extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
	137.39492477403587
concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
	258.8956766499144
and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
	163.57582746926244
to say, no other apology to offer.	156.75761638028294
feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
	128.74432398755133
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
	206.76195976095505
not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
	207.12408996793684
weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.	398.7566704008605
Wickham, I can only
	215.50390291645158
refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
	103.55207565633863
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
	287.4034994141636
of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
	263.7931933302613
respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
	104.23393499767907
Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
	146.69024825046404
George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
	208.90107845148603
liberally bestowed.	173.147301257877
My father supported him at school, and
	189.59279904022856
afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
	218.52484012482094
father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
	123.46511019016137
been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	146.49453952089556
My father was not
	59.23796430987179
only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
	189.85820012489845
engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
	104.34703179717437
church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	112.73651378373111
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
	187.63445426864396
of him in a very different manner.	91.21948109579318
The vicious propensities--the
	367.938453977114
want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
	143.19765938537756
of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
	126.85347481403063
of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
	146.14026268444658
seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.	256.0798899767971
Darcy could not have.	52.47662329786367
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	193.44854595518092
Wickham has created, a
	135.9406381353323
real character.	88.35155010407695
It adds even another motive.	435.56617215555184
My excellent father
	175.96226493139284
died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.	209.57474203586384
the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
	135.74437546134016
to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
	121.44291345619789
profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
	164.12269849259349
valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
	119.538562421677
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	172.98866820183665
His own
	63.785417592320925
father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
	212.4743450590753
events, Mr.	227.5647962113789
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
	199.9990615459617
resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
	251.8610410031242
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
	180.01812625618155
advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
	92.96471819970195
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
	156.35583357270883
and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
	171.06211082191757
be a very insufficient support therein.	285.20069626979017
I rather wished, than
	180.6438280240662
believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
	123.27909155694296
accede to his proposal.	79.68367042021471
Wickham ought not to be a
	56.29199708039288
The business was therefore soon settled.	168.59634690835745
He resigned all
	162.52132406403618
claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
	93.59634579400293
ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
	109.32994380218307
thousand pounds.	99.08019874965672
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	374.7604648170018
thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
	151.6746128596116
society in town.	64.43193965201569
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
	254.40512895850685
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
	169.99392958077084
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
	109.02501368136309
to me again by letter for the presentation.	122.75398291186457
His circumstances, he
	96.38724039291081
assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
	143.42633621984365
exceedingly bad.	145.04801654311245
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
	204.58509894942884
present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
	99.1833770315813
could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
	136.56542012362414
person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
	167.74858307850602
father's intentions.	156.45832984613847
You will hardly blame me for refusing to
	165.70218638941884
comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	185.85788180110646
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
	99.61020417079608
circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
	121.51197261179989
After this period, every
	141.3489074681579
appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	121.77445408659203
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	238.99820813451743
must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
	211.70049902303504
me to unfold to any human being.	158.44728611026565
Having said thus much, I feel no
	254.3820776379511
doubt of your secrecy.	96.7812761296444
My sister, who is more than ten years my
	151.5875710581686
junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
	144.4267692995081
Fitzwilliam, and myself.	56.94321705255004
About a year ago, she was taken from
	125.60606129305664
school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
	140.94711414454127
summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
	148.6658069589846
and thither also went Mr.	479.62452034896864
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
	171.819939660707
proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	147.1200192361405
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
	181.11582680931858
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
	248.77578392817662
kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
	75.7739885988447
herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	101.43546065200654
She was then but
	60.56608264168423
imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
	176.79086786548396
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
	158.42081344153107
intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
	214.4257642967187
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
	176.95610993393902
a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	98.57310621047517
You may imagine what I felt
	269.4615847387799
and how I acted.	392.410477888545
prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr.	371.79350044018946
Wickham, who left
	112.20220247312804
Younge was of course removed from
	100.46013739855512
her charge.	144.00939636698936
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
	207.65815844835214
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
	115.14163384132236
strong inducement.	194.55823371946812
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	240.0569486200979
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
	187.35478196026105
have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
	165.09654066175963
it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
	311.6574600213092
I know not in what manner, under what form of
	123.34968193101744
falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
	110.21605065575457
be wondered at.	135.97279391442092
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
	106.89799253186227
suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	114.12575842638594
You may possibly
	190.6701856267021
wonder why all this was not told you last night.	126.03138050223772
But I was not then
	124.76406333768814
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	119.29657748930407
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
	240.91149240461584
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
	187.8570045954482
near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
	148.27006389706753
with every particular of these transactions.	205.27000487762996
If your abhorrence of
	108.06408904376846
_me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
	306.09600635964006
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
	130.1685852124184
be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
	199.11463670344938
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
	147.45034355533178
of the morning.	51.008326637488
I will only add, God bless you.	330.3297967714697
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."
	227.5647962113789
CHAPTER XIII.	227.5647962113789
If Elizabeth, when Mr.	383.5602540077429
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	143.35958292610246
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	167.34499590040213
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	138.39218054260607
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	149.09293582579355
With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield.	178.9325434278243
She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	166.65182226100532
His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	146.44169145331787
He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	180.12039397335246
It
was all pride and insolence.	127.4065242035476
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	256.00988636507316
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	213.00493937265892
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	165.75321405229272
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.	146.6096713382302
Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	193.58248516642934
What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	148.498268720514
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	219.66698604165535
She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	221.37527503326132
On both sides it was only assertion.	204.75399639404012
Again she read on.	80.56523240647711
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr.	225.40299356497766
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	198.35342377753668
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr.	242.7343980489614
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	183.42117450422438
She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	159.6451901026876
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	153.7109169951061
His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	170.3634314349416
She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.	322.853845071182
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	218.35026102294157
But no
such recollection befriended her.	195.25837735996626
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	167.92451762349114
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	208.8156239603558
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	207.9639801640323
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.	163.6143505390132
Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	157.30598776821844
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.	206.41258119745157
Philips's.	40.77723074686394
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	150.96980411645922
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	162.6704375135254
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	152.47386566468649
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr.	190.87352454340717
Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week.	215.5981298992037
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.	194.18970145070318
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	148.09028101211658
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	224.98932547441214
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	186.03727750154363
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.	382.78955926918496
Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr.	115.30939798927444
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	208.9506839853068
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	184.86838166403217
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr.	193.57824562359838
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	388.84821619535177
Till this moment, I never knew myself."
	266.7730095707395
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.	192.4130401782025
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	186.3695258773335
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	199.69680934387287
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	154.1136804849325
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	201.7104814313809
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	99.94083020822666
It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	178.82561634682483
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	197.14671211467657
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	186.1292682873923
She could think only of her letter.	83.05408737425097
CHAPTER XIV.	227.5647962113789
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr.	246.4328570171153
To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	193.93152478502358
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	158.02711686954427
"What would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.	139.18398960901334
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are.	204.11626043391757
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	309.05442411007215
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	146.18460552157393
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,
	207.43620701122654
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	114.26330867367595
Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."
	164.9254854266904
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
next Saturday."
	174.51108292523907
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	176.77118568110268
I expected
you to stay two months.	158.58603003600277
I told Mrs.	286.5559440376976
Collins so before you came.	94.2183938464429
There
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	127.16092061763341
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."
	202.3272283483286
"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."
	271.201658962777
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	151.90672537186254
And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
	175.2471583180596
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."
	369.55169622563443
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	479.8238650991941
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	115.61600561587503
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	295.81294936440395
It is highly improper.	243.46823499780942
You must contrive to send
somebody.	250.5658963053169
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	181.18218669206294
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.	285.72201111174223
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
am excessively attentive to all those things.	251.8288404339399
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs.	240.8347156863066
I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."
	144.61784715714862
"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	339.43444552263975
Where shall you change
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to."
	234.19491874560666
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	174.41782039504133
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	121.41526147876017
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	310.6563779552518
When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	187.43757845553787
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	210.7842748978037
In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	183.35245635076777
They were hopeless of remedy.	201.07462853999468
Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	214.91435238123097
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	215.04709559468193
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	214.8573751645674
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	176.61660766687612
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.	334.8458245044441
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	226.34445638689996
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!
	190.55656595008634
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	189.52622079734016
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	157.56500358447042
The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	205.14847606353317
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	282.23646648898324
CHAPTER XV.	227.5647962113789
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr.	418.9303581704574
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	225.34134827490283
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.	300.00967458732
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	156.83092007463347
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	206.2420954263605
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	178.6129795879335
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	131.1892563533799
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	176.95518671063013
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,
	164.77615118759147
"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	153.73446145123555
We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	272.9855033738833
Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	238.02152355210168
You see on
what a footing we are.	141.89797781170296
You see how continually we are engaged there.	211.37191596010263
In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."
	250.12089266822912
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	183.60418151476497
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	234.93812431792065
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	116.61673826577233
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	260.5021036762254
Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	171.21514082381938
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	275.9110400913388
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	171.61058448500793
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	171.1551453737658
We seem to have been designed for each
other."
	146.44614806496037
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	181.0147542407487
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	127.36630163358932
After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr.	230.35521349731664
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr.	145.75661455110014
Gardiner, though unknown.	187.04083746004187
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	194.40042428870836
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."
	154.80283164998843
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"
	231.64791881220287
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	174.85052955812557
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"
	484.7035085883195
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."
	322.7500374182875
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.	302.9544971354167
Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	134.27358263785862
But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	159.75057975767606
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.	180.7946583412078
To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	170.6737854099819
CHAPTER XVI.	227.5647962113789
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.	220.42916385957605
Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	248.7750249923866
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	306.7434548813199
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice?	506.4971220975537
is not this an agreeable surprise?"
	134.32329563395942
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	165.40717393350434
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable.	274.8240406980868
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."
	181.1774575253141
"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	199.4843755600708
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	237.6017236468436
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	219.20880906544426
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."
	272.35585632034656
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.	209.8934407731723
"What do you think?	72.25068979449539
It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."
	207.97755134260873
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	151.91838726077407
Lydia laughed, and said,
	103.78249958990662
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	182.7971238007398
You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say.	261.9512780158877
But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone.	233.7952114070431
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	160.3491835517566
Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	136.52628958189126
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	313.46744928054795
There's for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	158.94845309674642
Wickham is safe."
	132.36360157624793
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."
	370.24800215414535
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
	152.02992818271196
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	289.03360927167444
"I am sure there is not on _his_.	118.91372160616989
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	185.40808485344488
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!
	225.57323473607724
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	214.82053883422716
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	402.0997784767121
"I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	247.51220769888457
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	142.61497835280815
Have you seen any pleasant men?	186.44739841730367
Have you had any
flirting?	119.5945257903585
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	123.09654516784987
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	335.02397364122396
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	265.0257562309511
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.	353.58772495280436
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	127.8324640494332
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	154.6228878635295
Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	176.53450412208028
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs.	102.44312933043277
Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs.	133.55007241195995
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	145.61191328622135
We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	252.35610854499754
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	162.26563015013485
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	267.85815000395405
I thought I should have died.	294.91332178875336
And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
	166.35875986657172
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn.	275.9510105161153
Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	165.85552970023426
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.	308.16100190082545
Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,
	237.63982905241042
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."
	222.79026688323398
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	222.3658888780615
Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	217.4936768766155
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	199.97167238323385
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
we never should have got into the coach.	203.216674234031
I was ready to die of laughter.	168.56495289501726
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"
	223.3942580728325
To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	237.06400678727223
They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	280.91244442206454
But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	247.2702590390629
I should infinitely prefer a book."
	295.1959452743114
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	144.01501538076212
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	174.21318606795316
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	205.61280175914195
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	124.71879411322858
There was
another reason too for her opposition.	160.8027479613966
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	177.83999815294433
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	207.3159988489613
In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	126.85791247431793
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	199.4960152213499
Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	192.9417554655601
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.	165.8859109581846
Darcy and herself.	46.29238792114845
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	282.25119103180674
She was
sorry that Mr.	155.72085961988392
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	165.68016434601333
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."
	161.77260237857635
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
	153.40575016161975
"Blame you! Oh, no."
	136.05215281103418
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."
	216.52407920338464
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
	136.43660872737033
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	243.93914806001786
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	215.80444322946624
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.	137.93421762793093
"You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	106.40253936919682
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	124.2044212928001
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	173.66908047674556
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.	218.78646672057636
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."
	97.15280082459095
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	188.75063332807198
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.	148.04810019122425
And poor Mr.	329.9970627192459
Darcy! dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	218.92777320643964
Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of
his sister! It is really too distressing.	146.2212490192156
I am sure you must feel it
so."
	105.37775131749
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	156.98099078445705
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	264.078806244341
Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."
	244.60315321260273
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner."
	181.59326178492236
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	186.65283384625005
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."
	90.98583839110418
"I never thought Mr.	243.11254409725873
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	226.98433145083968
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	148.58482033186704
One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."
	240.35152820336162
"Indeed I could not.	130.82716343317946
I was uncomfortable enough.	149.77960120543398
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	273.66779145090624
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"
	206.61638455766433
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr.	217.7283252399989
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."
	318.5097236565606
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	202.87318634673215
There is
one point, on which I want your advice.	221.35678589747636
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	248.44285164196117
What is your own opinion?"
	109.36671052531041
"That it ought not to be attempted.	95.80232785961289
Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	174.90709835386994
The general prejudice against Mr.	449.6962347437357
I am not equal to it.	72.00141949656208
Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	140.711587192451
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	170.741223249611
"You are quite right.	153.77595425748467
To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	212.65384454082678
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	173.45086185837908
We must not make him desperate."
	141.72934540040194
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	249.19695555787166
But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	304.3764860513898
She dared not relate the other
half of Mr.	188.21936634654057
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	152.00938024405374
Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	204.44129008553992
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"
	259.9522165939992
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	144.73896948746423
Jane was not happy.	64.23463519361987
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley.	298.8471290793969
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	182.7726183299412
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.	378.2632775783999
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's?	193.13970000061488
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	152.81476557180537
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	224.65786680096318
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."
	146.2803044627797
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."
	151.07671348073404
"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	126.82554400948555
Nobody wants him to come.	114.70356520782252
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it.	190.9293460549159
Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."
	186.45909746660288
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	186.50776655604628
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	207.6175771011261
Well, well, I only hope it
will last.	183.69841979985753
And what sort of table do they keep?	153.4851062136264
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say.	349.9382581685721
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."
	392.4877265282287
"No, nothing at all."
	74.66065101008988
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	202.1183595522161
Yes, yes.	87.18848383669449
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	195.08350508386343
_They_ will never be distressed
for money.	151.26994220380533
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	242.52829686324182
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."
	259.67960357331395
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
	102.20405216438151
It would have been strange if they had.	108.18234816736917
But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	218.35402906830905
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	137.0954813279857
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."
	130.492781445625
CHAPTER XVIII.	227.5647962113789
The first week of their return was soon gone.	144.45406171521938
The second began.	196.99923339628316
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	333.82763133647717
Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	225.20048825304679
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	220.39897403620657
"How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"
	177.60224854778036
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	277.7734272833864
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar's regiment went away.	297.4402156233088
I thought I should have broke my heart."
	268.8054826961954
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.	484.66255957293333
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.	225.9923847019605
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."
	244.73592078705315
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."
	282.4370430660947
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.	195.8225521520087
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house.	345.10880195474897
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	154.09213944008025
She felt anew the justice of Mr.	253.9637671559372
Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	126.02388281191764
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	108.9807389353332
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	180.71530744097933
A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	202.23679326874296
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.	272.63144263681255
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	139.63898323021914
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	277.56081149885443
"I cannot see why Mrs.	296.1388083081606
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.	226.66559381029344
I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."
	163.2621510550525
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	154.02938901868345
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	165.8227360630979
He heard her attentively, and then said,
	128.20362019760475
"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."
	164.79256172106795
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."
	226.8237252990012
"Already arisen!" repeated Mr.	619.060948811279
"What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	173.88311378461862
Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	247.07677071779
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."
	270.74702137698034
"Indeed you are mistaken.	95.60432245879157
I have no such injuries to resent.	167.4934238446697
It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	206.32084199071977
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character.	239.11348230285614
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.	250.67415904261443
If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	136.44886571316727
Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	157.58165181294189
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	269.973348291096
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended.	365.64345106177063
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	636.6889628354618
Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"
	203.77162709599452
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,
	137.5166913366947
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	176.96554770606429
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters.	184.026578755599
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton.	250.29428319377436
Let her go then.	87.81614847119825
At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	177.63761313144246
The officers will find
women better worth their notice.	325.78751314847403
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	169.41023136468704
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	160.5928299982805
It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	143.23200392206002
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	228.33887982267652
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	202.93043424184148
She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	148.8973636608706
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	296.98498105257727
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	163.74871583451758
They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	141.2565506286532
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	151.39891392164273
Elizabeth was now to see Mr.	113.99084493608669
Wickham for the last time.	69.38741443120847
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	222.32989563743072
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	194.53937061505255
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	199.95057733137978
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	212.48250329087853
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr.	170.59528187295288
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	172.26125583287677
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	144.53157388847148
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?"
	181.58057689354212
"Nearly three weeks."
	198.72207801877906
"And you saw him frequently?"
	121.79007174432485
"Yes, almost every day."
	138.3582189685097
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."
	145.35394273784797
"Yes, very different.	106.77243015816111
But I think Mr.	422.9652715657364
Darcy improves on acquaintance."
	250.74994311656076
"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	155.596867742796
"And pray
may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
address that he improves?	290.93244592516817
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	206.1005882984756
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."
	202.84139877194195
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."
	172.1727238774824
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	248.1229096519791
There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,
	163.03073595520056
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,
	192.09683573014777
"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr.	196.69951524887733
Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	249.57174997312416
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	189.8033614870693
I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	211.88731085201508
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart."
	204.08802265656263
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	137.82494920575792
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	120.86713590397916
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	206.62866805150006
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	329.80931199910646
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	177.69468300833668
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	209.07810509632003
Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	210.748058147181
CHAPTER XIX.	227.5647962113789
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	223.1247196234211
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	222.77588411339474
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	213.41147210019653
Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	177.27862942038388
He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	176.96231853687
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	174.4844964926366
This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	185.563218593512
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	118.79158255006034
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	193.76889007583108
But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	223.03511946603547
Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	245.77943046763994
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	168.61916466124083
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	193.50289458256142
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	131.06262193115938
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	199.6753598442011
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	250.00712160263424
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."
	274.25396530917294
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs.	186.77665729459744
Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	150.79219729666343
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.	237.7454370411998
Everything wore
a happier aspect.	451.1844729316217
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	235.49836964963404
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.	246.7749585845696
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs.	200.74982394566493
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	341.4125909106794
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	185.64289600773574
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs.	140.22918347682327
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	215.39513998232962
The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.	196.45853962112446
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	167.81260370168116
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	213.48181044412732
It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner.	137.63152047910924
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
	297.719269195469
But they did pass away, and Mr.	191.06304072395676
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn.	233.18952150426577
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	233.64297248230645
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	271.18785124393753
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	292.88070466265594
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.	291.85301011643656
are
sufficiently known.	267.99434521231484
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern.	179.98663052829275
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.	153.11658818652566
Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	267.70562099787253
It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	143.1127405722843
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	254.87776931952118
Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	140.85336582289176
Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	188.6679159720042
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?" said her aunt.	101.22007617947622
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	147.84826708854072
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."
	135.6787842239181
Elizabeth was distressed.	102.12155803400888
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	147.47055291020828
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	231.26286099610456
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	310.3723727142788
"If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	232.1132263230715
They have some of the finest woods in the
country."
	112.7872739518747
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	126.23796420239843
The
possibility of meeting Mr.	280.6253259543315
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	288.4009936876103
But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	159.31933946237754
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	169.71012200881492
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	147.2295985321004
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	144.61207435372305

CHAPTER I.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	202.47354176069697
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	223.95506152616528
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	289.23017773521053
They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	282.43730723214526
It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	336.77427678464267
Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	681.5595869927092
Elizabeth was delighted.	89.05058052612355
She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	207.13682777421292
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	220.6288813592523
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	150.4591281094917
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	233.37156142339717
They
followed her into the dining-parlour.	162.12976932005674
It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	310.21727896440945
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	247.69504186802723
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	309.4699268927942
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	156.57286445122702
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	273.15393157560493
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	241.5559678601143
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."
	210.31099854938188
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	161.36304278834268
At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	184.5308427756189
Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
	185.31231849522942
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	134.2384717329963
She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr.	198.31701931294037
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	182.3162573705007
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."
	192.26099308990504
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.	138.6442876723756
"And that," said Mrs.	138.54000925703167
It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."
	161.44998300944437
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.	193.36721148281146
Gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	136.21146596984244
But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."
	163.99033449558618
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	197.87363833876984
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"
	146.22289355610874
This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	178.45961331290718
He was very fond of them."
	81.89755659301707
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.	336.26871587544036
Wickham's being among them.	132.56329588850124
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	267.5550373622529
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr.	240.04674686424522
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.	241.75130728850382
In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."
	155.89700745013664
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	296.83770563273777
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	159.6966364445109
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."
	263.6436253207713
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."
	269.77137342387806
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
	127.61920688765233
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	185.62006712895703
I do not know who is
good enough for him."
	100.85686192691364
Gardiner smiled.	143.6423116441048
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."
	159.36319614057626
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old."
	201.98592478615126
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	169.96513127484963
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	131.22885759527122
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,
	163.55730423315313
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	124.06563119965502
You are lucky in
having such a master."
	158.79988309783886
"Yes, Sir, I know I am.	488.2866787955629
If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better.	155.74866143263318
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."
	244.46541414100832
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.	254.64068962970805
Darcy!" thought she.	66.24191667715536
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	200.5017598650357
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."
	143.61465795792037
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	221.19995530550995
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	129.98307231193306
She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	129.4832270026263
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	200.13900363554023
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	140.73726907281954
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	133.09518134842824
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it.	219.43217720555606
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."
	201.30688927277694
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.	254.5809891602323
"Perhaps we might be deceived."
	134.87711382091467
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."
	155.4776338470895
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley.	260.728229591746
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	150.7380227269179
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	286.1749008367301
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	122.48289570220672
There
is nothing he would not do for her."
	70.13060800513357
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	196.80999611937008
In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	263.90682451667635
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	147.25631399193338
Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	121.50944851004648
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	125.57542006130785
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	175.58180721062135
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.	281.9770819867153
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	131.6288926108399
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	217.0841642905634
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	187.6969503293356
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	169.13953211074113
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	197.64417193361717
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	170.86268652534787
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	228.08627690454898
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	244.64089571471214
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	244.7313074918049
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr.	175.90239313127844
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	189.45220043763723
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	198.36082498402808
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	151.94435830304542
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	168.47620575922735
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	224.58686249382134
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	189.11837962705437
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	198.40246739395937
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	143.50183208333556
Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	177.33153421826717
That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	169.10080252265487
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	179.2799904740053
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	164.94439656589373
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.	287.76124782643967
Darcy then
was.	58.59560719721669
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	111.32628935646382
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	160.26478675657893
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	151.51443766482728
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	244.55662360516317
Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	185.75296404571662
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	196.32778941723004
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	237.3724117686283
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	255.83600799660766
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	251.85906825978657
Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr.	193.60081835450103
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.	170.4591022508842
Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	152.73238964195124
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	175.84619883954653
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	206.2010944977021
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	211.42187412321883
With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	188.24780780018983
Her colour
changed, and she said no more.	139.58619900932067
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	119.90735200746141
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	157.49640163111295
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	167.05923882154804
That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr.	211.20751314567516
Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	104.42542829984252
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	146.24683869299076
She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	199.12927504426173
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr.	262.10151131442433
Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	218.38183071526396
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	119.93308594665214
Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	228.20094472919112
From
what can it proceed?	136.28666986029833
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	185.76951591897554
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	187.8671290863
It is impossible that he should still love
me."
	124.2683335728255
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	229.52192888766479
It originated in
Mrs.	334.72026666358676
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	225.27772906442934
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	131.65256121617594
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	145.75119299956918
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	153.54991009407954
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr.	198.97252351673137
Bingley and his sisters."
	56.864635357054794
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	187.2419767326029
Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr.	227.61817139084775
Bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	195.4511174558207
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"
	191.15002927806302
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	114.32866870856563
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	154.52673157806672
Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	110.02757045518541
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	103.01412336881317
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	164.74604919759543
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	152.0126409238986
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	118.29080843105649
She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	196.55889404048037
At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance.	199.52386168459043
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	227.79745427115157
On
Mr.	227.5647962113789
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	168.88499754945167
Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	223.7145079719847
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	142.89537489155714
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	144.54040457519815
I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it."
	173.3450372975354
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	116.34583411878856
It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	138.59856470530434
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."
	211.14714219023546
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	186.82738944726103
But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"
	109.26806524488002
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	151.19237355282988
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."
	222.49822896644923
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	143.51850201110057
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.	151.15391995540276
Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	176.44277851675304
He has not an ill-natured
look.	180.5594062342286
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	217.27243063446238
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	146.1160506351094
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	229.6944178537943
But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."
	209.67620291366418
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	164.2882594590192
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	178.67766885977045
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	159.11064028841213
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.	157.54128807925989
Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	102.9403183702497
CHAPTER II.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr.	131.8840225720344
Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	123.85015927221524
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	210.05243133743272
They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	148.98710545144516
Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	221.44710121181268
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	129.88566893837452
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	165.5714186796596
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	188.4062994305863
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	237.89831392607022
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	184.6236266152166
Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	178.53247055892098
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	191.25148975619348
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	253.31970067041652
She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	151.98455775298552
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.	189.23029765474118
Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	193.14098058809904
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	162.05619949796832
All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	208.7221641601933
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	162.04906019730865
To Mr.	227.5647962113789
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	157.59526933615024
They had long wished to see him.	98.74079531837691
The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	244.3122605373175
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	197.3389549067491
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	160.40756610695988
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	75.35273228409895
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	140.56098693398638
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	205.40064421833986
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	174.43526695175802
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	166.11733028071103
But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	167.31957030967135
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	262.79105475169064
Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	145.61939308542281
On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	199.77089207632733
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months.	134.9253583044344
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
	216.48654416266203
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	174.5422364698444
There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	127.48809095205918
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.	123.3276563558636
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	224.64941567889593
When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	199.62441338925598
Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.	207.56167114200267
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr.	164.7710347733044
Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	249.30826441767502
Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	184.53000819136423
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	169.78427162842098
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	179.9970431033704
But she had no reason to fear Mr.	139.38564346188514
Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	126.33241251608759
It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr.	146.22741078759688
Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	88.25579896389573
They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	176.80954459646026
Of Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	124.15005668177548
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr.	167.72535453211762
There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	191.9653817559404
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	228.00342647165155
It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	133.3712935469147
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr.	201.99855471048934
Darcy afterwards discharged.	350.4960220001317
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	184.88341676220506
She
certainly did not hate him.	146.65916529049372
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	185.34478322469184
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	212.39068043032273
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	162.20001216117106
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	218.19690406370464
He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	209.13456877382146
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning.	159.55776783927374
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	134.26979969679633
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	176.8068398844902
The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	199.61855643549669
CHAPTER III.	227.5647962113789
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	170.61148855769878
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	304.4835418478338
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	310.2573683560771
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs.	233.21669138893557
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London.	173.21097328837413
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	198.55042292570104
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	125.0259667248609
By Mrs.	227.5647962113789
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	228.77160076335034
It was first broken by Mrs.	225.9851372189065
Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs.	206.49908793316203
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	191.36919232225776
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention.	219.23754085276374
This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	143.46440074359487
Her own thoughts were employing her.	194.38187383765597
She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	125.65021993117385
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	230.8770120001654
She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	148.98313897358548
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs.	255.09662121928105
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	164.87854423975347
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	208.2697573489996
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.	256.2131975652132
Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	129.24992697644305
He had been some time with Mr.	134.09836628655307
Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning.	140.39155731847165
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	179.80114364558216
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr.	214.68955632434782
Darcy were by no means over.	114.28424401749308
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,
	197.57971715873543
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	361.8248682662516
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	288.7094625430526
Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	199.7027077597894
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement.	294.0794377479884
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	214.91744871847882
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	293.59873477003333
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	179.67785198629542
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr.	228.49088703963469
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	277.6958962543484
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	191.83953269788245
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	168.73857882369987
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.	473.96835756459075
Darcy," she cried; "I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	159.86905150266128
However little Mr.	228.35510318476688
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	262.16682607479925
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her.	224.96397307960703
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	197.4398047453822
Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	336.56342488576007
Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	186.2234833496252
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	226.28424453936293
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,
	173.21215191490705
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."
	235.59961358736717
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
	202.23588309196862
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	163.94871008662633
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	188.6090015882139
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.	182.14590936483827
Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs.	102.56402857356233
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	154.28991945784145
CHAPTER IV.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	164.62570260663753
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	178.3723094609557
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	156.30754921452606
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	209.32525728483637
The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	244.02097740392028
It was to this effect:
	73.88043730860957
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
	296.7803799942959
you--be assured that we are all well.	108.89502020347666
What I have to say relates to
	146.37583969568567
poor Lydia.	227.5647962113789
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
	232.4152990002569
all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
	185.60626133097202
gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
	116.00038060618415
with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	536.2505720114987
seem so wholly unexpected.	214.56401058614873
I am very, very sorry.	120.46558753928159
match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
	209.05242536564512
his character has been misunderstood.	197.74377426645736
Thoughtless and indiscreet I
	291.3028161052755
can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
	191.08953970184652
His choice is disinterested at least,
	224.47785742245986
Our poor mother
	150.8352758597865
is sadly grieved.	417.8726820474018
My father bears it better.	205.61597990010327
How thankful am I,
	351.3776966856758
that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
	148.87181214603797
forget it ourselves.	116.72692362149041
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
	308.73176091889366
is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
	248.47592959708945
The express was sent off directly.	256.29091816648776
My dear Lizzy, they must
	184.5181209360276
have passed within ten miles of us.	227.3286837625166
Colonel Forster gives us reason
	438.8304017994624
to expect him here soon.	153.4117578361641
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
	142.17767330389626
informing her of their intention.	76.40040842540535
I must conclude, for I cannot be
	221.07674237052683
I am afraid you will not be able to make
	92.89805435319325
it out, but I hardly know what I have written."
	278.647339782899
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	207.45655305771652
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
	158.41791538351595
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
	180.55986637861918
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
	215.96505182415382
for being coherent.	245.69016513449296
Wickham and our poor Lydia
	209.03203218918318
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
	137.08604247339923
there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	138.3239175882374
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
	347.06340385185786
Though Lydia's short
	234.77795819241518
letter to Mrs.	110.94761333174382
gave them to understand that they were going to
	82.75787153297195
Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
	408.3509598968672
that W.	227.5647962113789
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
	142.28750462712875
was repeated to Colonel F.	326.6815628692444
who instantly taking the alarm, set off
	276.34079794556897
from B.	227.5647962113789
intending to trace their route.	189.68991988042114
He did trace them easily to
	169.3262538458337
Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
	158.4626899170434
into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
	204.1563638313368
from Epsom.	227.5647962113789
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
	101.96629759611129
to continue the London road.	297.50001020576013
After making
	114.09010314693543
every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	459.3555559225324
came on into
	75.5231724176324
Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
	192.95669452638305
people had been seen to pass through.	125.74924032330183
With the kindest concern he
	160.39445086969604
came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
	139.41259510567406
most creditable to his heart.	135.75125253411196
I am sincerely grieved for him and
	139.9629194105177
but no one can throw any blame on them.	176.984415663311
Our distress, my
	127.00983727083015
My father and mother believe the worst,
	124.85680466110767
Many circumstances might make it
	132.8810140220124
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
	129.18817247886238
pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
	198.7664287097586
against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
	151.9154707132314
can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.	217.30810642644562
I grieve to
	123.36036541159564
find, however, that Colonel F.	295.62379627004964
is not disposed to depend upon their
	141.2889910134599
marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
	186.95053873724052
feared W.	227.5647962113789
was not a man to be trusted.	77.43139950810071
My poor mother is really ill
	184.9489947065231
and keeps her room.	148.99363663771408
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
	120.4409105982521
saw him so affected.	111.32791513690466
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
	345.8637951692992
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
	119.51232090205053
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
	259.28303228591136
something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
	194.69530088847299
is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	248.14824037259874
I am not so
	62.3103022462387
selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	137.75397699806962
take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
	198.1207758857329
but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
	357.305482662841
you all to come here, as soon as possible.	103.0388506008908
I know my dear uncle and
	92.26142232941649
My father is going to
	87.53848891207002
he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
	229.39873880540344
will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
	153.83334077302118
way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
	199.43650850608873
to-morrow evening.	169.08100144056868
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
	170.0983459097269
assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
	90.9056848375176
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."
	366.06761990385075
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr.	185.11604122701638
Darcy appeared.	117.67425368879941
Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	304.21439866087087
I must find Mr.	253.236398448297
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."
	196.8668212496168
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.	242.06279317834924
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."
	144.81984262311326
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	201.6024320495819
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	252.67777085991793
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid.	209.47948724319338
"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	248.0800056117311
"There
is nothing the matter with me.	85.16502845452716
I am quite well.	117.00931183680348
I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."
	309.61486230549286
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	165.56483957149055
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	234.6793572671364
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news.	181.63629023076757
It cannot be concealed from any one.	145.40865375625154
My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr.	220.89867901290353
They are gone off together
from Brighton.	264.0906337115402
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	111.32190289345944
She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."
	157.89019533909777
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	120.4804611276975
"When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was.	227.19664716096136
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	196.93544922423214
But it is all, all too late now."
	116.1699993615893
But is it
certain, absolutely certain?"
	164.13174584967385
"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."
	287.571297495416
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"
	149.48674318840352
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	226.53240014444276
But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.	161.90879058807042
How is
such a man to be worked on?	89.83817351600996
How are they even to be discovered?	109.13376268146592
I have
not the smallest hope.	87.4868508637165
It is every way horrible!"
	194.69475921223994
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	282.19318305119907
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much.	340.93140804595714
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"
	384.4324896380564
Darcy made no answer.	118.54727678557937
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	212.97280918684368
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	171.69426680943934
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	278.76667212722504
It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	143.3042236367516
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	185.82882030587368
Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	226.11553834621935
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."
	222.87971864438688
"Oh, yes.	87.18848383669449
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	201.51515689233406
Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	377.72613126582485
Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."
	158.53375063910642
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	232.70628779705692
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	315.5126277390791
But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	221.9473863599755
Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	218.14992742559608
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	186.80938723341856
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	97.93420487724602
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	178.2775837783618
But now it was all too natural.	110.9637232553151
For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	215.29297300491083
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	182.67853549580164
Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	186.91847726258763
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	270.1466213977807
The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now
feel it.	274.2410201614918
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	176.11273679739773
Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	137.3344811199601
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.	174.38537939836422
Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	286.0497430498145
They were to be off as soon as possible.	85.34442209232412
"John told us Mr.	290.52643295863567
Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"
	103.1501941213507
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	169.9072076525111
_That_ is all settled."
	91.69179705533608
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	136.27343877841147
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"
	178.65488242764766
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	174.2203942352913
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.	231.34634269434824
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	157.0758909689916
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	203.95846568765418
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	211.78146793836268
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	145.06321422683803
Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	196.37609518832738
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk."
	170.74789861834395
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	228.12912985111134
"Upon my word," said Mrs.	199.2296574918131
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	145.14345707383498
I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham.	160.58601585615324
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"
	148.16109140418598
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	180.4425631934084
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable.	227.6601885656765
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
hope it.	185.81473659882357
"In the first place," replied Mr.	180.69999892824003
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."
	171.89683206044694
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."
	235.74278495580913
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London.	134.80044287703998
"But why all this secrecy?	175.3988795784614
Why any fear of detection?	178.89599401448737
Oh! no, no, this is not likely.	93.47793898929166
His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	169.7720742936814
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	177.95521981045957
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	272.2653986991732
As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	200.06029457508876
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."
	140.2258085042458
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	184.04616796502887
But, really, I know not what to say.	137.1460911652171
But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	159.8391876106885
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	146.04520513703096
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it?	162.6473157354419
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	153.5888598032737
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."
	192.41614177680776
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."
	139.60706084362852
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	294.7151127625089
And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	177.30304390414796
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is.	285.1444111795095
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	258.3065078112871
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."
	142.9547798804101
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs.	169.59484383459184
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	142.0729277048933
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.	393.2038598300833
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	163.72655142949597
And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	215.42766304766835
From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	312.8684530182999
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."
	109.52214952499992
Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"
	127.78187199363
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr.	184.23853365114
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself.	233.94294432901378
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	194.80737376790486
As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	166.8870012506888
And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	188.07248925953027
Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	119.38737013481332
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	184.02507522731185
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."
	218.48961361056675
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."
	192.64421339855934
"Not the slightest.	99.80525478787527
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	153.25677571523764
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	130.10806018961617
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."
	213.73996954440108
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	200.75840513604524
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	212.56808695361167
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	238.07382780167038
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	269.849004634886
It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	179.56009631258826
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	318.0400088010622
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	206.21809661793054
"Not yet," replied Jane.	297.8821450606998
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well."
	162.69383376909806
"Is my father in town?"
	90.33284300521211
"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."
	243.2905703645359
"And have you heard from him often?"
	100.8346811057914
"We have heard only once.	138.58988847817804
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do.	182.54177009223494
He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."
	141.66494156852275
"And my mother--How is she?	130.48907545186879
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	339.4498151783712
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	125.29835171282875
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.	176.54013146779687
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven! are quite well."
	289.8046286393074
"But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.	221.03706066581577
"You look pale.	293.65539800944134
How much you
must have gone through!"
	121.0181100729683
Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr.	166.21325147462244
Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	132.51005256930924
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	189.5648252680084
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	151.2268198186669
The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	195.33205121480572
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	260.48132563834383
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	164.09796352649505
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	119.03553643157892
I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.	179.05394121267165
Poor dear
child! And now here's Mr.	385.58898457018034
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do."
	169.39898213856682
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.	356.3167943665367
Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr.	131.80591347452938
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	245.6505095442499
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	141.43587323326904
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	181.78786522600066
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	156.77752149587442
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."
	169.5631049626274
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs.	216.48107025104352
Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for.	158.16289525624103
And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	179.13855480241688
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	175.78924851456273
Bennet from
fighting.	212.87762770537327
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	239.71146984870637
And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	172.08260275326492
Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."
	180.90502627534372
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	143.26577164321773
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	224.74293208869
One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	118.30141924992961
As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,
	191.22112859175888
"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	143.2020236633417
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."
	289.7163703369594
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."
	231.66753796346293
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	196.6302978677397
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	203.15953758336155
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	247.2556725825153
Give me farther particulars.	198.70264413553517
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	159.43633740659584
They must have seen them together for ever."
	130.56011650424583
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	219.59486877431664
I am so
grieved for him.	113.64037091027167
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	119.3260410217382
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	214.1190821056977
Did he know of
their intending to go off?	115.71699303214935
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"
	620.1481333338783
"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	218.01009533317173
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
	182.12723342434137
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"
	250.32031389807543
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	204.70680629587932
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	134.81201185743438
Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	163.05723522176845
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."
	145.8342643331169
"But not before they went to Brighton?"
	130.36359213853717
"No, I believe not."
	182.75674384797756
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	282.8250162354788
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did.	147.03381671001057
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	136.5388048927845
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"
	166.43257543565701
"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	93.05864876164674
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	227.24945186274525
We acted with the best intentions."
	205.35855366219016
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"
	270.67682373535655
"He brought it with him for us to see."
	88.72720600484357
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	168.57992498431616
These
were the contents:
	88.5237658645668
"MY DEAR HARRIET,
	532.9036398671572
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
	252.51434574994937
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
	168.2506705798106
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
	192.03370919357732
world I love, and he is an angel.	168.54733821655785
him, so think it no harm to be off.	110.06091075879785
Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
	82.16025199199461
surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
	230.11268495525138
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
	184.74171905087834
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
	187.2963736049255
engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	89.8991775491867
excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
	146.44154709232225
the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	196.19557939897282
I shall send for my
	117.47496354268236
packed up.	72.86283047554554
Good bye.	210.21672043550538
will drink to our good journey.	200.8321298329854
"Your affectionate friend,
	190.97362345913172
"LYDIA BENNET."
	227.5647962113789
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it.	365.90360059539074
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	90.41983966325756
But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	129.51076525016165
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	123.77326186423807
My poor father! how he must have felt it!"
	126.16275561375386
"I never saw any one so shocked.	169.18257522868976
He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	166.64507094956585
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"
	147.4881088133985
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"
	159.6335853925676
"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	160.6071177498689
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."
	244.94798789288265
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	141.1008211227174
You do not look
well.	105.60057350080879
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."
	148.90173822547632
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	175.40663997738193
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me.	201.83073099269885
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."
	154.14649590338794
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	218.95940674164254
Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	399.4474903093422
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
	159.34128179809008
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	158.94293776886315
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	240.07746814626447
His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	212.41487173339206
It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	182.05679182754906
If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	162.7248099492696
I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."
	147.19007456040018
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr.	155.67441339304017
Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	170.12900926514064
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	186.90674986290801
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	138.84033790461353
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	164.89683686804963
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr.	179.32407659761336
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	159.92811546833667
Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	103.30545220943536
Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	261.3880290499059
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	252.47597375833382
He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	181.0124810706225
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	141.84650243609053
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	179.58678150212927
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	187.63790984363015
That Mr.	227.5647962113789
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.	184.67967023741758
Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	171.54845172739672
Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	155.58391280224757
He added, that Mr.	187.00431914593054
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon.	226.23332262520148
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	179.0673487496012
If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	147.50068596309896
At present we
have nothing to guide us.	168.49636173612004
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	218.7138252292304
But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."
	262.46158583191993
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	155.51254961837267
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	153.02588749949416
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	124.94763432208646
The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	182.44585255757605
Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	178.62428625047482
But before they heard again from Mr.	195.53716774986663
Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.	199.17568509000554
Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	202.74249695706584
It was as
follows:
	87.89911782482605
"MY DEAR SIR,
	532.9036398671572
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
	231.48211968401196
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
	155.35636420582802
from Hertfordshire.	227.5647962113789
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	267.8544271248186
Collins and
	22.740540418306
kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	230.65759096085813
arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
	215.5688559954137
a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
	162.96379428182607
must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	155.13505009427672
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	118.0559652203281
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
	97.78492521847387
suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
	254.92162551226835
of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
	221.81807226502713
of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
	114.08655321044417
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
	137.690300642774
disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
	134.19127596666465
such an enormity, at so early an age.	230.53520976591707
Howsoever that may be, you
	58.10497129958809
are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
	212.61346634040453
by Mrs.	227.5647962113789
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
	146.8450748675382
They agree with me in
	97.3391688267363
apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
	142.71059566056954
injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
	85.48302222464997
Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
	479.5515180778365
with such a family.	69.32365972212045
November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
	156.0586180717874
all your sorrow and disgrace.	184.37845544169102
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
	195.90497050083644
to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
	220.06921176887235
child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
	109.28981353353497
fruits of her own heinous offence.	171.53017141291164
"I am, dear Sir, &c.	302.26752049687644
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	168.4297336461631
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	158.36469702442514
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	130.2064499502058
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	134.4000946150564
And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	212.42827060665752
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	236.1286557077836
He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	172.37135139406607
"This is
wholly unexpected.	206.58680152326133
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.	136.3363875370297
Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	169.01772188090132
Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	139.826238443011
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.	172.33772099522113
"Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them.	151.90796497048828
Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
	164.80848172808635
As Mrs.	227.5647962113789
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	244.54178176538508
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	142.60710521897624
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.	184.9020642296414
Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	135.58220682608828
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.	197.03612627279531
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	235.37737779446016
It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	172.94581506363863
When Mr.	227.5647962113789
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	167.96509129016164
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	107.99431227464262
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that.	178.22188301980816
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."
	157.73211987052724
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.	249.3187981547424
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	233.3801970230445
Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame.	250.08420323164233
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	149.71787618796512
It will pass away soon enough."
	195.9078755090063
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"
	176.5904265044508
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	267.24558205414166
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."
	174.1189860818922
Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."
	265.56640719715125
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	261.90499641365284
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."
	299.5665243035354
"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
	414.25848485736236
"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	248.02719691547378
No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	205.89275565574644
Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	199.1067055490699
And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."
	171.06641871120684
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	255.17717297360974
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	146.66431179167571
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."
	137.0775471974746
CHAPTER VII.	227.5647962113789
Two days after Mr.	301.57654083127557
"What do you mean, Hill?	184.31610249491223
We have heard nothing from town."
	134.8026876595864
"Dear madam," cried Mrs.	379.81252595437735
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr.	237.90096256830165
He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."
	148.1382955680489
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	144.49229255840368
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,
	158.69816591277169
"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."
	183.8781174683987
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	242.00564217295616
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,
	217.1840393877895
"Oh, Papa, what news?	258.10766721989023
what news?	111.62874613099045
have you heard from my uncle?"
	105.73611234564302
"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."
	137.6696766207963
"Well, and what news does it bring?	137.0295674909602
good or bad?"
	139.01777741211816
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."
	116.5306742430919
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	213.2712589965082
Jane now came up.	143.69873171344702
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."
	177.96117634469064
"Gracechurch-street, Monday,
	382.7505573646415
"MY DEAR BROTHER,
	532.9036398671572
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
	177.38817211648248
as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	193.01266922286194
Soon after
	62.355921568300765
you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
	201.65755227604046
part of London they were.	105.89268424176811
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	476.88991909171693
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
	168.29738399600026
"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"
	232.58473606498023
Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.	214.64653508875932
They are not married,
	89.59316310344899
nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
	140.12045026699298
willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
	168.58225647305707
All that is
	41.21450879945123
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
	93.38269920454191
equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
	247.4701078583645
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
	93.58012001714306
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
	168.95197889018513
life, one hundred pounds per annum.	546.4672483938939
These are conditions, which,
	191.02202481810895
considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
	187.62784817046736
I shall send this by
	133.1741518667187
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.	316.22332626213563
Wickham's
	40.77723074686394
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
	138.67359155780386
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
	159.40538464853475
say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
	157.58676110896715
discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	133.7431947431115
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
	230.10708565933496
in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
	192.95026397789644
immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
	248.61083575921577
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
	114.65111589352063
to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
	259.41690544978877
my diligence and care.	190.3848600682883
Send back your answer as soon as you can,
	117.24056374688568
We have judged it best, that my
	121.73948934266416
niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
	136.66896498766792
She comes to us to-day.	101.39614102958299
I shall write again as soon as any
	123.43571590079375
thing more is determined on.	106.91186439955375
"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	180.1452937293576
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"
	85.91778961377358
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	117.3432110795981
"My dear father, I congratulate you."
	279.3210373284352
"And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.	140.21491808595206
"No; but it must be done soon."
	85.92185459134691
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	162.63308268008643
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."
	145.7527441528617
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."
	175.06894511280615
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."
	109.10798134386637
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	140.7961230012199
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."
	284.71438400351104
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
	174.93261053870071
"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"
	248.1225292079675
"Yes, yes, they must marry.	148.4555825131857
"Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"
	248.29948299530025
"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."
	247.8930723156355
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	140.35421795909934
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself.	255.4719797988995
A small sum could not do all this."
	155.45519053153143
"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	215.7686474071052
I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."
	113.28529930811536
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"
	342.34361878859295
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	171.2969140783381
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	135.82662897227831
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"
	207.9600223363596
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	175.92070267034717
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	298.29852864916256
He has
children of his own, and may have more.	95.65493899911198
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"
	259.3816033025943
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr.	212.71906797934912
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	176.30433541980912
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	151.17837442666635
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	209.8508560680001
By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"
	186.34473598325192
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	220.33220941141212
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	158.74319474068898
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."
	272.9827962092572
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget.	290.6851885677574
It is useless to talk of it."
	93.89992541702422
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	140.67106203526774
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	109.06559784485965
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,
	231.15128370454275
"Just as you please."
	86.71116095826193
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"
	105.5516821843945
"Take whatever you like, and get away."
	145.71324161470594
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	201.4631432495405
Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	147.93684964136378
After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	203.1499066616659
As soon as Jane had read Mr.	256.96369482913923
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	183.59923912575866
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	99.5968630457859
She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	222.60383797261025
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing.	315.76945279008595
How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly.	236.63854109250704
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	126.4511872619077
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	286.9670693982258
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill.	270.21395002838545
I will put on my things in a moment.	122.66306927110452
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.	231.201935494668
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	194.86209646005432
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	181.38011323299528
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr.	231.4552947156232
Wickham with money."
	98.15292566986051
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	112.39239568593528
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	114.03041604531062
Well! I am so happy.	198.12387336449856
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	178.8022968809516
And she was only sixteen last June.	198.00463903369698
My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me.	294.0123014586025
We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."
	186.49187007054098
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	217.55593758835388
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	149.80159528008997
Other schemes too came into her head.	221.99942206958164
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips.	172.62667642609466
And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs.	436.9503661689642
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	181.89427153361945
An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	198.26421964114067
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton?	168.05357344344512
Oh! here comes Hill.	410.43933449659323
My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news?	161.59688024965956
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."
	158.09496677852357
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	179.542841398638
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	187.43440196468478
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	159.1238876949456
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	204.5610654402101
CHAPTER VIII.	227.5647962113789
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	179.74859829582613
He now wished it more than ever.	135.17095765195643
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	166.15078101660484
The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	213.0176730498026
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	142.6464991907145
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	141.98645870088646
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	173.44099912340175
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	146.1851354621388
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	211.69527210187437
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.	300.1808343521462
Bennet and
the children.	55.48701318751396
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	163.09487763753432
This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.	136.92171953347656
Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	146.13379961377595
In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	183.1536187683733
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	147.95277600800787
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	195.87911473166244
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	155.11371378424832
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	292.80416988036785
It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	196.4281811670136
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	205.54985527472002
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	167.8678635264593
It was a fortnight since Mrs.	177.6751853970711
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	209.2342631738421
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	211.07329205801943
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	231.10998916772382
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	208.55558116087445
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.	124.87820512862555
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	167.21641571179538
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	229.36098318821584
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
	189.47766642011948
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.	419.23124889253
Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs.	174.03670998897192
Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	196.73554007671868
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	165.4820590662164
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	139.4018801704547
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	206.95236384750075
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	191.52542025264847
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr.	137.64213872677794
Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	192.98339756109436
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	211.363292852828
There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	176.95157719371596
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	221.6765940208124
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr.	169.76708479871974
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	195.39055195959625
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	130.49449801908958
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	180.66032989944418
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	161.59000794418998
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	154.304465366611
She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	164.86377755526212
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	115.53229997439722
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	195.37373741364914
But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	147.26578408254977
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	145.34338285908518
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	173.3182852805813
It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	157.1566041243112
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	304.7626815155047
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	135.65422716152668
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	194.9367229911479
But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	270.18722012577786
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	124.70589215666038
To Mr.	227.5647962113789
Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	158.386932954418
The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr.	178.443027492915
Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.	188.35483941115575
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
	113.07542536589071
as his marriage was fixed on.	108.31803224227407
And I think you will agree with me,
	169.58793823499613
in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
	278.08999355289797
on his account and my niece's.	102.20802237724293
It is Mr.	159.61866480518856
Wickham's intention to go
	105.02529637912446
into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
	172.67497061205444
some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	145.19131214313524
He has the
	44.762141351064344
promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
	223.32229912976436
the North.	227.5647962113789
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
	98.98890897141247
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
	508.29148163368285
where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
	133.43831649152204
more prudent.	204.44802989115914
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
	172.60573363672947
our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
	136.9998449126944
various creditors of Mr.	259.50058888870814
Wickham in and near Brighton, with
	121.24563006923746
assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.	324.47233587747195
will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
	236.85272015633004
to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
	330.66407264618755
according to his information.	64.75482729696449
at least he has not deceived us.	139.8078494828447
Haggerston has our directions, and
	151.26074629893014
all will be completed in a week.	122.93662995101771
They will then join his regiment,
	175.78998520179385
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
	117.27543707430809
She is well, and begs to be dutifully
	134.98513966414484
remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.	105.20386482067298
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr.	188.103319176279
Gardiner could do.	65.84059613920942
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	80.0212235746314
Lydia's being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	167.64508763456033
"She is so fond of Mrs.	154.1851369015634
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	150.6067462868666
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."
	186.19181535428973
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative.	205.3802767956341
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	159.3159965380718
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North.	123.30291277499094
When Mr.	227.5647962113789
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	140.73841910919683
Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	148.31188062654743
CHAPTER IX.	227.5647962113789
The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	111.40911257658425
Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	220.15046415569313
They came.	82.22627230116932
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	134.43036083669162
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	236.27140945302168
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	139.94420612764924
Their reception from Mr.	324.9612901886264
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	142.54214371153142
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	263.9572919127803
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	169.53683932002338
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked.	295.4690196912249
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	611.5255818061378
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	163.8264039859829
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	166.27287766704123
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	204.30535742728154
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	282.9600773440842
There was no want of discourse.	115.424455181159
The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	227.9070982820182
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	156.40157636495422
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	214.2371135924996
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."
	302.931441846845
Her father lifted up his eyes.	235.5904445192548
Jane was distressed.	102.12155803400888
Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day?	270.7608668417564
I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing."
	229.55137164649508
Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	126.47245574779453
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."
	246.1349082112216
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	138.25131120960884
Her ease and good
spirits increased.	218.74311737007122
She longed to see Mrs.	216.54637750106355
Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.	164.34259802101974
Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.	142.86591929125615
Hill and the two housemaids.	100.69009170552388
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	112.468431799349
Is not he a charming man?	90.7298629437137
I only hope they may have half my
good luck.	174.98815761441642
They must all go to Brighton.	138.84670491854249
That is the place to get
husbands.	111.10907087610367
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."
	138.8001250535086
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	146.51083737797026
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off.	270.60876136876055
"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that.	125.58806448236582
I shall like it of all
things.	106.80697684454455
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	141.73454275745397
We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."
	202.81367835295612
"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.	127.35332617456353
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."
	203.0918152050265
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."
	219.65769104070728
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	193.72050091629634
Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	130.37843315388707
No one but Mrs.	157.30045242382812
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	149.69116688380123
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	148.5565598562074
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	163.19918107855537
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	149.75865982786536
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	108.31442125473957
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	130.4263143219262
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.	141.56706904787322
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,
	156.9998473494321
"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	320.37836670236885
Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"
	131.01822093872076
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."
	204.49137520294158
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	310.6003353549324
We were
married, you know, at St.	154.4191854412168
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	214.80719823975903
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	121.34474882967996
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	224.11241309323236
And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	179.70959997927972
However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	226.19897095561583
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	178.60742835717784
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	161.97976448335652
If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight.	263.10596467318226
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	170.99492320190862
To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	222.66132943645297
Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr.	156.11227899294204
And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	134.7598517118206
Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	139.296569642333
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	206.83911289849482
However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr.	289.9674198016612
Darcy might have done as well."
	101.1766800019429
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	113.90553912432048
But gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	233.45376021872033
I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	398.7064576430918
It was to be such a secret!"
	71.2305006770996
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	133.06662134991814
You may depend upon my seeking no further."
	294.4831239584053
"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."
	285.7615181108445
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."
	185.7065338259585
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	178.3520488185173
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	91.4116125074759
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	182.0850315102677
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	162.07079991212967
"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."
	184.54402889833787
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	212.1667960770946
She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	140.84660521095103
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.	382.7505573646415
"MY DEAR NIECE,
	532.9036398671572
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
	191.56870093503602
morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
	262.04118773447783
surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	196.43029860315312
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
	220.16265327377505
that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
	200.08491153048834
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
	139.77720713607337
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
	147.75428448081055
but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
	139.81790539145499
him to act as he has done.	102.4760935300654
ignorant, I must be more explicit.	246.61568428077544
On the very day of my coming
	76.03346222673846
home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	223.4384758204167
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	180.10964763510722
It was all
	42.96363437754629
over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
	281.42616507007347
as _your's_ seems to have been.	218.57439797436436
He came to tell Mr.	180.625075858228
Gardiner that
	30.531103659745323
he had found out where your sister and Mr.	163.6766470563378
Wickham were, and that
	40.989112482000714
he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
	256.87126344729876
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
	144.40440150969155
for them.	46.99124683499808
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
	188.87923805690593
owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
	140.24027920187893
known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
	105.58369214939151
to love or confide in him.	152.29343410769727
mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
	146.7932507043791
him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	172.53752486040935
His character
	91.97399744893224
was to speak for itself.	110.73532434822373
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
	163.85368318120257
forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
	153.4032955579488
by himself.	72.1128470350795
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
	293.0865775196313
disgrace him.	39.04795489186027
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
	102.51547221917968
more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
	114.64001170213174
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
	191.2242020078892
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
	166.87705583563192
She then took a large house in Edward-street,
	247.0997947610645
and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	366.6470746124152
This Mrs.	227.5647962113789
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
	120.34675116793998
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
	342.5148805813413
and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
	115.2825458127515
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
	105.53556692136893
London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
	95.98828172499594
would have taken up their abode with her.	140.8158031867138
At length, however, our
	200.1253243650543
kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	215.55049865247437
They were in ----
	43.98476253572931
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	380.7863980718745
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
	113.94933586922348
her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
	132.95252712280202
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
	90.16613298027029
offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	117.01273102475675
But he found Lydia
	189.8521667006366
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	145.36643158808323
of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
	93.23173239631004
leaving Wickham.	227.5647962113789
She was sure they should be married some time or
	120.92334136383052
other, and it did not much signify when.	100.72579575821398
obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
	130.7410013014111
which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
	132.3451840587268
ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	287.29329745539525
meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
	132.09170391041505
situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	128.28035956695336
somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
	88.87124272006758
nothing to live on.	75.47055496536576
sister at once.	85.79150557570169
Though Mr.	227.5647962113789
must have been benefited by marriage.	152.6001278427769
But he found, in reply to
	84.58219456396857
this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
	193.76787551074074
effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	171.67542346531192
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
	121.97141638890469
against the temptation of immediate relief.	179.92316151431444
for there was much to be discussed.	92.40113669055377
than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	128.97207015655528
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.	397.4885186838642
Darcy's next step was
	131.43174416754934
to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
	115.36096284023154
Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.	246.4415076403917
could not be seen, and Mr.	109.29890627627631
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
	238.23616012039807
your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
	127.05301345496613
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
	111.16752306847094
so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
	315.47823053787454
seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	105.85962754980348
He did not
	54.704244898539535
leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
	96.19575734836656
gentleman had called on business.	128.16118967761744
On Saturday he came again.	189.56223902600505
father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
	138.71770053494126
had a great deal of talk together.	129.43251274155207
They met again on Sunday, and
	166.61570912295446
then _I_ saw him too.	211.030941256016
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
	133.71253180549874
as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	127.45335637420072
But our visitor
	224.94733104648202
was very obstinate.	166.18758632433577
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
	249.3085373341695
He has been accused of many
	146.00117813189337
faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	176.0444513759401
Nothing was
	28.815781734504046
to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
	149.21962626534025
not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
	136.1781494442449
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	138.6760697222713
They battled it
	199.699295111569
together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
	106.10320438411117
or lady concerned in it deserved.	161.96020932351868
But at last your uncle was forced
	130.31342138820722
to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
	119.4575749169648
was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
	144.2496684128453
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
	305.36547747204173
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
	175.96071199543024
the praise where it was due.	159.27302803299912
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
	215.34123816049004
than yourself, or Jane at most.	206.4163845574425
You know pretty well, I suppose,
	321.01258902480356
what has been done for the young people.	112.70374817588986
His debts are to be paid,
	126.7577727211195
amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
	233.98938289051392
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
	137.96070872346684
commission purchased.	216.63048118484667
The reason why all this was to be done by him
	97.58737356880815
alone, was such as I have given above.	170.2735068406097
It was owing to him, to his
	67.17734457471794
reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
	190.20249003194849
had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
	105.59052926979058
received and noticed as he was.	71.70254981388449
Perhaps there was some truth in
	98.34755857564801
_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
	641.8676266641601
reserve, can be answerable for the event.	135.88570156530108
But in spite of all this
	70.4588125001499
fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
	225.7948829355975
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
	172.70792837812726
for _another interest_ in the affair.	239.07699497892008
When all this was resolved
	90.670804909793
on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
	145.24635208171614
Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
	117.76965492662802
when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
	155.3798980785634
receive the last finish.	128.86394929611848
I believe I have now told you every thing.	186.28383296143156
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	145.03231305546456
us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	160.1501531093772
exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
	184.46750062594444
would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
	192.52296684926648
while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
	214.0599470447041
last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
	143.25096939234362
piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
	130.80641030542446
fresh pain.	118.30236605985831
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
	128.97010559430527
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
	68.40381774120453
If she heard me,
	80.29936021038519
it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	167.96687600291907
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
	372.78952814515446
and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	159.00396453063817
Darcy was
	28.815781734504046
punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
	133.08597255845154
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
	125.59968424151974
on Wednesday or Thursday.	382.4954136873815
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
	98.40391145233107
Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
	271.2399050695447
enough to say before) how much I like him.	154.05381374773862
His behaviour to us has,
	106.12241533731329
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	158.11792062258817
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
	194.99199020995013
a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
	202.15430991294073
wife may teach him.	157.49515546153586
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
	181.46580911308413
mentioned your name.	114.12057795398805
me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
	191.9861952273391
I shall never be quite happy till I
	228.9033904748679
A low phaeton, with a nice little
	262.5585280184951
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	94.86661660462468
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	211.41293890893013
Your's, very
	58.22630447582024
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	237.61367675745444
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr.	359.89789714133445
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	189.36535336328123
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	170.68976591364324
Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	106.59288309567005
But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	200.88206864005093
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	233.1804123803369
He had to be sure done much.	80.55569445531881
She was ashamed to think how
much.	103.21808834333258
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	187.7884955917269
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	164.0790516044037
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	173.6599178326468
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	158.47278035705529
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	311.5768125230374
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	93.12039213247452
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	97.98957135322946
She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	133.34660343642997
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	105.87675346470142
She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr.	237.11581708059614
Darcy and herself.	46.29238792114845
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her.	238.1466426041193
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."
	145.12878807963799
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	115.56066561913256
Are the others coming out?"
	118.87081048843592
"I do not know.	68.03022871712685
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton.	143.2990105595316
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."
	205.6290279856974
She replied in the affirmative.	107.9235923622663
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	177.29339667626007
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	134.36834934485915
But of course she did not mention my name to you."
	93.66493664087496
"Yes, she did."
	52.06092150064603
"And what did she say?"
	86.02368234380222
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	122.0445776352419
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."
	245.8948934277049
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	206.94392337720063
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,
	151.42011644943483
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	189.47456674309882
We passed each other
several times.	290.8415303069628
I wonder what he can be doing there."
	137.83386072410497
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth.	356.81737624688424
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."
	125.65986802098504
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."
	180.9198291210976
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."
	105.53858736762248
"And do you like her?"
	73.74476967594771
"Very much."
	52.59336166347821
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	203.77149416356946
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	152.68083338421317
I am very glad
you liked her.	119.04635889469883
I hope she will turn out well."
	148.43360603484865
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."
	192.04297613282014
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"
	131.33252694780163
"I do not recollect that we did."
	123.35053647438629
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	132.89809434639122
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect."
	410.35319378299397
"How should you have liked making sermons?"
	211.84774807885537
"Exceedingly well.	59.6763808341638
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	122.50478615716646
One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be.	129.71494603264526
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"
	197.88331765851154
"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."
	227.37940078855445
"You have.	37.74178799228374
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."
	173.06942295130617
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."
	170.18045000250615
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,
	134.7443042595081
"Come, Mr.	227.5647962113789
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	100.11478933484132
Do not let us
quarrel about the past.	195.1451535075954
In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."
	207.01036805746986
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	190.41238896574188
CHAPTER XI.	227.5647962113789
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	150.71842016345926
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	173.5120124649249
Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	156.78271591631122
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"
	191.78055817647348
"Oh, lord! I don't know.	585.2789493501638
Not these two or three years perhaps."
	226.58000205551016
"As often as I can.	191.03018930208717
But you know married women have never much time for
writing.	169.65354742051565
My sisters may write to _me_.	172.00286754225877
They will have nothing else to
do."
	95.96180294645096
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	179.13476720667646
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	253.9387128438431
Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw.	113.87620534034802
I am prodigiously proud of him.	163.14807570498877
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."
	419.2231482053087
The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	179.60128564327403
Bennet very dull for several days.	246.26941857435583
"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth.	176.04940631982615
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."
	185.8452870567032
"It is no such thing.	87.36739973387915
If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
	106.00096963561349
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	195.28900122667636
The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	184.8172040035798
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	100.5895705887057
"Well, well, and so Mr.	124.22768657611938
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.	148.82570334896374
Not that
I care about it, though.	179.21652035605547
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again.	153.31467808285333
But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	138.21889597519612
And who knows what _may_ happen?	369.00328621799883
But that is nothing to us.	69.0319713077935
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
	111.78177895961319
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.	144.74165205036635
Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	148.49158203625953
He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	287.71746158412566
She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."
	209.26848912252527
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	179.44703874776673
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,
	149.15037286481447
"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed.	224.1061928562305
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	263.01108794489204
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at.	245.0488211975874
I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	172.95568633656646
I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	139.1351538881498
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."
	336.7535407960899
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	64.58492316819128
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."
	242.019954121771
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	144.11080771694182
They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	193.88373510027307
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	264.52931601459807
"As soon as ever Mr.	176.854930506476
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."
	100.69423297081936
"No, no.	45.31040584449378
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	198.41796048542818
But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."
	190.45408543697204
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.	201.05452408210604
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.	364.5904943805506
"If he wants our society, let
him seek it.	223.30847363057404
He knows where we live.	287.5509531885366
I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."
	225.7690691948099
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	156.6392622975117
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined.	315.4550360524951
We must have Mrs.	159.36545187422905
Long and the Gouldings soon.	94.83958323396897
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr.	152.6771681930714
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	125.96566655157497
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	236.0064943678461
My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says.	182.15125373763087
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
	208.0772716321074
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	177.44414535549691
You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."
	172.94647723585837
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	227.13589289762155
But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	198.9075308151518
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	195.15545181784535
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.	186.6600760747528
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	97.21150298859781
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"
	144.68417278452776
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know."
	264.26705230430736
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	159.0631358299817
what's his name.	89.64225894721798
That tall, proud man."
	310.5512018195464
"Good gracious! Mr.	472.99820956251966
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.	218.4584727889275
Well, any friend of
Mr.	144.5132108763484
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."
	181.4180018530287
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	194.63934369759914
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.	112.83950688076717
Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr.	104.70556638390744
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	131.84824286115764
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	214.7182170730554
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	150.2699079861246
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley.	178.9588702471328
Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.	203.90791561126227
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	184.633444718572
But she would not be secure.	84.26805478772211
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."
	163.94344754401584
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	200.24848859391847
Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	278.9363835766678
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	249.60789490058727
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	149.2616226241963
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	275.6013887427452
He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley.	139.67592888693258
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	96.72435517469351
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	162.7335618859523
He was received by Mrs.	159.77324772814845
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	180.50295428321286
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	210.02639993611757
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr.	177.901119924783
Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	155.831129031897
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	96.28422418266493
There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	77.75233847847949
But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	196.608869981066
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	262.8998920175972
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	123.17689085190992
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.	137.40316865516726
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	105.49614059733712
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	133.51684582495113
"It is a long time, Mr.	149.0782041576076
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.	217.67337772564196
He readily agreed to it.	130.65195699509025
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	139.88361407255525
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true.	220.09399017502716
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	179.21313951757634
And one of my
own daughters.	95.19271218271695
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	108.2360427099162
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	107.64318199812344
It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq.	446.9133283202482
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	203.34976039594744
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	183.81801093194764
Did you see it?"
	60.110801568464126
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	107.47639096951579
How Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	117.42123245951113
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr.	122.7380048542738
Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	100.1298722580764
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long.	188.89310630709457
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	147.31254326664413
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."
	217.17766970992577
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.	179.1995384639982
Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	138.12132024291765
It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	172.55596644525636
A few weeks, he believed.	192.80704287791247
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.	250.98170972647972
Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.	204.73938128344201
Bennet's manor.	183.81900873209128
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."
	133.8162773260517
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	254.2957296313376
At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	210.420592479669
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	98.4645831741189
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"
	219.8053568940078
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	214.75694977864794
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	114.13813418406059
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	159.60254893611872
Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	120.8395253372888
But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	128.02632118551108
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	196.06269106525752
Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.	161.96203698505803
Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	137.8812170657216
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."
	181.23187225043134
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	168.5359868660355
They then went away.	150.5324522281408
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	172.0160914594867
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	229.8691252984465
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	153.18094054422616
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"
	126.6646287535291
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	127.60617316145434
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	112.50828161415141
If he fears me, why come hither?	270.9131861904714
If
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	202.39254023902961
Teazing, teazing, man! I will
think no more about him."
	225.78862277674773
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	201.3292307865226
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy.	229.5429737778522
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	282.4642624682962
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.	407.9037941931528
"Oh, Jane,
take care."
	336.2373780709819
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."
	155.11873739765363
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."
	106.76250038365346
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.	187.4745854394237
Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	178.68478041103822
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	191.9887711085728
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	195.7221540874857
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	191.9087088425914
He placed himself by her.	130.66697099257598
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	212.82688951489624
He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr.	206.03642682152503
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	201.40359024492156
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	213.09748415750906
Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	192.45780757074098
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	139.64189034964625
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	123.83115773433414
He was on one side of her mother.	75.81245719358351
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	181.55202528339404
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	153.98959615474757
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	198.01768899102967
Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	167.2553770719134
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	133.3271306388636
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."
	162.74307281132516
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	224.43604887431377
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,
	129.53223186014307
"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	387.5691516025027
We want none of them;
do we?"
	140.02363380298246
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	103.77012208151608
She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!
	208.04686184651706
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"
	181.58078668048705
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,
	204.04156265938533
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
	188.13427597722648
"And quite alone?	169.88841271319575
Have all her friends left her?"
	91.91076461007339
Annesley is with her.	43.84840168262781
The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."
	213.1617683284599
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	119.11914000302203
He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	162.47270372295316
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	193.86035863807552
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	174.38539088332365
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	133.02405807763617
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day?	117.35924512069273
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you.	275.81255301941246
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	206.95927216863376
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas's last week; and even Mr.	245.9397957404228
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least.	289.5626557227345
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty.	266.0507631973623
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	146.67020758948198
And
what do you think she said besides?	113.9511053206157
'Ah! Mrs.	227.5647962113789
Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.	190.72435847489717
I do think Mrs.	199.69879494773997
Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
	201.4845041442665
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	137.9752504986343
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	228.89801592871572
"The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	192.5916606880749
I hope we
may often meet again."
	199.93016196756568
Elizabeth smiled.	143.6423116441048
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	68.9291430203411
You must not suspect me.	132.82056685277433
It mortifies me.	269.5909343474573
I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	187.00536024787527
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	158.7506614213938
It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."
	187.20167898546921
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."
	139.21969938211836
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
	130.60644999836694
"And how impossible in others!"
	138.09022060299498
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"
	256.03989403837204
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	171.20965056732584
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	210.88968699404631
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."
	178.60494095228006
CHAPTER XIII.	227.5647962113789
A few days after this visit, Mr.	291.3705347721528
Bingley called again, and alone.	142.74682258743178
His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time.	160.09007034588038
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	164.863225066805
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	213.48217895252245
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."
	197.97447029689798
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	172.55702384166807
&c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	146.01737085102818
"Can you come to-morrow?"
	90.65958596459825
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	121.3741927497992
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	119.04910223126394
In ran Mrs.	422.8068598414599
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,
	182.6342899684254
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	295.5861058123743
Make haste, make haste.	301.07019143858605
Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	209.33132722923926
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."
	534.0754264060713
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."
	237.64658609450802
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	150.9398836726791
Come be quick, be quick!
where is your sash my dear?"
	203.12224255669568
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	127.64066064713413
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	151.53628064753693
After tea, Mr.	422.8068598414599
Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	175.46051412038918
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs.	305.9751479159357
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	254.12943957308747
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?	191.42988484892078
What do
you keep winking at me for?	150.00403789974538
What am I to do?"
	122.7783653378169
"Nothing child, nothing.	183.09164445856683
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,
	289.6724768808975
"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	126.55259319097165
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	197.44731564917723
In a few minutes, Mrs.	192.36759193196056
Bennet half opened the door and called out,
	161.6119845056403
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
	135.5034918060814
Elizabeth was forced to go.	84.68918669875887
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	101.89163881109597
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	170.57660831354738
Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	145.44717078653179
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	190.51441781180856
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	144.12738543963002
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.	145.59594767561444
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.	272.269344468309
Darcy
returned within the stated time.	221.96742147107145
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	184.99040942414157
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.	132.59852269969073
Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	139.86478388940336
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	192.4429961349935
There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	201.55364444131172
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs.	106.18246104336305
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	136.39077412939326
Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	151.64765493885935
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	137.35041582791683
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	199.9282330523578
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	279.78898426215164
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	167.55752218380448
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	198.29175099338835
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.	141.34067010918915
I do not deserve it.	100.50257610125148
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	229.80041074267209
But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	103.99896821507099
He is gone to my father already.	116.30392498506009
Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"
	187.3443765030812
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	220.9088705276598
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	198.61500041722618
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
	172.55774553010903
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	142.95676643980931
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	123.82725932514118
"With my mother up stairs.	151.18377446437634
She will be down in a moment I dare say."
	163.05261843355294
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	130.07944889278735
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	182.24217010407452
They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	185.73759881575702
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	195.5458640585708
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	198.42485598412094
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr.	187.0216134886965
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	219.1557658981901
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,
	130.97994474585974
"Jane, I congratulate you.	284.5303178290468
You will be a very happy woman."
	101.20510546056819
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	166.6895086750044
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	166.32062424412476
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	116.14803452519826
You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."
	183.71578381513157
"I hope not so.	74.18809691483814
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."
	255.22049278606164
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr.	428.34495265657387
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	110.7973008652352
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	371.67532643263155
I knew how it
would be.	90.79030347444011
I always said it must be so, at last.	95.84957652495756
I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	203.59071233655317
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	234.6725098724274
Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	245.0839074390442
At that moment, she cared for no other.	120.69247189664405
Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	163.82841062297925
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	234.70166709728687
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	245.49706460366406
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	173.05371091035673
In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	195.4874345878123
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
believed it possible."
	179.90548535033506
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.	257.8799600080974
"But how did he account for
it?"
	97.40714190830886
"It must have been his sister's doing.	106.24045189945555
They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	202.2557245628227
But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."
	158.0611903236919
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter.	282.9612147123975
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."
	313.42632488022093
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"
	190.80294955270435
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	237.1830443188616
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	133.99618778781192
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane.	290.5053270691497
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"
	323.11877995969985
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you.	151.09846775498474
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness.	269.27637327900845
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr.	293.5741096337852
Collins in time."
	55.12280289361782
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	151.60880078455554
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	157.96167281150707
Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.	163.68597465522367
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	214.24736298650961
CHAPTER XIV.	227.5647962113789
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	175.78737967538976
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	123.59165566842985
The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	190.7354184260136
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	229.095417129056
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	207.2896621173083
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.	139.70910827983724
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	195.45634806201767
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	212.87774800187688
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	140.2490914258486
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	250.4229568275513
That lady I suppose is your mother."
	208.15144531125054
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	112.63127167060146
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."
	190.19097548308437
"Yes, madam," said Mrs.	294.42725852267847
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	135.43353083432268
"She is my youngest girl but one.	139.56434459800394
My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."
	190.21392402076808
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.	289.98820897439157
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
	287.4370106941453
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."
	196.54236951075075
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,
	150.70395006341195
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.	278.49061525413344
Collins well."
	59.6763808341638
"Yes, very well.	73.15330475603785
I saw them the night before last."
	133.3029513552375
But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	178.60620673690207
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	183.0096690327566
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."
	125.92059701538462
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	159.24952143719682
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."
	118.85172985581356
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	280.3418697901797
As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	287.63564686483545
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	146.08436753079332
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	218.56336493853033
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
her face.	134.61642013013085
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--
	216.80149064937612
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	212.82439761543836
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."
	286.0898368925709
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	243.74465355040053
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	189.49200572745613
I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."
	99.8647174499725
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with.	173.78608367600663
But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	202.8544542153948
My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	195.9242457930352
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	275.316984340617
I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.	202.5191348012449
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."
	237.39605532508193
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	220.98080621627787
What could your ladyship propose by it?"
	150.68465172797397
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
	317.5151801311541
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."
	172.06218182960242
"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	101.6775605161425
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	260.80293129578905
Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"
	151.8586789241519
"I never heard that it was."
	72.36079199670375
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"
	159.80755930483056
_You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."
	251.49026852312235
"This is not to be borne.	75.89508741648424
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	474.99714884726865
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
	133.4587887003116
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
	132.84180026032743
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	112.1444839148724
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	163.1786525809802
You
may have drawn him in."
	112.0780869255212
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
	175.1281880105543
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	219.35284032689313
I have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	128.809491477296
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
	158.08768196533043
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."
	180.91376688041967
"Let me be rightly understood.	223.13210619983155
This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	161.3813119871094
No, never.	60.41379123147382
Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	261.2998754701974
Now what have you to say?"
	60.14524589816893
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."
	103.11595717090977
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,
	191.33133586868198
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	165.23822641401756
From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other.	177.33573550367396
While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	156.96771915179846
Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	144.9208915399161
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"
	143.33996183031977
"Yes, and I had heard it before.	119.48077145841631
But what is that to me?	54.27870868628203
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh.	210.772235197693
You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	117.12199219255763
Its completion depended on others.	453.00590419326585
If Mr.	227.5647962113789
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	184.8207711010413
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
	267.0995045079716
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	573.1611602364911
Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	215.68669235009233
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.	483.0086307718655
"But the wife of Mr.	115.85128354351167
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."
	172.22051062478926
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	253.3250359261347
Is nothing due to me on that
score?	146.7290314489453
"Let us sit down.	225.6238353357569
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it.	280.51626325456147
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	151.68276921118016
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."
	125.19728732126585
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."
	182.84087769396504
"I will not be interrupted.	100.8128429470268
Hear me in silence.	88.12495448721269
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	261.55561500214475
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	272.0580282460472
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	184.80259527961482
The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	285.4440947794799
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	116.25142647511784
If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."
	121.76496692353103
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	307.72985637960943
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."
	181.259166861893
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	204.37655796601348
But who was your mother?	85.22591975595546
Who
are your uncles and aunts?	211.60252970797688
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
	160.25714451019937
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"
	98.54093687450656
"I am not."
	53.2921029903612
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	355.2603121957855
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"
	165.80771631530038
"I will make no promise of the kind."
	107.92820526359846
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	397.6287661918594
I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	165.77441733768254
I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require."
	216.4378027834194
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	216.86008677129362
Your ladyship wants Mr.	474.4200773662137
Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	177.8940065025403
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	201.51508144536803
You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	240.2477216494605
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."
	156.27545515139917
I have by no means done.	109.0878687971653
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	291.4461297648238
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	183.083462465127
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	134.0068613079912
And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	126.64349335662128
Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	140.69088805704015
Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	124.28086897062875
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"
	204.34462823960988
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	217.10649937774983
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	220.98733497575375
I must beg to return to
the house."
	92.72106117885612
And she rose as she spoke.	115.41299891971966
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	306.9747950630325
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	251.72664087845516
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"
	174.69234107684272
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	234.3429461995923
You know my sentiments."
	144.8479144348525
"I have said no such thing.	94.48201059414343
I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
	188.51086596841697
"It is well.	65.1222627833045
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	181.18150407782758
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	224.28149659959112
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
	99.55049608367001
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	286.91273283422026
No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr.	219.15790788918707
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."
	135.51335841500017
I
shall now know how to act.	141.84159791056612
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	290.37983685311764
I came to try you.	102.73980057847264
I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."
	242.67786981488285
"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	220.67778788163614
I send no compliments to your
mother.	153.83725905965144
You deserve no such attention.	187.33155107698562
I am most seriously displeased."
	286.40331342522774
She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	214.59259325768798
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	183.99261086172012
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."
	113.54934161307179
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	203.56285617107218
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	225.30272570422213
I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
	124.48872952015208
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	148.43292298968333
CHAPTER XV.	227.5647962113789
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	240.2986511461532
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	135.36207425686928
And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	248.55450762014
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	217.6899006572764
From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	167.87588197811394
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	166.37145693748414
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	277.3786531483971
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	168.9639168632906
In that case he would return no more.	118.57022580500406
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	187.3129186964998
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it.	184.64241974293202
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	207.56111461634563
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."
	209.9721968380394
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	159.70720848702354
Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	176.29402513286175
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	130.89303117141256
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."
	137.00114734010515
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	136.10489907736797
It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	216.89700854762745
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	144.10197637208432
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	165.4611158175363
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	233.023959224386
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	191.66641354094634
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."
	192.82287683711596
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,
	178.75342048225428
"You look conscious.	307.9848689686984
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	306.4778722292018
This letter is from Mr.	171.26686511060439
"From Mr.	227.5647962113789
Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"
	94.28408849406851
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	176.8366722906943
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	263.25332955567717
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	166.33583458826737
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."
	214.6498896681129
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	349.9414573280336
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."
	220.41832759931205
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	184.7658695284644
We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."
	213.0772988785072
Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you.	342.6928754205802
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	212.44332473819253
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"
	200.32901117085748
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	226.10210338519136
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	123.40757771375489
"Are you not diverted?"
	110.44062293763209
"Oh! yes.	87.18848383669449
Pray read on."
	99.44450245195667
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.	175.12225875885957
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	203.93809218533826
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it.	234.8688435875971
But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	143.2178926674655
For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"
	179.64804141911128
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	615.4254310200877
But it is so
strange!"
	97.2269350322709
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	218.08365679403198
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr.	329.17450798184245
Collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	179.10412152827567
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	260.4956773859425
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report?	433.83397287670056
Did she call to refuse her consent?"
	143.87200697377665
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	137.27533008116956
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	107.43890583257208
It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	130.47675254129553
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr.	172.95206574861442
CHAPTER XVI.	227.5647962113789
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	296.9969570922239
Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out.	201.13403854674655
It was agreed to.	71.66841715572343
Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	193.58647831548925
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	185.12316184064773
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	196.35266240021966
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	276.26099276689087
Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,
	126.39116235109216
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	195.1822677759646
I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	213.70557597558124
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	242.35562527206565
Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
	135.68999577314491
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	193.30791297136912
I did not think Mrs.	154.93553042601056
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."
	85.56098764951452
"You must not blame my aunt.	131.49007171904665
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars.	172.3022454302026
Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."
	159.35826972300248
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	176.2450374630254
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	184.48741408189272
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_."
	328.2583752554379
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	117.60196234347876
After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.	233.1418228779783
If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	184.26407537178144
_My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."
	187.47010443523422
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	179.902216417922
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	155.09966171922238
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	184.25223891586907
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	101.81242564002895
She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	208.0679504763428
But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	259.1499321949204
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	179.7223851894406
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
	219.91672194749933
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	186.2744867169664
After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."
	208.95848547796305
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	137.58476076764362
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	265.30437770901676
It was
unpardonable.	130.94148493735034
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."
	133.45093704795212
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth.	204.85072900541456
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."
	314.8506719632768
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	167.1397927446804
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	174.76441675439096
Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.	279.51952404008176
You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
	239.2646480492442
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	188.49499335268135
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."
	107.93729024289505
"I can easily believe it.	139.70387682066018
You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did.	240.05115317526457
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."
	175.19269689449325
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	202.77851036057106
These recollections will not do at
all.	114.92016881933434
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
	175.33561458558225
Darcy mentioned his letter.	127.72152064770943
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	117.27928178116854
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"
	159.82356256749702
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	182.87432220997837
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	163.1494342224219
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	124.4629864750429
I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."
	272.38272494029223
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."
	220.10044347216913
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."
	331.9528096173009
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	160.22059920445767
The
adieu is charity itself.	468.77871018909497
But think no more of the letter.	72.41830464043451
You must learn some
of my philosophy.	172.91513442582269
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."
	176.64236180365094
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	138.7820102089055
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	205.51740937464388
But with _me_, it is not so.	80.36706865543997
Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	210.56622632680006
I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	158.20020934380503
As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.	254.54414413070984
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	182.5532056271008
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	219.50358449912912
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	311.54033121487623
By you, I was properly humbled.	290.4964847665174
I came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	107.3678150749541
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."
	225.13766447595404
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"
	206.86170056228826
"Indeed I had.	149.45386866920214
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	207.6911905735933
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	226.89785932351808
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"
	176.76072160643213
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."
	205.04447933841263
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley.	176.86065266515058
You blamed me for coming?"
	230.1950587272979
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."
	257.68831878417535
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	172.25340691501853
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."
	347.5080692842279
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	214.27296192537008
How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."
	296.4617613442877
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	181.57139918313905
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	148.80332251193417
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	176.31897109301002
"What could become of Mr.	195.61758721370293
Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	215.91132725706606
Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	130.1384588080901
"Not at all.	50.93466213872721
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
	268.6879670673529
"That is to say, you had given your permission.	105.68527982822663
I guessed as much." And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	175.29070016553985
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	213.82895844917374
His surprise was great.	112.1966607605933
He had never had the
slightest suspicion.	140.0061022224934
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."
	211.48264504225017
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	170.92335262242946
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
	176.61568484550227
"From the former.	60.653328549615985
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."
	209.31779669490584
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."
	241.52438512330184
"It did.	56.51543976820403
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	311.54023797227615
I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	141.34187145136093
I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	171.48320879542277
He was
angry.	95.42948170516816
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	229.77325197062305
He has heartily forgiven me
now."
	287.1796082272212
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.	232.42433985169464
Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	195.0045272548171
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	135.47308263201901
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	137.22361375375968
In the hall they parted.	127.59454802283499
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	154.69137139206862
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	133.46123001585826
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	182.17210604226057
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	325.8699949493371
The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	317.2039638109472
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	201.29058185480758
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	152.53511924702877
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	333.6276224283842
"You are joking, Lizzy.	435.21893957056477
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.	161.09294896783803
Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me.	181.3776838478061
I know it to be impossible."
	70.50105718974245
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	229.99673180556988
Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest.	225.60806638322305
He still loves me, and we are
engaged."
	188.89066097917322
Jane looked at her doubtingly.	156.37335710252006
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	137.45296319951532
I know how much
you dislike him."
	121.96676857903049
"You know nothing of the matter.	79.76084129895021
_That_ is all to be forgot.	82.36906869837298
But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	186.8713768743923
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."
	181.6214501054108
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	328.03473049683095
Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	148.20504772259542
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane.	290.5331223192142
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	278.16559927438476
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"
	107.40232368825072
"There can be no doubt of that.	80.2897192146459
It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	133.31044084782354
But are you pleased,
Jane?	192.69863079825365
Shall you like to have such a brother?"
	79.5521671759762
"Very, very much.	67.68887581181316
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight.	261.44049397292747
And do you
really love him quite well enough?	149.39654801248406
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	252.9305403352597
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"
	108.60322546465613
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."
	332.3841215947364
"What do you mean?"
	92.34600080441477
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	377.20534411331835
I am
afraid you will be angry."
	127.15776248154151
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	290.54133472835093
I want to talk very seriously.	168.55255879544305
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	172.52668092691096
Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"
	131.45616292435497
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	204.02423399404992
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."
	352.45558386261257
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	230.32992582861758
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	262.86672240678166
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	135.31710432053043
I
always had a value for him.	102.83217901142932
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	151.702441765776
How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you."
	160.35894460780483
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	152.19449531190196
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	168.1566422880671
All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	140.69617880362958
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs.	445.1711711935433
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr.	166.59555597914948
Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	209.0996116529656
What shall we do with him?	92.65836714210474
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way."
	118.82947251798049
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	223.8286950480942
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"
	201.42452728177426
"I advise Mr.	472.99820956251966
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.	243.79994412110238
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning.	195.4964172598637
It is a nice long walk, and Mr.	185.1421262117525
Darcy has
never seen the view."
	137.0112602897966
Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty.	162.96489080568654
Wont it, Kitty?"
	140.10679791128334
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	165.10057946410285
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented.	265.30252664282796
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	230.05900462269
Bennet followed her,
saying,
	147.80452026244004
So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."
	160.0246857948256
Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	101.20847057528064
Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	109.96094727165968
She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	173.70046565291116
But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.	170.11936811518504
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	153.76482872666685
In the evening, soon after Mr.	157.91094133855657
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr.	171.09972198824318
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	190.79748400503962
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.	175.21734405490812
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	145.544117514936
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	183.70020920231568
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	180.64056380394123
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	101.50548382298513
Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	129.58038538300477
Have not you always hated him?"
	123.05412271064576
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr.	194.3237655204261
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	98.9751565605677
But will they make you happy?"
	104.67531165730234
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"
	195.70207306963744
"None at all.	50.93466213872721
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."
	129.84030095696482
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	192.46401357329512
Indeed he has no improper pride.	176.90523572300373
He is perfectly amiable.	148.35328958693665
You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."
	131.04269128290312
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.	172.58813546040562
He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	177.35270445609768
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	124.86866866944675
But let me advise you to think better of it.	105.93397917528334
I know your
disposition, Lizzy.	252.22629139753926
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	201.1645562705285
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	221.94651869196952
You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	291.3080946997192
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	197.8242146661433
You know not what you are
about."
	88.54890593356347
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.	209.31752276378407
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	186.6427906353466
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say.	145.49489248864
If this be the case, he deserves you.	99.50538146684724
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.	257.5257363352329
Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia.	237.52295705912942
He heard her with astonishment.	105.70344895425806
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better.	235.4403071884032
It will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	175.29930034555727
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	255.43834171515113
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."
	138.24138951183735
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr.	236.45794925441174
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."
	206.23106543307725
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	187.4142990680234
Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	217.1818382432227
Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	210.22194362025328
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	121.03506064682381
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	249.71961223782233
Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true?	206.02645921641417
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	232.1452207711712
Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	280.368837180504
I
hope he will overlook it.	133.05705927584526
Dear, dear Lizzy.	237.42144067154763
I shall go distracted."
	260.51526042747327
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	204.00961307648265
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	112.61270149665062
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence.	299.95477141685905
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	159.66678200651123
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.	299.0746673020544
Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."
	142.9380666353362
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	149.91264194799004
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	200.20523481662158
Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	162.05432955237123
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr.	155.14587041005643
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	143.16046028418378
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	217.55372488739292
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."
	276.4214127941054
CHAPTER XVIII.	227.5647962113789
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.	279.94130757150685
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	120.99606221139096
"How could
you begin?" said she.	99.06278870539754
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"
	169.69085997314454
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	165.08666505149625
It is too long ago.	151.75393578927796
I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."
	318.858554891121
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	175.41567972602533
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"
	171.9682577674283
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."
	178.13602933726176
"You may as well call it impertinence at once.	166.84818416908163
It was very little less.	95.29553175970749
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	178.50196528441796
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	317.8423828640552
Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	183.55350559497472
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	225.83169896181602
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."
	178.66375679699297
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?"
	181.0549617690482
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	144.71946444211585
But make a virtue of it
by all means.	106.39248538994904
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	167.05402124637865
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	181.12827217716406
Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"
	145.0988277208701
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."
	155.31378588382503
"But I was embarrassed."
	263.5180969004246
"And so was I."
	125.85954941798812
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."
	112.67757409272562
"A man who had felt less, might."
	146.64141403973187
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	176.84599422858201
I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	248.72978110827046
_Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	250.19499477738987
This will never do."
	90.24812084144193
"You need not distress yourself.	229.7004881029045
The moral will be perfectly fair.	255.67012246904096
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	197.74857639136528
My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."
	166.3035775263459
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	157.11390958062054
But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for?	149.95998682212715
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"
	172.28986692833624
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me.	191.7036179588972
My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."
	181.95460063762832
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her?"
	186.8655061191054
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	240.2779318760448
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."
	125.25850720351589
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	191.01012473470678
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."
	215.24909365454187
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.	223.2670352796109
Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	316.41041982336884
"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
	152.1799649797041
done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
	221.3325729400726
to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	187.93121811235073
You supposed more than
	138.37472906323728
really existed.	216.63048118484667
flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
	131.57965594521045
You must write again very
	136.8098626057441
soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	112.88494427859472
thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	93.81958440945753
How could I
	180.05713238882123
be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	166.68312774399928
We will go round the Park every day.	200.93751268580107
I am the happiest creature in
	122.94802569079961
the world.	68.15690551706716
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
	109.2347609917841
with such justice.	139.62941706762518
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
	386.8889485039596
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
	100.1282898411089
spare from me.	63.333298821022986
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	149.54037976996625
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr.	201.49002588547813
Bennet sent to Mr.	194.47754849468163
Collins, in
reply to his last.	80.06587615950271
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	180.84984648409565
soon be the wife of Mr.	103.770298206986
Console Lady Catherine as well as
	215.6736141235082
you can.	56.80140558686938
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	219.40067307122354
He has
	59.67471374274467
more to give.	46.95318733127705
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	169.2425678441418
She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	181.76981749260142
Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	159.79927511361015
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	274.88353668873793
Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	174.41713644776434
Before any answer could arrive from Mr.	276.1115888980966
Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	232.05522120299037
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	210.96082313054342
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	168.31069193144845
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	290.8109793850598
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St.	266.4831775561931
James's, with very decent composure.	184.9916766250811
If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	210.8044519310708
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs.	212.3540119076405
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	198.25846254066482
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	124.84315768246174
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.	144.2945142136852
CHAPTER XIX.	227.5647962113789
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.	135.85686894232305
Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	250.673024067392
Bingley and talked of Mrs.	120.85736574929695
Darcy may be guessed.	156.15388586577225
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	177.00871667828665
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	226.16770961583248
He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	194.93569970377644
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	250.89633984181137
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	249.89746972578507
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	141.29812791597698
In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	156.73802683730028
She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	252.03727785194238
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.	174.8511200777613
Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	203.97863896321633
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	166.1530166907141
He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	183.68095044964556
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	186.58562716577038
The letter was to this
effect:
	94.25619217574204
"MY DEAR LIZZY,
	532.9036398671572
"I wish you joy.	144.96608575680523
If you love Mr.	181.68069344450714
It is a great comfort to have you
	74.69778412727744
so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
	136.91705338736983
think of us.	51.55802694650655
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
	207.48931517768938
much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
	166.87728459638788
upon without some help.	151.71124969468352
Any place would do, of about three or four
	151.43939985096043
hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr.	135.40195623825096
Darcy about it,
	64.43527371409144
if you had rather not.	69.56963333918911
"Yours, &c."
	146.4243853288062
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	172.3460554298247
It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	226.64234329939083
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	200.00321533386338
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	186.1831199280992
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	149.04330079962477
Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	177.48705434327948
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	202.86879093331922
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	184.42318614405082
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	195.67543430117016
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	182.072979111447
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	169.9667449237287
Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	195.77477301407367

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.	479.4450000984776
Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.	515.0931521678211
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.	373.3015161782858
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	270.55662433255577
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.	313.26189223929316
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.	448.87639457164397
