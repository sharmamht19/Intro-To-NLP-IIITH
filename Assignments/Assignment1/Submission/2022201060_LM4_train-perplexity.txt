by James Joyce
	494.0867752080217
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	323.24931813838316
A yellow
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air.	426.4759787996505
He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
	319.9676681876368
—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.	754.9716355919994
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
	278.8859072690836
—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
	481.6606915965299
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	200.28842602129737
He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains.	357.2569453246792
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head.	308.02493940544906
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.	336.8985955532672
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.	178.17180834247603
He added in a preacher’s tone:
	197.1515008344049
—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns.	397.2688476889729
Slow music, please.	222.5520388010055
Shut your eyes, gents.	239.26367089094407
One
moment.	98.02999451877047
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	361.35807336455224
Silence, all.	38.29937396393764
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points.	347.665016987051
Two strong shrill whistles
answered through the calm.	488.2122968248281
That will do nicely.	220.35625274511318
Switch off
the current, will you?	125.57142380806975
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	308.09510105563345
The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	578.302768904389
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	368.4574068098329
—The mockery of it! he said gaily.	135.40284863004513
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
	471.1031222566737
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.	219.09734567158714
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.	279.8726628899634
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.	249.54224207785617
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	569.3036992292209
But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?	225.02059521427475
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	144.8528126484383
We
must go to Athens.	182.45953365154566
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?	276.73469074021693
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
	264.99743575575985
—Will he come?	59.21930476359614
The jejune jesuit!
	871.6528860543791
Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	168.9163198989726
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	353.91435190223746
—Yes, my love?	95.26132990505509
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	234.45294329235685
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	383.5971256159889
—God, isn’t he dreadful?	210.17377345474029
he said frankly.	161.99174434528058
A ponderous Saxon.	622.6483298082671
He thinks
you’re not a gentleman.	148.9732473602224
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
and indigestion.	413.07684785049145
Because he comes from Oxford.	177.49949081323535
You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner.	289.7497668481104
He can’t make you out.	119.50587222093651
O, my name for you
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.	172.00666485065855
He shaved warily over his chin.	438.6295311325815
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	265.39196009638624
Where is
his guncase?	148.38326343978682
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	714.4238486660483
Were you in a funk?	95.57379741219142
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	279.4434545995994
Out here in the dark
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther.	220.3995980765175
You saved men from drowning.	323.95068778671
I’m not a hero, however.	181.23997950461376
If
he stays on here I am off.	245.36953838122167
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	295.0278680784853
He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	400.4230731726012
—Scutter! he cried thickly.	206.68402562887874
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
pocket, said:
	223.7118073060817
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	290.0989143057266
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief.	265.11095973308085
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	558.4423936605955
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
	147.74975385363197
—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	775.9634845157034
You can almost taste it, can’t you?	197.9681970514941
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.	434.7303549220742
—God! he said quietly.	90.42532422013299
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother?	195.39978872328354
The snotgreen sea.	394.7672530393076
The scrotumtightening sea.	508.83800023302604
_Epi oinopa
ponton_.	973.2501590319478
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	392.1994956197486
You must read them
in the original.	122.5948403974593
_Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.	323.7450807442361
Come and look.	55.905449588031395
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	120.21927054888828
Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown.	150.9798599708188
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	509.6889186602081
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face.	245.01472426189952
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	233.28609554497686
That’s why she won’t
let me have anything to do with you.	138.4424157897306
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	416.13037713515376
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	368.94488291468804
I’m hyperborean as much as you.	203.06584891311797
But to
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
pray for her.	166.85443551978656
And you refused.	183.28528424797508
There is something sinister in you....	137.93988759523367
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	381.3294752170841
A tolerant
smile curled his lips.	531.1972264254808
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	192.24641558514602
Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!
	170.71179843578034
He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	365.09132812164984
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.	402.0553568933287
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	161.37530025483267
Silently,
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes.	346.44629743605
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	267.72118435745034
The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	319.7785083340108
A bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	504.8123436448557
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	457.11844889479534
—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	143.5763160256867
I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags.	172.3852817925407
How are the secondhand breeks?	262.6311156531688
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	515.1282060923158
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	556.7147864176819
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	158.7326414745819
Secondleg they should be.	112.61015432109487
God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	424.32395104514006
I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey.	225.24258983648016
You’ll look spiffing in them.	204.40768645987183
I’m not joking, Kinch.	367.96889549697516
You
look damn well when you’re dressed.	251.48426106906857
—Thanks, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
I can’t wear them if they are grey.	198.6577549212488
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	232.85283570133515
Etiquette is etiquette.	181.8771420526239
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers.	266.4585327728071
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.	390.51517600185576
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.	197.1493179646438
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g.	260.96933054171626
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	232.7563521052735
General paralysis of the insane!
	206.5123178856977
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	225.91722578664806
His curling shaven lips
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	359.3084858552547
Laughter seized
all his strong wellknit trunk.	535.1205607077891
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
	212.09483978530486
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack.	246.2250027233569
As he and others see me.	89.2666308328721
Who chose this
face for me?	188.8187977090601
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	329.85085473855054
It asks me too.	212.8680967751369
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.	277.6789280043584
It does her
all right.	118.08789353258571
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	762.5385126043249
Lead him not into temptation.	198.99275672119074
And her name is Ursula.	164.73091542946676
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.	224.55606551696667
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	165.2096253580933
If
Wilde were only alive to see you!
	203.7989601867159
—It is a symbol of Irish art.	199.39246477014638
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	253.97462078974945
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them.	231.2379581760795
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	157.03984583019746
he said kindly.	143.56989828629173
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	179.47473937723495
Parried again.	69.07159083352626
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	210.09901276799295
The
cold steel pen.	460.703154604909
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	238.1311903547308
He’s stinking with money and
thinks you’re not a gentleman.	171.76403029453166
His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	364.95572276723465
God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might do something for the island.	247.72898260751944
Hellenise it.	30.60773084408939
Cranly’s arm.	92.22241047819378
His arm.	116.59113108081569
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	200.75245397529693
I’m the only one
that knows what you are.	111.40840321836957
Why don’t you trust me more?	175.33160178195214
What have you up
your nose against me?	151.756576343215
Is it Haines?	140.3907322034375
If he makes any noise here I’ll
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
Clive Kempthorpe.	405.6989421819631
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.	462.85802430373036
Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	340.53303417655235
O, I shall
expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears.	442.3316282567084
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.	536.3850086245161
I don’t
want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!
	262.4893720905595
Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	226.96132046620667
A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	720.4937583552969
new paganism...	299.35884665341155
—Let him stay, Stephen said.	249.05753699146524
There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night.	179.71791088510335
—Then what is it?	57.78703597408876
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	519.6626608861229
Cough it up.	50.63765173449159
I’m
quite frank with you.	187.43717524388495
What have you against me now?	117.39487675910577
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	286.2889360623063
Stephen freed his arm
quietly.	337.3579686158713
—Do you wish me to tell you?	110.66564200961533
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—Yes, what is it?	57.78703597408876
Buck Mulligan answered.	325.6971366631216
I don’t remember anything.	203.32774741380052
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.	167.3745193789427
A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes.	376.5415126763608
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
	213.2646283282235
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
death?	191.05995379992856
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
	277.2071575168867
I can’t remember anything.	199.82493496757232
I remember only ideas and
sensations.	320.8266529602361
What happened in the name of God?	127.23146378843731
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
more hot water.	266.19288060244213
Your mother and some visitor came out of the
drawingroom.	176.2396431973647
She asked you who was in your room.	122.23854938630063
Buck Mulligan said.	165.5081573229974
What did I say?	236.77752711284433
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead._
	356.6142779660662
A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
Mulligan’s cheek.	453.91329237791336
—Did I say that?	169.09684710326502
he asked.	66.98244490415372
What harm is that?	113.7197665864506
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?	172.3531941196391
You saw
only your mother die.	248.71948270216106
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	237.1494231372681
It’s a beastly
thing and nothing else.	172.77174655961977
It simply doesn’t matter.	300.08201415861066
You wouldn’t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	218.45242261359397
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected
the wrong way.	203.8606401010096
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.	125.097919893125
Her cerebral lobes
are not functioning.	706.5638090339665
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt.	432.8371242682349
Humour her till it’s over.	90.05734737016635
You crossed her
last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
some hired mute from Lalouette’s.	360.2689348699437
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	320.5168031980818
I
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	190.89856393612854
He had spoken himself into boldness.	358.632849614962
Stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
	268.93456963216056
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	140.4235406285399
—Of what then?	69.77233079498723
Buck Mulligan asked.	255.87999104604643
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	191.09421592323855
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	323.05678218654197
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	323.97544638666596
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	227.99750690815128
Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	283.233105052893
Sea and headland now
grew dim.	403.9544327544541
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks.	193.02466939559983
A voice within the tower called loudly:
	281.61241626909845
—Are you up there, Mulligan?	146.43300646681982
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	502.2284972911078
He turned towards Stephen and said:
	185.1290361502609
—Look at the sea.	59.971305387106455
What does it care about offences?	300.66641326409604
Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down.	212.89901221014327
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	441.16702814960115
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:
	162.37063180586446
—Don’t mope over it all day, he said.	152.54332426858775
I’m inconsequent.	306.7521064276188
Give up the
moody brooding.	243.60748596890988
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:
	245.70421742973363
And no more turn aside and brood
	232.761205857312
Upon love’s bitter mystery
	272.2184537791136
For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	589.4708915764174
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed.	318.5800144893228
Inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	369.5859991963234
White breast of the
dim sea.	165.96826378840657
The twining stresses, two by two.	397.3286014189191
A hand plucking the
harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	649.647829507783
Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide.	473.74022067534054
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green.	399.27887238751333
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	276.4844956652779
Fergus’
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	262.2981508646348
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	185.76111673195135
Silent with awe and
pity I went to her bedside.	277.5427450877006
For
those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.	402.2159646055598
Where now?	56.330396450281164
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	761.4968822071768
A birdcage hung in the
sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	195.65679203700756
She heard old Royce sing
in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he
sang:
	240.0116706292761
I am the boy
	91.32076488543095
That can enjoy
	223.88259412620184
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	750.3511227850126
And no more turn aside and brood.	232.761205857312
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	138.18435619094214
Memories beset his
brooding brain.	661.7395268401214
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
approached the sacrament.	204.08723002015643
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	420.80191181937056
Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
shirts.	398.400285951494
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	298.06282084184767
On
me alone.	121.43937903584795
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	332.8729923478585
Ghostly light on the
tortured face.	166.12396820094278
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
prayed on their knees.	450.96443438330783
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	134.34057338955918
_Liliata
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum
chorus excipiat._
	1599.599187096903
Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
	277.948884258933
No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	199.9374059481047
—Kinch ahoy!
	464.672675952932
Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.	247.524063097102
It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again.	261.53739141365435
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	266.00772194615223
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	182.1396278034662
Breakfast is ready.	131.1611277904685
Haines is
apologising for waking us last night.	336.3402367294915
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.	298.2294704591347
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	476.166348041347
For my sake and for all our
sakes.	188.36133561156916
His head disappeared and reappeared.	312.7157402345439
—I told him your symbol of Irish art.	277.5384552187474
He says it’s very clever.	144.65438850026308
Touch
him for a quid, will you?	99.37123955291541
A guinea, I mean.	537.172968115195
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	289.81882200131633
—The school kip?	405.9056770975978
Buck Mulligan said.	165.5081573229974
How much?	79.33166529084998
Four quid?	156.73455501773446
Lend us one.	89.91642387153766
—If you want it, Stephen said.	146.7864913815288
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	735.3807231293108
We’ll have
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	364.7537371182234
Four omnipotent
sovereigns.	759.2337503533817
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a Cockney accent:
	281.48411265507656
O, won’t we have a merry time,
	171.41023612478926
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
	341.37618388754913
On coronation,
	266.01283497161296
Coronation day!
	68.03423360298575
O, won’t we have a merry time
	171.41023612478926
On coronation day!
	283.9893042190271
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	335.7590961248445
The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet.	554.4651028450974
Why should I bring it down?	276.661129025644
Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?	271.25534881888376
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	247.42353589338637
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	318.64490019117284
I am another now
and yet the same.	130.94149558304898
A servant too.	204.88103848238094
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow.	452.67705218275194
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	357.16491477721706
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	412.9263292282872
Haines, open that door, will you?	130.57914082826667
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	179.14677976755567
A tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.	256.21424202226854
—Have you the key?	76.23913112729181
a voice asked.	126.41125978030705
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	253.47022259501188
Janey Mack, I’m choked!
	662.4048467921382
He howled, without looking up from the fire:
	223.8112171392561
—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	175.4345394703067
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	449.04965887757504
Haines stood at the
doorway, looking out.	145.8038603673517
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait.	246.23635993974403
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him.	234.31186481740838
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.	210.60665647890457
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	200.79615502904852
But, hush! Not a
word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	534.673380948944
Haines, come in.	57.0162085438271
The grub is ready.	352.88687978087404
Where’s the sugar?	74.25806351070251
O, jay, there’s no milk.	228.32158142326264
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker.	176.70528299755452
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	300.8388830901133
I told her to come after eight.	162.50843611278043
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	358.6251861190273
There’s a lemon in the
locker.	104.36811601899963
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	448.4565080889641
I want Sandycove
milk.	374.62008409326
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
	106.3478609326128
—That woman is coming up with the milk.	119.4636938114279
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair.	394.0074138801527
Sit down.	55.84759960226763
Pour out the tea there.	83.97736223806929
The sugar is in the bag.	119.16072251559964
Here,
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	345.0473951465355
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:
	276.142732682011
—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._
	1052.2074225734611
Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	168.67719845459655
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.	216.80925290666562
But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?	317.65443291442875
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
woman’s wheedling voice:
	363.560403318028
—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	512.5341431719517
And when I
makes water I makes water.	546.2487945633993
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	252.6006256444376
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
	374.179986499324
—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.	322.2441575269776
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
send you don’t make them in the one pot._
	279.1511862046375
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.	369.1358060861728
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	262.0042800375091
Five lines
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum.	232.51414363416413
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	134.71997583289522
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:
	261.2136736890346
—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	206.50867445824503
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	334.4158808906976
—Do you now?	62.25599914064697
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	143.66616733182698
Your reasons, pray?	401.9968080650376
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion.	188.72036584391964
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	411.9318414475891
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.	268.3397536581497
—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	240.7526048044354
Do you think she was?	82.43541098962157
Quite charming!
	181.7795254622155
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
	371.38084121860066
_—For old Mary Ann
	593.421024636286
She doesn’t care a damn.	220.54779512749542
But, hising up her petticoats..._
	254.40494983017467
He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	321.11283787093225
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	345.9679611943032
—The milk, sir!
	172.75442336838714
—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.	234.89344943981638
Kinch, get the jug.	123.3574779742367
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.	250.08535702382784
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	121.7526010792445
Glory be to God.	123.82655783101062
—To whom?	121.46512028879313
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	124.9670925838189
Ah, to be sure!
	75.73983475909847
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	195.58512070320347
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.	479.2390999203091
—How much, sir?	131.8937059131627
asked the old woman.	64.03922319792376
—A quart, Stephen said.	366.23761078522557
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers.	340.79755092301
Old shrunken paps.	829.2238520260715
She poured again a measureful and a
tilly.	250.4088306785226
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger.	229.52752817071962
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	191.87123280798346
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	377.3056539568077
They
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	523.5874618542848
Silk of the kine and
poor old woman, names given her in old times.	170.77878107776112
A wandering crone, lowly
form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	522.9988371001087
To serve or to
upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	333.7307368008763
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	557.0116636291366
—Taste it, sir, she said.	83.68769092859765
He drank at her bidding.	228.80499539434126
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts.	241.94130290700986
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.	479.303540848173
—Are you a medical student, sir?	182.70901546270937
the old woman asked.	136.4532561456567
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.	631.5848531152675
—Look at that now, she said.	79.19842315997928
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	378.93279053558945
She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights.	272.88865496462057
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.	202.5694282762869
And to the loud voice that now bids
her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	258.9274089486917
—Do you understand what he says?	106.95428566559485
Stephen asked her.	78.66138157552582
—Is it French you are talking, sir?	195.68046218809172
the old woman said to Haines.	150.37253056824792
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	279.1438901399651
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	339.27239792854846
Is there Gaelic on you?	128.538990376132
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	116.40102409068132
Are you from the
west, sir?	104.09106252745363
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	443.9735460432455
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
Irish in Ireland.	310.6295220678562
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
the language myself.	249.56584617135383
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.	160.21748707404015
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	195.0032958412621
Wonderful entirely.	249.72410360095353
Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch.	274.4589770020528
Would you like a cup, ma’am?	171.49804676768963
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	161.4825521781835
Haines said to her:
	48.04416740477644
—Have you your bill?	144.07074400535967
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?	302.5827631331723
Stephen filled again the three cups.	247.7417934383889
—Bill, sir?	71.8721773002824
she said, halting.	212.7628697187874
Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	326.07962922068725
That’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	101.14991147457347
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
his trouser pockets.	409.4674580008421
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	190.4923245466292
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk.	427.5585458113127
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:
	222.40462349639643
—A miracle!
	365.4416887200119
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
	160.20169688321351
—Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	139.1716495475836
All I can give you I give.	337.6125364388984
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	204.44546861959105
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.	247.7142221717742
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	186.97970931050898
Time enough.	106.56447059563713
Good
morning, sir.	142.47583933994568
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
	478.699943683345
_—Heart of my heart, were it more,
	153.63945809210162
More would be laid at your feet._
	158.54620361164328
He turned to Stephen and said:
	120.43019841727781
—Seriously, Dedalus.	203.15938669399281
I’m stony.	262.80812497370783
Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money.	234.15860910164741
Today the bards must drink and junket.	254.13930366822166
Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.	260.9757268642256
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today.	416.600592299496
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	503.0822702315584
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
	249.57723859796104
—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	262.03078813848
Then he said to Haines:
	94.7463753330899
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	340.84696346347823
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.	287.4961371592353
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
	249.2478413011633
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	222.50590906192218
Speaking to me.	41.94737764123746
They wash and tub and scrub.	299.53633554336244
Agenbite of inwit.	109.87096133473105
Yet here’s a spot.	107.83498772889477
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good.	260.2989882865164
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
warmth of tone:
	257.7192653099897
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	251.4028966735069
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	373.4788294337917
I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	150.13595298655653
—Would I make any money by it?	219.59063910046083
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:
	168.54899212742342
He strolled out to the doorway.	132.47833991460524
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
and said with coarse vigour:
	370.65568954221936
—You put your hoof in it now.	151.69333480910484
What did you say that for?	85.28424913489906
Stephen said.	39.3877482893773
The problem is to get money.	164.32149866979677
From whom?	121.46512028879313
From the
milkwoman or from him.	122.6305298944055
It’s a toss up, I think.	217.7249109569513
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	356.4423871500928
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	170.5094394097673
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.	351.1636535921812
—From me, Kinch, he said.	119.17561937804311
In a suddenly changed tone he added:
	252.64203757462113
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.	236.78687440678297
Damn all else they
are good for.	135.38054118648276
Why don’t you play them as I do?	204.48102284037589
To hell with them all.	109.63264926769685
Let us get out of the kip.	121.6694274191294
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:
	415.21159896924974
—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	171.71042442801917
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	158.52096173201826
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	297.345000451696
His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	268.1027572821607
God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character.	176.86201058425496
I want puce gloves and green
boots.	371.2673814771568
Do I contradict myself?	742.4844748759131
Very well then, I
contradict myself.	510.1283901922276
Mercurial Malachi.	203.15938669399281
A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.	336.0943783238576
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	186.6058406868255
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	106.68835378034619
Haines called to them from the
doorway:
	104.13132252820931
—Are you coming, you fellows?	142.75990481615997
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	382.1893462761246
Come out,
Kinch.	178.2364405685306
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	304.91150244327866
Resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
	308.2336687151967
—And going forth he met Butterly.	286.95638493308775
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it.	238.45028395434002
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	216.97388941905032
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
	215.87815151617275
—Did you bring the key?	128.24893212492972
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	216.8811449724631
He walked on.	92.71568396539735
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	430.27211427951244
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
	321.3884129500664
Haines asked:
	75.71580409413632
—Do you pay rent for this tower?	254.85791523246476
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	470.4759598640635
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	274.9034983845318
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
	296.60599069078717
—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	569.6787503774904
Martello you call it?	77.67593599634493
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea.	269.55504735970214
But ours is the _omphalos_.	218.09754374658144
—What is your idea of Hamlet?	167.3397675449401
Haines asked Stephen.	256.11873880180303
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	457.8720666701548
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	259.27164568101756
Wait till I
have a few pints in me first.	220.90949685547312
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:
	290.84774055652707
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	361.71707407214336
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	406.882873163868
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	778.526241330718
Is it some paradox?	187.58913508232314
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	339.27239792854846
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	266.3862411450854
It’s quite simple.	167.97346906076916
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.	221.89881701293788
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	222.77413008397585
He himself?	71.51370192134448
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
	383.67421371390043
—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
	214.0273175404661
And it is
rather long to tell.	121.24021398088439
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	355.5954490930631
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	307.34255815459414
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	385.05483757853483
_That
beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?	242.1999547440775
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
not speak.	360.4043067703991
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	491.42122769308577
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	297.97878408974486
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	322.2560483991951
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the Muglins.	335.4864913577716
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	256.7137660157878
The Father and the Son idea.	202.02430473992862
The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father.	343.15619586094664
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	373.1415272321455
He looked
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	401.443573704308
He moved
a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
	259.60775275950317
_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	256.02539111268726
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.	134.5963112068442
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	654.38878122111
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._
	158.52426124918267
He held up a forefinger of warning.	191.62972856637697
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again._
	481.09846955140466
He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
	258.3984707351709
_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	501.709595534236
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy...	406.5535125230492
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_
	140.67528948424706
He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	471.36498308221263
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:
	292.92413723666965
—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.	383.2889907226986
He’s rather blasphemous.	262.0720630620101
I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say.	138.92039338281552
Joseph the Joiner?	92.86513674241486
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	631.2520585831983
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	168.78618944125202
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	360.6981491466574
—You’re not a believer, are you?	146.95645185448444
Haines asked.	75.71580409413632
I mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word.	153.00910223128824
Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God.	208.32453120310157
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	145.03248091301484
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
green stone.	270.9884267362949
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	177.6967056255006
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	205.77523212040506
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	170.11934010070235
He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	274.1107227218968
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	95.9965722627565
Either you believe or
you don’t, isn’t it?	149.53486783256682
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal God.	322.89622129645585
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?	234.43050939513242
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought.	374.12445481971065
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
side.	201.2871637320795
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	379.36280189170844
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
along the path.	642.4863133320667
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	152.0325368892558
He wants that key.	208.95522034246494
It is mine.	109.79896665933813
I paid the rent.	169.3898099990772
Give him the key too.	97.92216287655312
He will ask for it.	112.38575619451616
That was in his
eyes.	55.26568540145871
—After all, Haines began...	257.0091256596129
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
not all unkind.	200.05880614291843
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	301.96504015027995
You are your
own master, it seems to me.	158.45062083594075
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
Italian.	281.32161143269167
Haines said.	39.3877482893773
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	343.9744732521493
Kneel down before me.	110.16530807363266
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	275.0426705787506
Haines said again.	80.63694684176467
What do you mean?	109.58321486795005
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	549.477459252143
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.	365.0893811096364
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	202.2425101587509
An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay.	403.84125639623954
We feel in England that we have treated you
rather unfairly.	315.6453880858539
It seems history is to blame.	239.65729807659375
Symbol of the apostles in the mass
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	368.42532351673157
A horde of heresies
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	450.9160859935392
Words Mulligan had spoken
a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	237.38628459844188
Idle mockery.	216.98246382346196
The void
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
shields.	321.2472743458369
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	541.8857576645818
_Zut! Nom de Dieu!_
	358.92099290902786
—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.	276.72130380061145
I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	241.44124784086665
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.	378.5825915788611
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,
boatman.	333.4760220548215
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.	299.14732377617634
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	251.34647432900567
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.	144.4440326460031
It’ll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one.	178.58275748905754
It’s nine days today.	218.23685467769704
The man that was drowned.	126.52033849284746
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
saltwhite.	365.7005379722734
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	214.22037925947575
Buck Mulligan stood
on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his
shoulder.	377.89328965790514
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly
frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	261.0810639818623
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?	120.81956824048716
—Down in Westmeath.	119.91274847764197
With the Bannons.	92.86513674241486
—Still there?	45.93688314776555
I got a card from Bannon.	202.29329688312774
Says he found a sweet young
thing down there.	159.08486107397903
Photo girl he calls her.	126.7034811282676
—Snapshot, eh?	118.07692457180981
Brief exposure.	266.01283497161296
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	323.45268116252674
An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face.	292.1524080239371
He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.	380.7450599564253
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
lips and breastbone.	336.3083929413861
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock.	194.71728891546127
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	132.45774728573386
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	342.7787362485807
—Going over next week to stew.	285.59809418203537
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	357.65223368669245
—Spooning with him last night on the pier.	118.043845265014
The father is rotto with
money.	204.02637713414853
—Is she up the pole?	110.93606475699269
—Better ask Seymour that.	222.23610148748247
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	425.088006664912
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:
	235.78502018264888
—Redheaded women buck like goats.	330.4919938052946
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	342.66091193661924
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	378.2830631221742
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen.	304.86396753703195
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.	190.2729266905097
—Are you going in here, Malachi?	155.98154766648057
Make room in the bed.	87.5982048982141
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	260.39373086761174
Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.	208.50282327005732
Buck Mulligan asked.	255.87999104604643
—Later on, Haines said.	136.0142778693732
Not on my breakfast.	126.41032201599361
Stephen turned away.	143.19803351319464
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.	165.15780741919107
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	468.833867183012
Stephen handed him the key.	142.95643364051836
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.	410.13908581626083
—And twopence, he said, for a pint.	136.50934570832462
Throw it there.	52.000138054699796
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	298.66796319821503
Dressing, undressing.	365.4416887200119
Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
	404.87379336270175
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	201.96817036388114
Thus spake
Zarathustra.	665.4413822859577
His plump body plunged.	528.4830205309847
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
path and smiling at wild Irish.	302.77600891340126
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	147.89703508129125
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	761.4650559799675
Half twelve.	152.27007882261205
—Good, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	333.84629112222774
Liliata rutilantium.	266.0083962612288
Turma circumdet.	317.52817152557833
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	353.8112411175428
I will
not sleep here tonight.	247.47212997597657
Home also I cannot go.	461.2025771562705
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	187.95063281827336
Turning
the curve he waved his hand.	150.910239086342
It called again.	148.33433679286503
A sleek brown head, a
seal’s, far out on the water, round.	224.78760396757409
—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	237.28346806423332
—Tarentum, sir.	71.8721773002824
—Very good.	62.856475137626155
—There was a battle, sir.	131.27077904684072
—Very good.	62.856475137626155
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.	261.51672330902863
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	111.14527633145174
And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it.	174.76250029425307
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings
of excess.	394.02934112939045
What’s left us then?	118.22183235229517
—I forget the place, sir.	137.8598941381883
279 B.	203.15938669399281
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
gorescarred book.	209.70252526923215
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
for._
	159.38744385615402
That phrase the world had remembered.	205.71805222351733
A dull ease of the mind.	187.38365692668273
From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear.	354.7661270563582
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	339.27239792854846
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	99.47031973497101
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?	145.21441928488457
—I know, sir.	112.37543180480125
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	184.46593323262314
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	212.54128562295554
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel.	482.47382166875036
He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	361.8585751742513
Crumbs adhered
to the tissue of his lips.	146.16953734345486
A sweetened boy’s breath.	344.1281428667413
Welloff people,
proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	217.36410392345877
Vico Road, Dalkey.	494.0867752080217
—Pyrrhus, sir?	71.8721773002824
Pyrrhus, a pier.	107.18363365197102
All laughed.	130.51080469431187
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	532.2735909602337
Armstrong looked round
at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	399.7278920756117
In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	267.32876441095647
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
what is a pier.	186.62009357268337
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	348.23642146658284
A thing out in the water.	79.91607240092253
A kind of a
bridge.	95.41271546826849
Kingstown pier, sir.	251.41166983207887
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	355.64184447460076
Two in the back bench
whispered.	147.48833390397604
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	409.8550184826268
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	722.6102661600805
Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
tittering in the struggle.	450.59708141761007
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	344.28688388834155
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	220.15721231612036
The words troubled their gaze.	352.4309712706878
—How, sir?	71.8721773002824
Comyn asked.	75.71580409413632
A bridge is across a river.	206.86397327560167
For Haines’s chapbook.	364.4108208106787
No-one here to hear.	102.92665030312362
Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	331.5842239622146
What then?	51.270025270301566
A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master’s praise.	352.45531998840545
Why had they chosen all that part?	176.60761322548058
Not wholly
for the smooth caress.	322.31268850393974
For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	261.5833295001613
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death.	367.6065148369687
They are not to be thought away.	119.95605085857134
Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted.	257.544486714743
But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were?	214.6989468002481
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	158.16864817295868
Weave, weaver of the wind.	150.35591691331092
—Tell us a story, sir.	148.60709186483805
—O, do, sir.	103.9891573041067
A ghoststory.	317.5334699131929
—Where do you begin in this?	126.6834166951661
Stephen asked, opening another book.	331.16301908045904
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.	151.58505316349817
—Go on then, Talbot.	155.02747810289964
—And the story, sir?	107.37661059466205
—After, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
Go on, Talbot.	146.0554807867269
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel.	334.8112276854827
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
	396.2914584615528
_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._
	480.25065692160166
It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	193.522874608836
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where
he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	322.3888344214993
By his
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	451.1880688769965
Fed and feeding
brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating
feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	530.459264109695
Thought
is the thought of thought.	78.51380637387784
Tranquil brightness.	209.20222464996462
The soul is in a manner
all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	116.09444003430934
Tranquility sudden, vast,
candescent: form of forms.	521.8931660439898
Talbot repeated:
	174.05701931214955
_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
	198.07959645699654
Through the dear might..._
	86.28770067722601
—Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	257.6794960931283
I don’t see anything.	159.66927304509036
—What, sir?	71.8721773002824
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	386.3232912538313
His hand turned the page over.	145.67621355281176
He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered.	245.26529540172842
Of him that walked the waves.	103.72641091417854
Here also over these
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and
on mine.	247.04283965004194
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute.	284.3986971402244
To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s.	232.24971051199208
A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
church’s looms.	268.4646508417161
Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	493.5047305421251
My father gave me seeds to sow.	297.76949664827606
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	319.1266921312271
—Have I heard all?	218.52043469739323
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
Hockey at ten, sir.	140.77580058208153
—Half day, sir.	118.5317445733037
—Who can answer a riddle?	205.21229728247735
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	1093.377984129365
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:
	564.607164265556
—A riddle, sir?	257.9198845172751
Ask me, sir.	87.18183317227657
—O, ask me, sir.	157.72421406921586
—A hard one, sir.	161.87315639846034
—This is the riddle, Stephen said:
	169.89207391588806
The cock crew,
	529.8387103011924
The sky was blue:
	195.95061363802785
The bells in heaven
	185.58211042516038
Were striking eleven.	354.61146391302134
’Tis time for this poor soul
	161.79748862168495
To go to heaven.	120.31366316577002
What is that?	43.8437134325822
—What, sir?	71.8721773002824
—Again, sir.	71.8721773002824
We didn’t hear.	168.5431008943405
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	314.14052820369426
After a silence
Cochrane said:
	180.36400525333883
—What is it, sir?	75.65184939207523
We give it up.	86.01322611436301
Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
	337.2190523889948
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	411.50152063650813
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.	308.0492303858103
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
	149.07234849499764
They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	479.65484704930094
Quickly
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
clamour of their boots and tongues.	196.64265396747447
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook.	493.83742294524853
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	501.507658875826
On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail’s bed.	369.72236086653766
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	257.47314198320333
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
blind loops and a blot.	274.93740192380227
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	200.8929141021662
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
to you, sir.	147.86840012234097
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	128.3297227900333
—Do you understand how to do them now?	134.98714740275608
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	385.7948673341744
Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir.	237.39400050853513
—Can you do them yourself?	134.49580839312702
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
—No, sir.	71.8721773002824
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail’s bed.	282.0451523152779
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart.	163.84391665455036
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	261.6776605000005
She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own.	366.7479335198756
Was that then real?	120.45500977964981
The only true thing in
life?	169.00537366743856
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode.	530.5437026303438
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	261.2417957323433
She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	366.2813556477453
A poor
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	386.34700150066163
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	271.3583111620846
He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.	410.5956403278807
Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses.	563.605502446045
Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	176.70974427895
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	344.48069079083183
Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	345.8266473713052
Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.	337.0832483236332
—Do you understand now?	127.94457381482064
Can you work the second for yourself?	126.96808638806522
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	751.8990975068473
Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	349.5845251702658
_Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive.	622.8691840914698
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	346.47807608948233
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	461.66115017972635
My
childhood bends beside me.	446.0305702815516
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly.	164.43241714354846
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	137.22033351146868
Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	479.56381855844785
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	196.72514532634926
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
Thanks, Sargent answered.	325.6971366631216
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	255.52081562987493
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.	191.1817638201191
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	168.20573590674246
—Run on, Stephen said.	136.0142778693732
Mr Deasy is calling you.	227.3573497565618
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife.	340.7804556334512
They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	528.1660042467163
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
him.	263.0576278200751
He turned his angry white moustache.	299.14805513486846
—What is it now?	66.76497655061603
he cried continually without listening.	525.4122926809281
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	180.9279007840058
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
order here.	360.49486465395273
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
cried sternly:
	257.37488938719446
—What is the matter?	65.20560987933293
What is it now?	66.76497655061603
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
illdyed head.	375.08538029341173
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
leather of its chairs.	331.7994621794366
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	126.1453572388255
As it was in the beginning, is now.	78.04614836520537
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	279.4251743735673
And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without end.	429.92508077071517
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	224.67112247909625
Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	325.49836554082003
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.	275.6885675925455
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	251.1568746232326
It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table.	229.51934659514455
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	244.6652908766092
And now his strongroom for the gold.	138.60042286175687
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James.	409.3808020415278
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	234.87889268409018
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	259.9768874796897
These are handy things to have.	180.76747555286386
This is for sovereigns.	142.78524534756218
This is
for shillings.	101.35767077736989
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	365.4416887200119
And here crowns.	234.07441418997578
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	209.89994436246374
—Three twelve, he said.	100.45894424647322
I think you’ll find that’s right.	139.45174937117784
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	203.87786688142842
—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	286.289995291686
You have earned it.	180.1217326452831
Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	201.07278582210992
Symbols too
of beauty and of power.	89.72627328051024
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
and misery.	394.391791983817
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	241.2142617317401
You’ll pull it out somewhere
and lose it.	188.92721671265562
You just buy one of these machines.	247.9348422964854
You’ll find them very
handy.	299.24575131519083
Answer something.	77.1097993735296
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	299.27011462920206
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	176.5422089004523
Three times
now.	133.20382686557605
Three nooses round me here.	309.55445157485656
I can break them in this instant
if I will.	270.3982555411632
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	331.11946471836364
You don’t
know yet what money is.	176.6639111482453
Money is power.	96.11644106618174
When you have lived as long as
I have.	196.28007842539927
I know, I know.	236.59697397128343
If youth but knew.	208.21488283301778
But what does Shakespeare
say?	249.79012503162951
_Put but money in thy purse._
	187.29273776499355
—Iago, Stephen murmured.	492.86248104692726
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.	191.57336690635583
—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	286.15217502908837
He made money.	151.23529832633716
A poet, yes, but
an Englishman too.	267.15620645536035
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	107.27915959307586
Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
mouth?	200.0224974274133
The seas’ ruler.	570.4659765383949
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	264.9454294493097
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	236.38131200352257
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	544.0370749890304
That’s not English.	135.35438360873474
A French Celt said that.	242.23816806170376
He
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	379.437969178211
_I paid
my way._
	135.3970776036416
Good man, good man.	117.80193524958811
_—I paid my way.	291.97201567221174
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
that?	209.6864241392836
_I owe nothing._ Can you?	286.4722143191772
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	604.4050999823726
Curran, ten guineas.	299.1597758617556
McCann, one guinea.	162.08301267763292
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	310.29896250211726
Temple, two lunches.	314.3780190971523
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
weeks’ board.	908.3728482202298
The lump I have is useless.	412.59713702054825
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	199.70595489192337
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	482.97376632641374
—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously.	199.7696657259714
But one day you must feel it.	131.82315079101056
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	221.67575151075263
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	381.41398679512395
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
Wales.	432.8966818914021
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	262.03889133600705
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.	465.58478935003467
I remember the famine
in ’46.	217.1269463176802
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your
communion denounced him as a demagogue?	338.7305217874272
You fenians forget some things.	524.0669814349478
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	328.71085144445647
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	397.195628089962
Hoarse, masked and armed, the
planters’ covenant.	491.9793224075419
The black north and true blue bible.	330.84067330711315
Croppies lie
down.	164.96682334063004
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	501.352126625119
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	318.6759446995177
On the spindle side.	183.6134305103777
But
I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	495.2902747227814
—Alas, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	771.718470471664
He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so.	197.12636678733458
Lal the ral the ra
	142.89288848616707
The rocky road to Dublin.	381.90137575384614
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	921.7851773473491
Soft day, sir John!
Soft day, your honour!...	436.8543292604946
Two topboots jog dangling on
to Dublin.	561.9907281635525
Lal the ral the ra.	142.89288848616707
Lal the ral the raddy.	169.93027477008044
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	429.97802258195736
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends.	278.28016218856055
I have a letter here for the press.	114.41442716722182
Sit down a moment.	86.45102453356614
I have just to copy the end.	127.22319576050636
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	189.88387049483885
—Sit down.	55.84759960226763
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
common sense._ Just a moment.	231.69791104833195
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	353.07688264089245
Framed
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of
Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de
Paris_, 1866.	529.5286900756898
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	324.6654113983795
He saw their
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
crowds.	383.4457481221184
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	622.3730121400201
Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush.	423.6249912363036
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to
one the field.	264.0020579457992
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,
the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s
dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	384.8768259669155
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	350.71286152959493
Again: a goal.	117.1559438785292
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life.	281.4120396781019
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling
who seems to be slightly crawsick?	373.45998027502696
Time shocked rebounds, shock
by shock.	923.6853279692434
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of
the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.	405.368785033806
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	387.2018050282833
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	218.22596765274312
Stephen stood up.	110.8653403964626
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	273.05136257584314
It’s about the
foot and mouth disease.	119.81664454145191
Just look through it.	105.15347224888956
There can be no two
opinions on the matter.	163.55642343487983
May I trespass on your valuable space.	552.2157090853847
That doctrine of _laissez faire_
which so often in our history.	415.0419926897154
Our cattle trade.	413.960452466494
The way of all our old
industries.	166.52594140494224
Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.	565.9450398878271
European conflagration.	464.672675952932
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
channel.	276.0975963598167
The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
agriculture.	344.8421923843474
Pardoned a classical allusion.	272.9822510762045
By a woman who
was no better than she should be.	147.1170307616176
To come to the point at issue.	127.73247579523205
—I don’t mince words, do I?	393.0802167098067
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	301.79660327019315
Foot and mouth disease.	133.29135648464958
Known as Koch’s preparation.	269.0787444030412
Serum and virus.	146.38760187934352
Percentage of salted horses.	236.96066495227169
Emperor’s horses at Mürzsteg,
lower Austria.	400.8917226900533
Veterinary surgeons.	464.672675952932
Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	770.5244035147354
Courteous
offer a fair trial.	329.01053727330844
Dictates of common sense.	168.57972131957447
Allimportant question.	126.16834706296119
In
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	147.72019155853346
Thanking you for
the hospitality of your columns.	133.7298517358285
—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	214.47621225292218
You will see at the
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	315.0735490428963
And it can be
cured.	165.8790968711379
It is cured.	170.4202641615837
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	466.7556083119658
They
offer to come over here.	180.3664289414229
I am trying to work up influence with the
department.	208.48283502999445
Now I’m going to try publicity.	344.40999018123944
I am surrounded by
difficulties, by...	351.80210881034094
intrigues by...	38.74330281071631
backstairs influence by...	134.39663379006942
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	283.18044914881386
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	237.24590777837352
England is in the hands of the
jews.	63.624348507709065
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	248.01638486329625
Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation’s vital strength.	311.9523433127669
I have seen it coming these years.	210.438809537575
As sure as
we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction.	273.3082683314723
Old England is dying.	266.6219769862326
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam.	299.4965189604447
He faced about and back again.	187.28082907184256
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	123.31084339343927
The harlot’s cry from street to street
	201.52432646977724
Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.	465.32913978828753
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.	331.0936855298631
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not?	369.25436456837826
—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	404.8476025607229
And you can see
the darkness in their eyes.	115.61088316567097
And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day.	140.36618541906458
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	422.94608312691173
Gabble of geese.	108.4578802029746
They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats.	828.4534433979736
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	641.0553648939541
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
zeal was vain.	377.08935459922526
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	315.30685176860464
Time surely would
scatter all.	354.4168303445123
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	364.2803352464519
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
dishonours of their flesh.	236.25778913142392
Stephen said.	39.3877482893773
—What do you mean?	109.58321486795005
Mr Deasy asked.	255.87999104604643
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	144.03821859938742
His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly.	790.3239795141665
Is this old wisdom?	184.10849913537072
He waits to hear from
me.	160.4819492086661
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	310.2824512881963
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	187.8309821668532
A whirring whistle: goal.	958.7034718875544
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	191.47029766567456
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	294.42042818312797
All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	458.123723750348
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
	277.0310444925357
—That is God.	159.40530101824655
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
	494.0867752080217
Mr Deasy asked.	255.87999104604643
—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	317.23265707934286
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers.	262.140688332479
—I am happier than you are, he said.	175.43929108658193
We have committed many errors and
many sins.	416.95084891230647
A woman brought sin into the world.	186.2747589733195
For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
years the Greeks made war on Troy.	281.5661621478611
A faithless wife first brought the
strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	428.6253146502576
A woman too brought Parnell low.	370.3078171469113
Many
errors, many failures but not the one sin.	304.45526486736554
I am a struggler now at the
end of my days.	150.543074673076
But I will fight for the right till the end.	185.71580315184522
For Ulster will fight
	377.35676067880013
And Ulster will be right.	216.87234966978195
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	118.20696259741547
—Well, sir, he began.	120.1001094994219
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
this work.	315.6868605846948
Perhaps I am
wrong.	382.81691504606874
And here what will you learn more?	170.2194294456328
Mr Deasy shook his head.	259.0933058797605
—Who knows?	105.53615530262273
To learn one must be humble.	285.83657095071544
But life is the great
teacher.	171.50027543897093
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	258.6559124875199
—As regards these, he began.	258.1111092607751
—Yes, Mr Deasy said.	339.27239792854846
You have two copies there.	187.9653547261671
If you can have them
published at once.	189.2344678398823
_ Telegraph.	203.15938669399281
Irish Homestead._
	137.22421879471196
—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	225.12436761852027
I know two
editors slightly.	403.03220544267066
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	424.4924998044325
I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P.	572.2741323128071
There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
City Arms hotel.	273.9387140757553
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	166.1880444892295
You
see if you can get it into your two papers.	176.87083253522718
What are they?	69.07460521413789
_—The Evening Telegraph..._
	466.39385676175857
—That will do, Mr Deasy said.	300.8248238059509
There is no time to lose.	128.13762606711157
Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin.	227.59654129206393
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	218.32951296189646
Thank you.	32.76073075102579
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	223.92289376750304
I
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	204.5987355810334
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	272.15933082599804
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	217.56291293955357
The
lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors.	358.96143268671085
Still I will help him in his fight.	216.49492999353973
Mulligan will
dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	272.02935905665214
—Mr Dedalus!
	203.15938669399281
Running after me.	75.11648720611602
No more letters, I hope.	407.9812025386537
—Just one moment.	112.66359738349598
—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	214.814352072287
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	458.2206007382461
—I just wanted to say, he said.	109.1618094584502
Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	184.26447490175843
Do you know
that?	62.54899558365249
And do you know why?	114.48053254660998
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	267.7751811884541
—Why, sir?	71.8721773002824
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	212.4404458607859
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	278.9333154377893
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm.	387.21927191297556
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.	308.795637092809
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	206.26932596403068
That’s why.	69.90675123651354
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.	409.2380954624239
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes.	195.8504049706505
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	363.5128753512345
Snotgreen, bluesilver,
rust: coloured signs.	1592.0411784761025
Limits of the diaphane.	71.8381380396372
But he adds: in bodies.	209.21274469870085
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	181.55223734130092
By
knocking his sconce against them, sure.	359.5170622383818
Go easy.	142.95568335134703
Bald he was and a
millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	523.4723410175236
Limit of the diaphane in.	64.4268530587095
Why in?	24.26587054336645
Diaphane, adiaphane.	317.52817152557833
If you can put your five fingers through
it it is a gate, if not a door.	160.15594217669712
Shut your eyes and see.	89.14472972525944
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
shells.	347.641884889469
You are walking through it howsomever.	265.5959450743288
I am, a stride at a
time.	130.57106293901265
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	272.5481981733335
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	199.7907301266754
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable
modality of the audible.	126.26749186960359
Open your eyes.	92.35754823968135
Jesus! If I fell over a
cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_
ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	430.7185457776728
My ash sword hangs at
my side.	476.46458856571104
Tap with it: they do.	69.68327672858666
My two feet in his boots are at the ends
of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	172.24171675794972
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los
Demiurgos_.	338.50046059108865
Crush,
crack, crick, crick.	955.9813065802335
Wild sea money.	172.4949513216079
Dominie Deasy kens them a’.	325.2539999802067
Madeline the mare?	81.0607408250338
Rhythm begins, you see.	157.54249885563885
I hear.	86.19829124840263
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs
marching.	1002.9220284204994
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	751.1583649330488
Open your eyes now.	115.27958249933141
I will.	60.46787389028839
One moment.	98.02999451877047
Has all vanished since?	273.1618788983676
If I
open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	196.60875274215337
_Basta!_ I will see if I
can see.	261.29127803881215
See now.	56.330396450281164
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
without end.	159.86396198032634
They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently,
_Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed
feet sinking in the silted sand.	445.9590724792254
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our
mighty mother.	256.9639458809074
Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s
gamp poked in the beach.	325.1239397975372
Mrs
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of
Bride Street.	778.8144503185129
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	340.31066797268767
Creation from nothing.	101.50801083039903
What has she in the bag?	87.91627816225613
A misbirth with a
trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	683.742441833972
The cords of all link back,
strandentwining cable of all flesh.	420.6206605066734
That is why mystic monks.	364.4961372600958
Will you
be as gods?	125.3045063904839
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	152.13564371975988
Kinch here.	64.56289892777333
Put me on to
Edenville.	111.08683058292283
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	518.9917438116396
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	614.4620230932246
She had no navel.	193.5652980870492
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,
whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
everlasting.	694.3030619936391
Womb of sin.	76.84120940335585
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	346.9728249285072
By them, the man
with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	135.13630351060655
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will.	254.4884684954191
From before the ages
He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	248.13021835659958
A _lex eterna_ stays
about Him.	1043.4891932324479
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
consubstantial?	406.06475780849024
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	353.61543706550304
Warring
his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	178.86975208294731
Illstarred
heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	610.352539758269
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	645.7371121229696
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	588.689900940626
They are coming, waves.	209.16451162247316
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
Mananaan.	916.6229028057807
I mustn’t forget his letter for the press.	217.59788144559693
And after?	56.88514550746489
The Ship, half
twelve.	432.18334524967537
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	181.71772280927266
Yes, I must.	243.89566499920753
His pace slackened.	617.4725989545167
Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not?	246.44743871072413
My
consubstantial father’s voice.	225.1602305056346
Did you see anything of your artist
brother Stephen lately?	337.9905089311728
Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace
with his aunt Sally?	206.39586398910143
Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	209.26343558063812
And
and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	207.07247610874052
O, weeping God, the
things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	519.6830904145578
The drunken little
costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	337.5490565005649
Highly respectable
gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	1161.3538688099677
Yes,
sir.	71.8721773002824
No, sir.	71.8721773002824
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
	253.97264192756862
I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	332.7269941634963
—It’s Stephen, sir.	174.83625687491428
—Let him in.	38.131012661829956
Let Stephen in.	119.8328491276341
—We thought you were someone else.	225.34005775591498
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over
the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	506.28994361512457
He has washed
the upper moiety.	348.67290410499635
—Morrow, nephew.	287.40150812754337
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the
eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	481.04723775652167
A bogoak frame over his
bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_.	520.7385061181274
The drone of his misleading whistle
brings Walter back.	523.5950628713446
—Yes, sir?	71.8721773002824
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother.	252.03294473270435
Where is she?	53.64544865458103
—Bathing Crissie, sir.	247.14538318118167
Papa’s little bedpal.	201.3392353244713
Lump of love.	55.23342018409985
—No, uncle Richie...	445.7118244195455
—Call me Richie.	176.19100763337974
Damn your lithia water.	323.41383465944693
It lowers.	464.672675952932
—Uncle Richie, really...	348.94546658347303
—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.	241.8792584375452
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	400.4071546419513
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	168.98314537377274
—He has nowhere to put it, you mug.	216.80403024660288
Bring in our chippendale chair.	280.9023714823741
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
here.	370.65676019239476
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?	240.88171129107872
So much the
better.	87.57512462120174
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	209.371050096232
_All’erta!_
	238.19223555623844
He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_.	970.8832688599665
The grandest number,
Stephen, in the whole opera.	346.36141737494216
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the
air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	529.8886306114093
This wind is sweeter.	283.687667603499
Houses of decay, mine, his and all.	120.01111810656339
You told the Clongowes gentry you
had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.	220.05278196155146
Come out of
them, Stephen.	119.66540487503076
Beauty is not there.	72.13246172463833
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s
library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	310.8094965273708
For
whom?	121.46512028879313
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	479.21314161520297
A hater of his
kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the
moon, his eyeballs stars.	260.6024630900657
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	464.672675952932
The oval equine
faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws.	1699.4747394768508
Abbas father,
furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?	476.1311073960226
Paff! _Descende,
calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.	2311.665878975799
A garland of grey hair on his
comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
(_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	387.7163113562313
Get down,
baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the
altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their
albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of
wheat.	527.3798586557442
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
it.	173.85663780938452
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	417.4281794951043
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
cheek.	294.3310979408327
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	258.8703764779728
Dan Occam thought of that,
invincible doctor.	301.7697370494789
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
his brain.	720.7387669261403
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
in diphthong.	299.04081168066483
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	175.81617939182442
You were
awfully holy, weren’t you?	301.2464038119292
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
might not have a red nose.	194.41490397576777
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue
that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from
the wet street.	268.6439167650915
_O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags
pinned round a squaw.	521.4696249681729
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth
tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about
that, eh?	320.68752210210675
What about what?	70.85123688454345
What else were they invented for?	220.25709742617312
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	436.3896484792405
I was young.	74.57158778728869
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
earnestly, striking face.	356.93250101528895
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one
saw: tell no-one.	323.6764869329937
Books you were going to write with letters for
titles.	184.95544074797638
Have you read his F?	155.80333103361656
O yes, but I prefer Q.	556.794144027527
Yes, but W is
wonderful.	258.22659793721925
O yes, W.	220.43266412802666
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval
leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great
libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	356.2245438312977
Someone was to read them
there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	184.59430711928903
Pico della
Mirandola like.	562.0442237703663
Ay, very like a whale.	165.93068907864824
When one reads these strange
pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who
once...	233.65327900531798
The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	322.3062214470629
His boots trod again a
damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	820.4942416918984
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
midden of man’s ashes.	569.3670012692996
He coasted them, walking warily.	598.2598546760996
A porterbottle
stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough.	512.310153646032
A sentinel:
isle of dreadful thirst.	752.9342430578051
Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.	422.75010924113803
Ringsend: wigwams
of brown steersmen and master mariners.	498.5993096806299
Human shells.	186.15671537036644
He halted.	134.20433472272816
I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s.	164.37179306226847
Am I not going there?	198.43834296083963
Seems not.	43.63875407829325
No-one about.	75.21370651634336
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer
sand towards the Pigeonhouse.	346.21294420353155
_—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_
	783.1140944799957
_—C’est le pigeon, Joseph._
	775.1446545046622
Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar
MacMahon.	309.0880316043633
Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris.	299.45259730779117
My father’s a
bird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump
bunny’s face.	391.4614001735932
Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_.	493.7900621997288
About
the nature of women he read in Michelet.	129.40277542756849
But he must send me _La Vie de
Jésus_ by M.	475.62549110563003
Léo Taxil.	203.15938669399281
Lent it to his friend.	69.1146893500978
_—C’est tordant, vous savez.	1626.799192262111
Moi, je suis socialiste.	1661.6575518474963
Je ne crois pas
en l’existence de Dieu.	1504.434716650737
Faut pas le dire à mon père._
	1269.8463603993812
_—Il croit?_
	445.7893368633957

Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt
from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge!_ Pretending to
speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence,
across the slimy pier at Newhaven.	603.0313809569635
_Comment?_ Rich booty you brought
back; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte

Well: _slainte!_ Around the

I was, faith.	116.07830299625248
Lover, for her
love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under
the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl
them upward in the fog.	373.78316081974083
Shattered glass and toppling masonry.	330.2533474556142
In gay
Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me.	483.32939796235286
Making his
day’s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the
Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d’Or,
damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.	485.2906399935421
Loveless, landless,
wifeless.	1247.7144807542668
She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in
rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers.	739.5624662254705
Peachy cheeks, a zebra
skirt, frisky as a young thing’s.	291.8379224069671
Spurned and undespairing.	159.89774194967887
Tell Pat
you saw me, won’t you?	190.40596795731162
_Mon
fils_, soldier of France.	549.9852994919713
I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny
are stout roaring blades_.	534.6784518868607
Know that old lay?	109.36039393618184
I taught Patrice that.	289.32677309848464
Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow’s castle on the Nore.	406.37161391166507
Goes like
this.	77.17251398678735
_O, O_.	203.15938669399281
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	239.76554175325683
O, O the boys of
	117.6434045607358
Weak wasting hand on mine.	308.6218281850366
They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.	269.7419487995529
Remembering thee, O Sion.	654.1415947311242
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	208.0951364007387
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of
seeds of brightness.	379.4958037487013
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,
am I?	378.4250307765443
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the
quaking soil.	342.9868559038736
Turn back.	60.304329750857036
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in
new sockets.	348.40786370000563
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	339.79754735245996
Through the
barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet
are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	396.33261133527935
In the darkness of the dome they wait,
their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
platters.	406.2092683811819
Who to clear it?	89.10842809216
He has the key.	107.27504354941198
I will not sleep there when
this night comes.	211.28195665170554
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind
bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	342.12951125565485
Call: no answer.	128.16092090950738
He lifted
his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	182.96295574637517
Take
all, keep all.	102.36239869681009
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	227.20438770441933
So in the moon’s
midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing
Elsinore’s tempting flood.	442.7866504148113
The flood is following me.	230.8820878286123
I can watch it flow past from here.	224.51060519016949
Get back
then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	145.2044850632261
He climbed over the sedge
and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
grike.	321.83102954322146
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	487.6922934747905
Before him the
gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	179.8087934248336
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot
called Gautier’s prose.	1343.0518672102025
These heavy sands are language tide and wind
have silted here.	448.12796150402863
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren
of weasel rats.	393.41924415784996
Hide gold there.	111.66835229160475
Try it.	30.60773084408939
You have some.	86.29966554608423
Sands and
stones.	88.86967299794622
Heavy of the past.	43.54468113504978
Sir Lout’s toys.	347.40293510774814
Mind you don’t get one bang
on the ear.	153.18109093807956
I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well
boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	397.9202001418635
I zmellz de bloodz
odz an Iridzman.	1188.912752724906
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	431.8526706324426
Lord, is he going to attack me?	122.83238922906091
Respect his liberty.	145.1147124854891
You will not be
master of others or their slave.	195.7904679262171
I have my stick.	140.42546874977148
Sit tight.	142.95329821161758
From
farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,
two.	538.8213398780728
The two maries.	314.3780190971523
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	386.21711321039896
I see you.	62.277614812888366
No, the dog.	59.69778570804098
He is running back to them.	118.26035210898982
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	476.38654177688727
Dane vikings,
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
collar of gold.	535.3985379933417
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	649.2541589852436
Then from the starving cagework
city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives,
running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	723.1269771125552
Famine, plague
and slaughters.	335.89977991827897
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	219.9370591354914
I moved
among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
spluttering resin fires.	459.9264700500132
I spoke to no-one: none to me.	133.32376554259508
The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	388.92591291711454
Dog of my enemy.	116.2918148500549
I
just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	524.5614455629407
A
primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear.	594.8073687050801
For that are you
pining, the bark of their applause?	193.47459648281742
Pretenders: live their lives.	233.97948816466757
All kings’ sons.	449.4513949186362
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	124.35447830837322
But the courtiers
who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	431.3466549397779
We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	296.51793171810925
Would you do what
he did?	81.60536170861529
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	279.6936456949833
_Natürlich_, put there for
you.	85.97509234173553
Would you or would you not?	83.20557248286282
The man that was drowned nine days ago
off Maiden’s rock.	320.77214159111395
They are waiting for him now.	124.81834591279232
The truth, spit it
out.	226.26330959334206
I would want to.	90.564846555325
I would try.	149.51474285406204
I am not a strong swimmer.	243.7725629035943
Water
cold soft.	223.5865663990666
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	210.64905972587465
Can’t
see! Who’s behind me?	178.65152965310767
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing
quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,
shellcocoacoloured?	387.30659966149517
If I had land under my feet.	283.7326936823012
I want his life still
to be his, mine to be mine.	139.45209963752558
A drowning man.	204.5807140096761
His human eyes scream to me
out of horror of his death.	176.8244457288387
With him together down...	127.83020890420141
I could not
save her.	139.6457687917968
Waters: bitter death: lost.	372.93813635354337
A woman and a man.	64.06788768561495
I see her skirties.	203.7082282987496
Pinned up, I bet.	340.09548027681495
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
all sides.	449.7019687677054
Looking for something lost in a past life.	133.38584354014392
Suddenly he made
off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
lowskimming gull.	358.4681144181302
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	449.32901283870535
He
turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	734.5044140736463
On a
field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	558.9183328918508
At the lacefringe of
the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	331.70208841869635
His snout
lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	593.2236051190649
They serpented
towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,
breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	711.5682298079513
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	292.6049533458479
The dog yelped
running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	472.25078893672435
Unheeded he kept by them
as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting
from his jaws.	275.02297310970704
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped
off at a calf’s gallop.	372.7394167960627
The carcass lay on his path.	282.05901606549224
He stopped,
sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,
sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.	472.04955671612487
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	304.4587550961949
Ah,
poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.	563.4754551998684
—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
	158.2198216355815
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	393.40977276797577
He
slunk back in a curve.	253.45511644960558
Doesn’t see me.	90.4250458657011
Along by the edge of the mole he
lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
against it.	284.21570853777956
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
quick short at an unsmelt rock.	551.2188589444022
The simple pleasures of the poor.	159.52342179259446
His
hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	504.459342826426
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	171.87198406515137
He rooted in the sand,
dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	307.78495695283954
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	204.75221978603162
Street of harlots.	120.44892091748781
Haroun al Raschid.	665.4413822859577
I am almosting it.	247.80045347436769
That
man led me, spoke.	235.61264742157016
I was not afraid.	116.97708705466351
The melon he had he held against
my face.	205.60917338234665
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	511.06980235886857
That was the rule, said.	89.19482994034023
Red carpet spread.	492.8828543375911
You will see who.	112.94717172526889
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	327.8303178377852
His blued feet
out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
strangling his unshaven neck.	667.0573603648445
With woman steps she followed: the
ruffian and his strolling mort.	308.23552108391186
Spoils slung at her back.	166.23779655178026
Loose sand
and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	451.55737085065056
About her windraw face hair
trailed.	483.59451379399354
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	445.4111470942633
When
night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an
archway where dogs have mired.	512.0359661201884
Her fancyman is treating two Royal
Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.	532.4651167351257
Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum
lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her
rancid rags.	1047.653715103065
Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	221.1726447418928
White thy fambles, red thy gan
	734.0689412841082
And thy quarrons dainty is.	440.080898267883
Couch a hogshead with me then.	138.3106118901409
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	257.34772259185274
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	1752.7770267937635
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	404.9075058057095
Call away let him: _thy quarrons
dainty is_.	730.3227971279667
Language no whit worse than his.	272.46050701518556
Monkwords, marybeads
jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their
pockets.	1006.0847226088714
Passing now.	56.330396450281164
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	265.50690459709847
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	503.63785103620967
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s
flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	214.45247238348404
She trudges,
schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	1684.904252676856
A tide westering,
moondrawn, in her wake.	531.1422403360455
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not
mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	663.110350624416
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	95.34784863315117
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	387.1510602499878
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	1034.7131336650125
He
comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying
the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	360.5964653253859
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	114.87792204474742
My tablets.	464.672675952932
Mouth to her kiss.	83.74043233216894
Must be two of em.	129.71382173404746
Glue em well.	238.80750364779607
Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	105.50670433592191
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	414.0193461496202
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	1019.6072641738801
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
wayawayawayawayaway.	1801.1187263559139
The banknotes, blast them.	530.9928759422826
Old Deasy’s
letter.	206.79886543350855
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	186.22638017197755
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
scribbled words.	146.94783376486345
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	261.6654841275409
Why not endless till
the farthest star?	394.6473918972962
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness
shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	331.5156806501166
Me sits there
with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth
stars.	447.05862648868157
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it
back.	435.6131066100189
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	161.87602931055773
Who watches me here?	221.36195222511012
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	415.5735114933429
Signs on a white
field.	113.85042025043685
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	200.72435106750174
The good bishop of
Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space
with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	315.3414344558519
Hold hard.	109.93699766835074
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,
flat I see, east, back.	557.2409915771448
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in
stereoscope.	433.45137477822595
Click does the trick.	127.93301049394705
You find my words dark.	215.2696071735159
Darkness is
in our souls do you not think?	141.98484506648506
Our souls, shamewounded by our
sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
more.	274.33203396044826
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	318.6194082185379
Now where the blue
hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	295.68845150975216
Into the ineluctable modality
of the ineluctable visuality.	265.1170303953297
What she?	39.93019424155908
The virgin at
Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet
books you were going to write.	269.2872155161834
Keen glance you gave her.	153.1290134424043
Wrist through
the braided jesse of her sunshade.	265.92085554323614
She lives in Leeson park with a
grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	245.13313722952142
Talk that to someone else,
Stevie: a pickmeup.	278.5933424627605
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders
and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	655.9746606436704
Talk about apple
dumplings, _piuttosto_.	795.2980090110547
Where are your wits?	205.4745496959779
Touch me.	43.12221257392657
Soft eyes.	62.2820201442977
Soft soft soft hand.	241.3537151280862
I am lonely here.	256.2342417359356
O, touch me
soon, now.	225.93842236181106
What is that word known to all men?	133.86991194925247
I am quiet here alone.	295.35869652118424
Sad too.	56.16717052284047
Touch, touch me.	125.83219202987355
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the
scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his
eyes.	304.44225483263386
That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap,
sabbath sleep.	571.4658120216708
_Et vidit Deus.	857.7253042844771
Et erant valde bona_.	1794.9662848377411
Alo! _Bonjour_.	203.15938669399281
Welcome as the flowers in May.	127.66529598779188
Under its leaf he watched through
peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	543.5155757566345
I am caught in this burning
scene.	305.1114440621908
Pan’s hour, the faunal noon.	256.10278673096406
Among gumheavy serpentplants,
milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	887.9583350266249
Pain is
far.	94.10788239991261
And no more turn aside and brood.	232.761205857312
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs,
_nebeneinander_.	468.20289008242247
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
another’s foot had nested warm.	536.1745828675994
The foot that beat the ground in
tripudium, foot I dislove.	454.33848752024846
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s
shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	378.8923556326439
_Tiens, quel petit pied!_
Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its
name.	517.4630073594524
His arm: Cranly’s arm.	294.28116628396623
He now will leave me.	163.09602545524845
And the blame?	88.8889558939125
As I
am.	264.3421356611983
All or not at all.	75.64428840644474
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	639.0599462125954
My ashplant will float
away.	389.8560171509638
I shall wait.	186.02760426011668
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
low rocks, swirling, passing.	408.36728530136907
Better get this job over quick.	244.18514611656207
Listen: a
fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	1610.1046808706603
Vehement breath of
waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	695.359812835976
In cups of rocks it
slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	751.8946095591506
And, spent, its speech
ceases.	646.8562984937299
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower
unfurling.	2051.4341800018437
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	662.5780335769707
Day by day: night by night:
lifted, flooded and let fall.	269.8800054245614
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
they sigh.	193.54557982887377
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
patiens ingemiscit_.	713.2251638801629
To no end gathered; vainly then released,
forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	590.3944626870305
Weary too in sight of
lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws
a toil of waters.	304.62522206254016
Five fathoms out there.	202.17790219486176
Full fathom five thy father lies.	559.5084195581094
At one, he
said.	55.81607043887532
Found drowned.	209.19524368391612
High water at Dublin bar.	312.00830829340265
Driving before it a
loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	422.9183328398426
A corpse
rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise
landward.	515.1344728559956
There he is.	39.38297654205718
Hook it quick.	97.30728668682944
We have him.	59.98881317165225
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	537.4272573509102
A quiver of minnows, fat of a
spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	458.60172026416586
God
becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
mountain.	1251.6002705534365
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
urinous offal from all dead.	880.0748675993766
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
the sun.	341.9436736151658
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	639.5589222345135
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
known to man.	262.74587020617076
Old Father Ocean.	494.0867752080217
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	476.1659450868231
Just you give it a fair trial.	159.61617010161294
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	930.6381194906928
I thirst.	236.72492112764175
Clouding over.	56.2025789643362
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	332.11250255603113
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	808.918016513619
My cockle hat and staff and
hismy sandal shoon.	761.6034244745624
To evening lands.	358.7965781835748
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
still.	277.07290139986713
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	210.84007727528535
All days make
their end.	216.8936885748035
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	176.5832140278796
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	417.8177778647212
Lawn
Tennyson, gentleman poet.	440.4692508594601
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	143.23777259850846
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	830.0711400059247
My teeth are very
bad.	232.32027367750885
Why, I wonder.	298.0420183677171
That one is going too.	112.25306129829663
Ought I go to
a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	257.69064824199137
That one.	47.004415340154765
Toothless Kinch,
the superman.	291.33908185109055
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	243.4585201824604
My handkerchief.	152.27515942925112
I remember.	104.03967789457202
Did I not take it up?	170.99299765508684
No, I didn’t.	263.1274696153266
Better buy one.	143.85049263539054
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
carefully.	352.66296119183505
For the rest let look who will.	145.36790980969604
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	305.1684395437693
Moving through the
air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	456.03986594537287
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	455.1294180746306
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes.	1485.4841858541417
Most of all he
liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
faintly scented urine.	424.90102641992394
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	250.5070320834435
Gelid light and air were in the
kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	238.6200356784598
Made him
feel a bit peckish.	197.33848807734933
The coals were reddening.	526.025555695803
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	244.74518038444054
She didn’t like
her plate full.	222.0728463377004
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	186.14181547423348
It sat there, dull and squat,
its spout stuck out.	407.63454219929923
Cup of tea soon.	140.8541396242136
Mouth dry.	156.73716971662776
The cat walked
stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	221.49069990323153
—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	213.74502995341658
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
table, mewing.	312.121429025659
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	319.94175242421875
Scratch
my head.	89.61103714482759
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	669.4665218359556
Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
tail, the green flashing eyes.	214.23556228298312
He bent down to her, his hands on his
knees.	131.2695657903677
—Milk for the pussens, he said.	85.31943639912097
—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	113.5445130685833
They call them stupid.	241.68366003983795
They understand what we say better than we
understand them.	259.77183669373693
She understands all she wants to.	185.59349508451197
Vindictive too.	56.16717052284047
Her nature.	108.19454961486083
Curious mice never squeal.	617.7735357802094
Seem to like it.	49.68555929803269
Wonder
what I look like to her.	141.227433733385
Height of a tower?	66.31194287349687
No, she can jump me.	189.1165455684397
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	123.78380604047807
Afraid of the
chookchooks.	82.87445786331675
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	284.3896768673561
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	128.95308002777853
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	449.7018598585488
He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	408.8225658477635
Then he went to
the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,
poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	257.92687974328396
—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	216.7552136240311
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
three times and licked lightly.	391.355987047725
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	179.68685584716667
Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	150.1026927114929
He listened to her licking lap.	310.0214976681577
Ham and eggs, no.	106.30995379468024
No good eggs with
this drouth.	257.7961359481125
Want pure fresh water.	343.7828951250984
Thursday: not a good day either for
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.	207.30867933341634
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	186.41578145643518
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.	230.12333742750292
While the kettle is boiling.	170.56353934619153
She
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	637.2743695348023
Why are their tongues so
rough?	288.71280978284784
To lap better, all porous holes.	591.4751930675676
Nothing she can eat?	151.05706722915681
He glanced
round him.	170.174930908511
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door.	245.7980635161552
She might like something tasty.	277.1664162920846
Thin bread and butter
she likes in the morning.	148.03064855264492
Still perhaps: once in a way.	113.28495211881751
He said softly in the bare hall:
	159.46857559024338
—I’m going round the corner.	130.94986446310511
Be back in a minute.	92.57576262933928
And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
	128.83660983428464
—You don’t want anything for breakfast?	221.313894540359
She didn’t want anything.	214.36288991889268
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	310.4236356024723
Must get those settled really.	324.5554261857527
All the way from Gibraltar.	119.16056476689529
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	252.037351202118
Wonder what her father gave for
it.	103.15453741293281
Old style.	177.74687135640693
Ah yes! of course.	74.19232429203451
Got a short knock.	158.97633558962386
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	252.62356128360724
Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
At
Plevna that was.	116.39089919205679
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.	203.28292315404917
Still
he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	184.1917435863501
Now that was
farseeing.	141.35414988409204
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	371.08028596943535
Stamps: stickyback
pictures.	836.1611188360959
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	198.12912568826377
Course they do.	72.04379292978177
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s
high grade ha.	331.9851324358138
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	501.9145079834709
White
slip of paper.	151.45678762759263
Quite safe.	177.75280258656545
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	172.8718985053985
Not there.	45.93688314776555
In the trousers I left off.	209.95696061331412
Must get it.	67.28293194430722
Potato I have.	188.68260340478528
Creaky
wardrobe.	365.4416887200119
No use disturbing her.	321.3260416133324
She turned over sleepily that time.	225.03233638946895
He
pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf
dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	337.57026009452886
Looked shut.	141.33324443389483
All right
till I come back anyhow.	343.11184387195436
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
seventyfive.	346.53539751719586
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.	258.1823686367176
Be a
warm day I fancy.	298.16265909551294
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	200.3272752161726
Black
conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	414.0088316761004
But I couldn’t go in
that light suit.	255.26533219365137
Make a picnic of it.	74.5433749620923
His eyelids sank quietly often as
he walked in happy warmth.	418.0522600576292
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our
daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	797.1538639547056
Makes you feel young.	124.22298626477722
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn.	268.7333084636547
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.	141.39720112443138
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	261.9604881683813
Wander through awned streets.	557.3102761791174
Turbaned faces going by.	167.57833640787362
Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
a coiled pipe.	702.9309133597128
Cries of sellers in the streets.	135.25562425014414
Drink water scented
with fennel, sherbet.	648.0581167871645
Dander along all day.	127.06110604186533
Might meet a robber or two.	191.5923972142506
Well, meet him.	113.24970314649109
Getting on to sundown.	119.57241219065106
The shadows of the mosques among
the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	279.09848542795095
A shiver of the trees,
signal, the evening wind.	229.59391253718044
I pass on.	103.05260944196311
Fading gold sky.	261.0328555544098
A mother watches
me from her doorway.	240.1420554531558
She calls her children home in their dark
language.	235.9637460897653
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	761.8008828995653
Night sky, moon, violet,
colour of Molly’s new garters.	470.1487069580291
A girl playing one of
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	276.63556445738226
I pass.	120.5901534203396
Probably not a bit like it really.	112.03845189268982
Kind of stuff you read: in the track
of the sun.	102.41750672048838
Sunburst on the titlepage.	101.61753306187707
He smiled, pleasing himself.	442.2841688284014
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_
leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway
behind the bank of Ireland.	298.14656634269215
He prolonged his pleased smile.	362.1880139774015
Ikey touch
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	248.54081227017718
From the cellar grating floated up the
flabby gush of porter.	410.23012867060277
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	470.6522890310904
Good house, however: just the
end of the city traffic.	175.26490074035777
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n.	416.33724016736613
as
position.	151.1157688453307
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular
from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	249.48305640974579
Baldhead over the blind.	83.79221066578664
Cute old codger.	298.2276727372766
No use canvassing him for an
ad.	268.4398324841961
Still he knows his own business best.	171.71859535802108
There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	413.0553289172071
Simon Dedalus takes him
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	221.6278273994153
Do you know what I’m going to
tell you?	160.50577828841412
What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?	332.5722220744433
Do you know what?	74.299778764485
The Russians,
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.	300.8485793764843
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	121.47264343602338
Sad thing about poor
Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.	649.2115392108972
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
doorway:
	249.74612724778547
—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.	649.6597886778891
—Good day to you.	61.62546942677623
—Lovely weather, sir.	222.67301718014312
—’Tis all that.	44.88691634937598
Where do they get the money?	103.38519788057648
Coming up redheaded curates from the
county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	375.52368316934235
Then, lo and
behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	538.5668287409908
Then think
of the competition.	106.44797182419381
General thirst.	236.72492112764175
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
without passing a pub.	464.46105249491484
Save it they can’t.	87.96371644710636
Off the drunks perhaps.	169.82407019245366
Put
down three and carry five.	191.14918952072858
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs
and drabs.	162.3502826950497
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	282.33827644711306
Doing a double shuffle with
the town travellers.	269.79197645812206
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the
job, see?	135.54924130661644
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	149.35458769921792
Say ten barrels
of stuff.	253.95149150627483
Say he got ten per cent off.	275.57820792245104
He passed Saint
Joseph’s National school.	559.6219470517067
Brats’ clamour.	317.5334699131929
Windows open.	91.68388695368711
Fresh air helps
memory.	505.41752798382765
Or a lilt.	133.80256037937727
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee
doubleyou.	2813.823693529511
Boys are they?	69.07460521413789
At
their joggerfry.	272.94220147700804
Slieve Bloom.	203.15938669399281
He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white.	353.57924928183144
Fifteen multiplied by.	206.25937632811844
The figures whitened
in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	456.2465293475769
The shiny links,
packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.	587.2682126761592
He
stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	168.84006011271669
Would she buy it too,
calling the items from a slip in her hand?	182.80454955709249
Chapped: washingsoda.	464.672675952932
And a
pound and a half of Denny’s sausages.	152.77210857540933
Woods his name is.	70.1743717038041
Wonder what he does.	81.30056408126866
Wife is oldish.	231.8834496265408
New
blood.	118.1399304740844
No followers allowed.	871.6528860543791
Whacking a carpet on
the clothesline.	154.12978001328005
She does whack it, by George.	293.1224595364073
The way her crooked
skirt swings at each whack.	462.6562366562489
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	614.9112973566722
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	337.33192080417626
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	260.9112121948638
Can become ideal winter
sanatorium.	1243.1696083954666
Moses Montefiore.	203.15938669399281
I thought he was.	70.69387680602036
Farmhouse, wall round
it, blurred cattle cropping.	503.24035369921427
He held the page from him: interesting:
read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
rustling.	330.2712693252764
A young white heifer.	329.3189113032757
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a
palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled
switches in their hands.	442.6980405669757
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his
senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	349.57791146983544
The crooked skirt
swinging, whack by whack by whack.	670.5287249020575
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
sausages and made a red grimace.	443.2809126547286
—Now, my miss, he said.	85.31334752751572
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	537.218774243101
—Thank you, my miss.	93.86356955310349
And one shilling threepence change.	435.0077017786972
For you,
please?	99.046562131297
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	544.0394529603353
To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams.	285.41549802807276
Pleasant to see first thing in the
morning.	89.58503749708146
Hurry up, damn it.	110.20505377229539
Make hay while the sun shines.	298.97493378761664
She stood
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	226.16782077930142
He
sighed down his nose: they never understand.	245.63054906504846
Sodachapped hands.	80.88122368589796
Crusted
toenails too.	282.23259047130705
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	630.2699047432585
The
sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	498.26389401104944
For
another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane.	405.30522741329537
They like
them sizeable.	211.42190260714585
Prime sausage.	317.5334699131929
O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the
wood.	394.352752957366
—Threepence, please.	121.44283619207401
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	337.6431932833181
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them
on the rubber prickles.	274.6111513037154
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
disc by disc, into the till.	340.5227492238277
—Thank you, sir.	72.41070659050347
Another time.	59.26338156361836
He withdrew his gaze
after an instant.	291.33984310371807
No: better not: another time.	166.06468461657832
—Good morning, he said, moving away.	169.56010562866535
—Good morning, sir.	142.47583933994568
No sign.	141.33324443389483
What matter?	109.92966212600332
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	479.02557926248227
Agendath Netaim:
planters’ company.	790.3039290664447
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	839.2437669447909
Excellent for shade, fuel
and construction.	330.12366179258794
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	349.52211367873093
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with
olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	439.7868133182936
Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation.	1374.9795277880883
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	150.24722733920163
Can pay ten
down and the balance in yearly instalments.	283.92876723120617
Bleibtreustrasse 34,
Berlin, W.	770.5244035147354
Nothing doing.	115.14811726040057
Still an idea behind it.	145.00660504162758
Silverpowdered
olivetrees.	464.672675952932
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	623.5875249781043
Olives are packed in
jars, eh?	362.0103377899957
I have a few left from Andrews.	177.77220181439583
Knows the taste of them now.	89.80525318053284
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	362.8428855142077
Citrons too.	56.16717052284047
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade.	359.4078813552993
And
Mastiansky with the old cither.	192.70553925714236
Pleasant evenings we had then.	192.86532957560127
Molly in
Citron’s basketchair.	249.1496546113693
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,
lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	219.94337760868746
Like that, heavy, sweet,
wild perfume.	335.04536966626773
Always the same, year after year.	146.54129651263318
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant
old times.	401.54196768304513
Must be without a flaw, he said.	128.2511621611374
Coming all that way: Spain,
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	321.7655508914908
Crates lined up on the quayside
at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them
barefoot in soiled dungarees.	461.8249745530462
There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	118.71632873197281
How do
you?	60.930362284952714
Doesn’t see.	79.98659343147196
His back
is like that Norwegian captain’s.	181.88912798870732
Wonder if I’ll meet him today.	298.46451727346596
Watering cart.	216.9643641122702
To provoke the rain.	256.8742841653224
On earth as it is in heaven.	118.64051623083094
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	339.479784242906
No, not like that.	64.77101331921281
No wind could lift
those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	867.4584303575202
Brimstone they called
it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	317.40260949035957
All
dead names.	228.41250941911017
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	161.27315173035566
Old now.	56.330396450281164
It bore
the oldest, the first race.	192.16548269727537
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s,
clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	398.83860695236643
The oldest people.	420.68475525621733
Wandered far
away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,
being born everywhere.	446.3864294626448
It lay there now.	139.9714820438288
Now it could bear no more.	163.50862540253078
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	170.10258970692686
Grey horror seared his flesh.	480.6087892268229
Folding the page into his pocket he
turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	320.6521644920442
Cold oils slid along his
veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	556.7926738254577
Well, I
am here now.	260.7394936021962
Yes, I am here now.	260.7394936021962
Got up wrong
side of the bed.	118.90741951889767
Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises.	419.5901060617506
On the
hands down.	71.58610455987798
Blotchy brown brick houses.	574.8242686789242
Number eighty still unlet.	674.0273352233489
Why
is that?	43.8437134325822
Valuation is only twentyeight.	191.52370635024903
Towers, Battersby, North,
MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	1009.654636435726
Plasters on a sore
eye.	136.40661552184716
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling
butter.	325.8408164184041
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	514.5209142463793
Yes, yes.	60.45787357664621
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath.	674.9919289475549
Runs, she runs to meet me, a
girl with gold hair on the wind.	156.56235888291673
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	167.45109280228746
He stooped and gathered
them.	253.0438941428911
Mrs Marion Bloom.	494.0867752080217
His quickened heart slowed at once.	557.8509874378442
Bold hand.	63.94292681056337
Mrs Marion.	203.15938669399281
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	321.79825045986337
—Who are the letters for?	83.33459616655287
He looked at them.	109.26805541789298
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	141.65507452756265
And
a letter for you.	71.73874745091821
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of
her knees.	244.26515630201303
—Do you want the blind up?	100.82632240427954
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	297.4529490218171
—That do?	55.71292897014647
he asked, turning.	166.9720350319153
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	217.53017603272588
—She got the things, she said.	94.87642149375058
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
slowly with a snug sigh.	320.4149203604807
—Hurry up with that tea, she said.	96.88168202038014
I’m parched.	306.7521064276188
—The kettle is boiling, he said.	190.5387289210895
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	241.65700558664327
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
	172.07503764207163
—Scald the teapot.	82.94428793571605
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	254.44906321213674
He scalded
and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting
the kettle then to let the water flow in.	258.4452481806854
Having set it to draw he took
off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the
lump of butter slide and melt.	264.6766083503717
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat
mewed hungrily against him.	294.0335185889791
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.	272.72534968062416
Say
they won’t eat pork.	288.3880172389992
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall
to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	307.5743157087566
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	383.8194101913557
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	205.66538034654775
Thanks:
new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s
seaside girls.	1162.0238608451825
The tea was drawn.	192.8394424031549
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,
smiling.	703.1427972746767
Silly Milly’s birthday gift.	441.5334862242873
Only five she was then.	107.00565274753039
No, wait:
four.	172.58376223855004
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	298.3502896733451
Putting pieces of
folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	206.21534789238027
He smiled, pouring.	346.99370988120415
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	322.5152058379339
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	187.67733082141956
I’d rather have you without a farthing
	206.3657426868288
Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	310.93590478060855
Poor old professor Goodwin.	281.8434469761773
Dreadful old case.	128.14026577026405
Still he was a courteous
old chap.	142.92262952031902
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	237.6422517265229
And
the little mirror in his silk hat.	128.47139076083516
The night Milly brought it into the
parlour.	227.19582736941854
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we
laughed.	378.3283658291382
Sex breaking out even then.	209.55989400627874
Pert little piece she was.	137.11403155003998
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray.	246.63938935730908
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	236.62815645326336
Everything on it?	41.19414861010892
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	359.3915102292438
He carried it
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	343.8350743331334
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it
on the chair by the bedhead.	140.26155809527174
—What a time you were! she said.	79.84579924018634
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large
soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.	429.3972266208197
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	505.0062986789543
In the
act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	186.40546668903394
—Who was the letter from?	68.37237094681906
he asked.	66.98244490415372
Bold hand.	63.94292681056337
—O, Boylan, she said.	149.09578445758024
He’s bringing the programme.	150.52139671605812
—What are you singing?	124.89095920396852
—_Là ci darem_ with J.	641.5534269261972
Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.	307.97646263701256
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	389.01602587471046
Rather stale smell that incense leaves
next day.	478.67960448031664
Like foul flowerwater.	687.5437617162512
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
	257.6479792431876
—What time is the funeral?	91.45065666853394
—Eleven, I think, he answered.	236.95108205164368
I didn’t see the paper.	125.49727374575752
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
drawers from the bed.	151.00551747989095
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	744.8010635613277
—No: that book.	83.76338073484109
Other stocking.	249.71993668557914
Her petticoat.	181.77649227523645
—It must have fell down, she said.	151.98801782031333
He felt here and there.	110.68724950308152
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	530.9735875945828
Wonder if she pronounces
that right: _voglio_.	293.201305753448
Not in the bed.	47.64202753831987
Must have slid down.	189.77663694104308
He stooped
and lifted the valance.	251.02157295578033
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
the orangekeyed chamberpot.	406.91098278389927
—Show here, she said.	84.04217517249117
I put a mark in it.	96.41842603697253
There’s a word I wanted to
ask you.	163.76291152464418
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	306.5336944976906
—Met him what?	55.736202548584494
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—Here, she said.	55.29788464652819
What does that mean?	140.49165480822938
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	477.3328134727571
Who’s he when he’s at home?	76.48082820870742
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	110.20555237145946
It’s Greek: from the Greek.	160.24134349514048
That
means the transmigration of souls.	195.76696295153096
Tell us in plain words.	172.13229396615063
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	439.049794158706
The same young eyes.	160.55925673484612
The first night after the charades.	165.3020603895791
Dolphin’s Barn.	136.70385447397808
He turned over the
smudged pages.	258.9272277391098
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	103.53776113412566
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	370.7704454983778
Must be Ruby pride of the on the
floor naked.	165.9037059366347
Sheet kindly lent.	443.7052612075001
Cruelty behind it all.	82.70573811913593
Doped
animals.	177.75576849003383
Trapeze at Hengler’s.	128.0794119492292
Had to look the other way.	78.90217095219766
Mob gaping.	202.40812122271268
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides.	260.3969614153912
Families of them.	39.85593310847087
Bone them
young so they metamspychosis.	224.7838350975018
Our souls.	152.27261904360242
That
a man’s soul after he dies.	140.62299186996276
Dignam’s soul...	88.48117325163018
—Did you finish it?	119.72405219719329
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—Yes, she said.	55.29788464652819
There’s nothing smutty in it.	132.92778158010094
Is she in love with the
first fellow all the time?	85.23208874316258
—Never read it.	80.15494447142594
Do you want another?	125.20157034079469
Get another of Paul de Kock’s.	265.1554291639441
Nice name he has.	88.28890899022372
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	400.88131985193917
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to
Kearney, my guarantor.	421.03633307795934
Reincarnation: that’s the word.	54.85310482721533
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
after death, that we lived before.	216.6337616444207
They call it reincarnation.	224.52775523164786
That we
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
planet.	239.29801363016014
They say we have forgotten it.	153.23366677171057
Some say they remember their
past lives.	250.64465402593814
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	948.9699515946747
Better
remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	153.9575427811021
An example would be better.	205.65036989167876
An
example?	152.27515942925112
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	138.26782777254297
Given away with the Easter number
of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	431.3041284953852
Tea before you
put milk in.	133.53893291557313
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	283.01198919145577
Three and six
I gave for the frame.	205.7704792894135
She said it would look nice over the bed.	134.63181688986097
Naked
nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	216.89505193153744
He turned the pages back.	137.77978375917633
—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	136.82870656902392
They
used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
instance.	227.5287669767993
What they called nymphs, for example.	268.3062328966229
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	305.6391760094283
She gazed straight before her,
inhaling through her arched nostrils.	510.59808557108136
—There’s a smell of burn, she said.	116.27182175232552
Did you leave anything on the fire?	134.359355454475
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.	241.65192800587272
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs.	409.3213675850122
Pungent smoke
shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	224.6697309473401
By prodding a prong of
the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its
back.	225.65297095429474
Only a little burnt.	147.60095391727072
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and
let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	236.6728166441803
Cup of tea now.	90.51806416956346
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	201.718910234706
He
shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	194.96060946618397
Then he put a
forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
meat.	368.77915687662846
Done to a turn.	62.71148714490919
A mouthful of tea.	259.4349626856147
What was that
about some young student and a picnic?	147.50375950259402
He creased out the letter at his
side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in
the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	217.71207479476718
Dearest Papli
	203.15938669399281
Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	225.28293209727255
It suits me
splendid.	341.84078795100993
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	307.35766761752785
I got
mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing.	336.0551008409545
They are lovely.	125.8284126576827
I am
getting on swimming in the photo business now.	234.18191368559465
Mr Coghlan took one of
me and Mrs.	180.64500188726933
Will send when developed.	354.7045326734371
We did great biz yesterday.	441.0816887983609
Fair
day and all the beef to the heels were in.	94.27125720664012
We are going to lough Owel
on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	294.5869121415045
Give my love to
mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	173.8756594171237
I hear them at the piano
downstairs.	192.55805825562376
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	166.7603039312062
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the
pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls.	383.6493174891752
Tell
him silly Milly sends my best respects.	565.231270510944
I must now close with fondest
love
	309.8087290981323
Your fond daughter
	350.7654919173598
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	284.65410050442057
Fifteen yesterday.	164.52153759044862
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	171.4095141225116
Her first
birthday away from home.	273.34348997715756
Remember the summer morning she
was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	289.58464619453446
Jolly
old woman.	100.38604478191462
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	182.3430957849569
She knew
from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live.	246.78223097977238
Well, God is good, sir.	209.47400823099204
She knew at once.	142.81711647716315
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	176.38515633986253
Excuse bad writing.	239.3551870960983
Piano downstairs.	266.003957838601
Coming out of her shell.	99.01001407960544
Row with her in the
XL Café about the bracelet.	156.28984957820512
Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.	241.52757479342085
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece
after piece of kidney.	301.2695984877185
Twelve and six a week.	107.39617461608158
Not much.	79.33166529084998
Still, she
might do worse.	180.8127804588203
Music hall stage.	313.675361919753
Young student.	161.75487270836388
He drank a draught of
cooler tea to wash down his meal.	303.60751653441
Then he read the letter again: twice.	146.72212435900673
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	205.59070572536962
No, nothing has
happened.	261.9236837933111
Of course it might.	114.31685944186958
Wait in any case till it does.	156.4661213357688
A wild
piece of goods.	292.6626195066504
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	300.4481569077487
Ripening now.	56.330396450281164
Vain: very.	70.89066596399199
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	298.4635930444553
Day I caught
her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	228.96244204104005
Anemic a
little.	50.14595328182757
Was given milk too long.	258.26605097592034
On the _Erin’s King_ that day round
the Kish.	187.9199457268198
Damned old tub pitching about.	460.37885472822086
Not a bit funky.	179.4399086874769
Her pale blue
scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	228.82650663209202
All dimpled cheeks and curls,
	481.6198704772034
Your head it simply swirls.	250.15459800448352
Seaside girls.	123.25150931121024
Torn envelope.	167.4639897228291
Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets,
jarvey off for the day, singing.	218.5322350638496
Friend of the family.	52.44000334561266
Swurls, he says.	51.67736732027447
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	467.32607010474504
Those girls, those girls,
	251.50604265254958
Those lovely seaside girls.	372.4680772294899
Milly too.	56.16717052284047
Young kisses: the first.	119.04917277887397
Far away now past.	168.55894232691136
Mrs Marion.	203.15938669399281
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
braiding.	373.5557000425655
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	837.4833453184792
Will
happen, yes.	229.9435598701843
Useless: can’t move.	191.25361457527183
Girl’s sweet light lips.	191.0070848228791
Will happen too.	218.96199656374282
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	338.05666291157945
Useless to
move now.	122.10992449810323
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	549.599416174473
Full gluey woman’s lips.	315.63227708462153
Better where she is down there: away.	127.47449666092582
Occupy her.	34.64317786172705
Wanted a dog to pass
the time.	92.38050046622116
Might take a trip down there.	181.70754690686442
August bank holiday, only two
and six return.	351.22955684681966
Six weeks off, however.	298.56323232934864
Might work a press pass.	209.75347581092058
Or
through M’Coy.	447.6244533525999
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door.	295.6240539417069
She looked back at him, mewing.	214.77027086703043
Wants to go out.	69.2389850335822
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	205.002785163994
Has the fidgets.	104.80482517530956
Thunder in the air.	44.602231448042986
Was washing at her
ear with her back to the fire too.	137.12309001127252
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	297.2447241611675
He stood
up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	208.61639293766257
The cat mewed to him.	192.94754167998255
—Miaow! he said in answer.	75.24072189203282
Wait till I’m ready.	399.7073663023352
Heaviness: hot day coming.	223.53871638602575
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
landing.	183.9308530818483
A paper.	98.03816495330732
He liked to read at stool.	233.68719803850576
Hope no ape comes knocking just as
I’m.	440.7702067080622
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	216.44642442519927
He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	153.51746561687094
The cat went up in
soft bounds.	281.9552820577727
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	188.33681560862976
Listening, he heard her voice:
	101.43539547010394
—Come, come, pussy.	313.3378565777129
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
towards the next garden.	223.4491586361693
No sound.	150.21429608575608
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	254.19280806773438
Fine morning.	89.69348729814052
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	315.9617478595515
Make a summerhouse here.	177.30465733656305
Virginia creepers.	464.672675952932
Want to
manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	349.247495219993
A coat of liver of sulphur.	230.29524900110474
All soil like that without dung.	283.5176596241341
Household slops.	266.01283497161296
Loam, what is this
that is?	76.71360785825345
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
dressing.	385.5676928411042
Mulch of dung.	103.46621991707202
Best thing to clean ladies’ kid
gloves.	395.76518963367346
Dirty cleans.	464.672675952932
Ashes too.	56.16717052284047
Reclaim the whole place.	93.53211219519288
Grow peas in
that corner there.	171.32118352320484
Always have fresh greens then.	308.5030602065621
Still
gardens have their drawbacks.	372.60474186494065
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	527.0074990879631
He walked on.	92.71568396539735
Where is my hat, by the way?	88.13372203725497
Must have put it back on the
peg.	128.13073323896276
Or hanging up on the floor.	120.00607921300806
Funny I don’t remember that.	214.31916970343775
Hallstand
too full.	120.93308605587835
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	483.2508134707418
Picking up the letters.	78.22536676196673
Drago’s shopbell ringing.	385.33053712711904
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	232.85568583816175
Brown
brillantined hair over his collar.	325.13162249978996
Just had a wash and brushup.	161.44740217014828
Wonder
have I time for a bath this morning.	204.6705811846989
Tara street.	64.81816915559368
Chap in the paybox
there got away James Stephens, they say.	267.46067500551726
O’Brien.	203.15938669399281
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	228.84061700769928
Agendath what is it?	57.78703597408876
Now, my miss.	100.9637858582891
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	226.60673042665837
Better be careful not to
get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	216.4622200101659
He went in, bowing his head
under the low lintel.	233.5430879828072
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	416.9125681644835
Before sitting down he
peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	262.552286037019
The king was in his
countinghouse.	144.06367926440075
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
on his bared knees.	255.78748210595793
Something new and easy.	130.12137255212423
No great hurry.	255.64361701326953
Keep it a
bit.	57.31021360452876
Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_.	641.446302147319
Written by Mr Philip
Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London.	991.8864649695371
Payment at the rate of one guinea a
column has been made to the writer.	173.99010953682478
Three and a half.	51.59064671410519
Three pounds
three.	200.9133595945146
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	264.8888454860147
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding
but resisting, began the second.	304.1522543486098
Midway, his last resistance yielding,
he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading
still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	476.1637385260317
Hope
it’s not too big bring on piles again.	199.9018674536111
No, just right.	116.74447268045795
Ah! Costive.	203.15938669399281
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	761.508309620863
Life might be so.	108.7176965335078
It did not move or
touch him but it was something quick and neat.	203.55600931472637
Print anything now.	128.87167895252333
Silly season.	249.72410360095353
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	378.2927248843794
Neat
certainly.	136.88480752603797
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won
the laughing witch who now_.	251.4674626234504
Begins and ends morally.	274.7245507744551
_Hand in hand_.	159.69432565226947
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his
water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	357.4337108717748
Might manage a sketch.	385.57878642629777
By Mr and Mrs L.	408.26256885177355
Invent a story for
some proverb.	204.30109141502015
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what
she said dressing.	339.45071208679053
Dislike dressing together.	315.2247099172567
Nicked myself shaving.	365.50802225334445
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	354.15387112328943
Timing her.	34.64317786172705
9.15.	203.15938669399281
Did Roberts pay you yet?	302.3602563078165
9.20.	203.15938669399281
What had Gretta Conroy on?	266.07927557341327
9.23.	203.15938669399281
What possessed me to buy this comb?	289.35366271768066
9.24.	203.15938669399281
I’m swelled after that
cabbage.	300.1086725676024
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	239.93838542294253
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	564.2166040126674
Morning
after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the
hours.	296.17698415958625
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
night hours.	312.98405921075357
Washing her teeth.	106.08776438403746
That was the first night.	70.12395001269105
Her head
dancing.	211.1264988300072
Her fansticks clicking.	1247.7144807542668
Is that Boylan well off?	182.64308153270227
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	235.19931916680733
No use
humming then.	325.633357830753
Allude to it.	33.80577129382775
Strange kind of music that last night.	145.808458658129
The
mirror was in shadow.	140.62014337882232
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
vest against her full wagging bub.	669.2207791713697
Peering into it.	63.52880070300117
Lines in her eyes.	58.81829461145087
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.	351.682131341732
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	371.3518089672422
Night hours then: black with
daggers and eyemasks.	324.6090352619949
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then
black.	358.77215210853603
Still, true to life also.	167.28125075747445
Day: then the night.	61.640155962928276
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	306.1270972889565
He pulled
back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
into the air.	221.84146120148043
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully
his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	259.50757916348016
What
time is the funeral?	91.45065666853394
Better find out in the paper.	92.17771273575977
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	182.62059139907134
The bells of George’s
church.	224.03219095191204
Heigho! Heigho!
	203.15938669399281
Heigho! Heigho!
	203.15938669399281
Heigho! Heigho!
	203.15938669399281
Quarter to.	24.19661115716355
A
third.	144.65005761125022
Poor Dignam!
	203.15938669399281
By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph
office.	902.1757099269324
Could have given that address too.	192.2242361383572
And past the sailors’ home.	194.96858430839117
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
Lime street.	213.6671063055804
By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	480.6436190605703
A smaller girl with scars of
eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered
caskhoop.	555.6461656084944
Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.	200.48234939365804
O let him! His life
isn’t such a bed of roses.	259.4053856030195
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	523.4856017688969
Come
home to ma, da.	319.2881390331061
Slack hour: won’t be many there.	219.7305240662565
He crossed Townsend
street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	337.2363570200382
El, yes: house of: Aleph,
Beth.	271.00192179607205
And past Nichols’ the undertaker.	339.262011180963
At eleven it is.	101.42228426665193
Time enough.	106.56447059563713
Singing with his
eyes shut.	105.30808667885502
Met her once in the park.	89.47814499081937
In the dark.	48.7055545578141
What a lark.	118.85859117462238
Police tout.	287.40150812754337
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom
tooraloom tay.	272.5446254868028
O, surely he bagged it.	232.6049233038284
Bury him cheap in a
whatyoumaycall.	166.20545776602586
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	433.3663468257439
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
finest quality, family tea.	489.6510005205961
Rather warm.	118.1379595617895
Must get some from Tom
Kernan.	331.2643450432834
Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though.	155.941443688478
While his eyes still
read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	270.1608661534992
Very warm
morning.	199.13443583643107
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the
leather headband inside his high grade ha.	359.16234223494297
Just there.	45.93688314776555
So warm.	118.1379595617895
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
hair.	226.6498421326525
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	307.86717086574987
The far east.	281.37402694159124
Lovely spot it
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	407.788726390743
Wonder is it like
that.	60.97278429016524
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
not doing a hand’s turn all day.	277.0245510225252
Sleep six months out of twelve.	221.04924665998223
Too
hot to quarrel.	221.3642591292352
Influence of the climate.	76.70738238296035
Flowers of
idleness.	155.25731673228717
The air feeds most.	426.4003822390561
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	270.3610181390642
Sensitive plants.	249.71993668557914
Petals too tired to.	122.63351306299194
Sleeping sickness
in the air.	123.07890709814986
Walk on roseleaves.	212.4637543754737
Imagine trying to eat tripe and
cowheel.	358.93917300759426
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	192.87355365911046
Ah yes, in
the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	185.44491233489725
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	308.7785597701946
Because the weight of
the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the
weight of the what?	88.32804548506921
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	124.54999074184859
It’s a
law something like that.	99.43206327093019
Vance in High school cracking his
fingerjoints, teaching.	581.5508533043558
The college curriculum.	538.0765777929911
Cracking curriculum.	365.4355909322164
What is weight really when you say the weight?	186.7781636532535
Thirtytwo feet per
second per second.	383.481422352021
They
all fall to the ground.	100.18708843353286
The earth.	107.62788236886628
It’s the force of gravity of the
earth is the weight.	106.69258754317651
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	215.78712976321162
How did she walk with her
sausages?	175.88537509785286
Like that something.	71.47590320744075
As he walked he took the folded
_Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a
baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	311.40331288434726
Careless air: just drop in to see.	148.1435882917395
Per second per second.	265.6092179751997
Per second
for every second it means.	202.470484889437
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance
through the door of the postoffice.	182.53287147876486
Too late box.	304.7407676849582
Post here.	64.56289892777333
No-one.	47.004415340154765
He handed the card through the brass grill.	258.8628104484149
—Are there any letters for me?	142.58685107541612
he asked.	66.98244490415372
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	349.6682419230885
No answer
probably.	260.8205373664343
Went too far last time.	178.78653649347473
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
letter.	238.10461357258256
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	309.62897174514904
Henry Flower Esq,
c/o P.	583.8371987831097
Answered anyhow.	121.44081115263944
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	364.4972766013282
Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?	232.99325766220934
Castoff soldier.	202.40812122271268
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	691.226824742748
No, he’s a
grenadier.	96.82290270409436
Pointed cuffs.	287.3919172316162
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	312.4432039385801
Too showy.	464.672675952932
That must be why the women go after them.	147.25989784476755
Easier to enlist and drill.	239.64388494482301
Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off

paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:
overseas or halfseasover empire.	443.2398169421513

A mason, yes.	263.3914802402731
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	111.93330972115342
Talk: as if
that would mend matters.	248.7608291284575
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	226.18250201927884
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think.	293.2794024628426
His fingers drew forth the
letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	179.5383011676748
Something
pinned on: photo perhaps.	346.34061793718115
M’Coy.	203.15938669399281
Get rid of him quickly.	169.8060750523595
Take me out of my way.	81.74097620753432
Hate company when
you.	119.93972649407601
—Hello, Bloom.	203.15938669399281
Where are you off to?	72.9556468074812
—Hello, M’Coy.	494.0867752080217
Nowhere in particular.	95.16029096963999
—How’s the body?	58.32318465347845
—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.	630.4907325576773
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
	198.28762912475122
—Is there any...	90.48517016561881
no trouble I hope?	448.99898689334543
I see you’re...	98.16675708120583
—O, no, Mr Bloom said.	293.54707579777823
Poor Dignam, you know.	164.08675430465942
The funeral is today.	191.97339659273362
—To be sure, poor fellow.	184.24478068846557
So it is.	44.17687065229445
What time?	59.26338156361836
A photo it isn’t.	212.8217872770446
A badge maybe.	563.7970672332062
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	658.7266167394479
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said.	251.02236809855907
Eleven, is it?	44.73630436839303
I only heard
it last night.	167.13871037889336
Who was telling me?	105.4715827288251
You know Hoppy?	224.9354653021633
—I know.	62.35918204518505
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
of the Grosvenor.	214.83596361002589
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	192.32648977757756
She
stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
searched his pockets for change.	284.54418399883957
Stylish kind of coat with that roll
collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	266.5257177188454
Careless
stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	181.40018385926274
Like that haughty
creature at the polo match.	325.75780406961655
Women all for caste till you touch the
spot.	204.47377926226633
Handsome is and handsome does.	135.4218032933562
Reserved about to yield.	157.02280497750135
The
honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	315.197260425095
Possess her once take
the starch out of her.	126.5151998271444
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do
you call him Bantam Lyons.	210.80208535328083
Just down there in Conway’s we were.	139.34346801285562
Doran Lyons in Conway’s.	198.68790333723064
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	182.56612243834311
In came
Hoppy.	253.05443754653265
Having a wet.	85.67619032218073
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
braided drums.	336.80330712886297
Clearly I can see today.	293.2000203279979
Moisture about gives long sight
perhaps.	330.2057572729769
Talking of one thing or another.	106.68116174500132
Lady’s hand.	62.29840051948999
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
said.	388.02662774747245
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	232.80574965000716
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	176.62267823383237
High brown boots with laces
dangling.	458.1281552105107
What is he foostering over that change for?	160.18060528805563
Sees me looking.	101.9132517725103
Eye out for other fellow always.	142.40742777226706
Good fallback.	464.672675952932
Two
strings to her bow.	203.26240624112341
—_Why?_ I said.	130.32923168208634
_What’s wrong with him?_ I said.	135.95936751230155
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	426.82466439686215
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head.	185.31268553416322
Getting up in a
minute.	82.3676001663895
—_What’s wrong with him_?	208.75104866096848
He said.	39.3877482893773
_He’s dead_, he said.	128.12675041927983
And, faith, he
filled up.	193.00817839498194
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	299.873304196622
I said.	39.3877482893773
I couldn’t believe it when I
heard it.	234.39618247056254
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it
in the Arch.	192.3614665775092
_Yes,_ he said.	44.11933153641297
_He’s gone.	81.13213681790569
He died on Monday, poor
fellow_.	487.18052548116503
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	850.0440302122345
A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	1144.7902708392223
Lost it.	30.60773084408939
Curse your noisy pugnose.	507.3491091419604
Feels locked out of it.	99.11283716779647
Paradise and
the peri.	85.91442993444174
The very moment.	149.34143089758163
Girl in Eustace
street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	382.8832159690923
Her friend covering
the display of.	212.02134848906056
_Esprit de corps_.	464.4941917069201
Well, what are you gaping at?	137.3966939112329
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	346.205864579584
Another gone.	98.02672708563878
—One of the best, M’Coy said.	160.78615866481383
The tram passed.	247.59024070022676
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
gloved hand on the steel grip.	413.86923885758335
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	261.78054757187573
—Wife well, I suppose?	293.2118376063729
M’Coy’s changed voice said.	241.14703434542307
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	321.5656384545453
Tiptop, thanks.	125.16499985741288
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
	477.2179474926176
What is home without
	137.46844652238363
Plumtree’s Potted Meat?	293.94734758484253
With it an abode of bliss.	177.22721101416684
—My missus has just got an engagement.	382.0314475213499
At least it’s not settled yet.	206.22864702696194
Valise tack again.	302.97527824082096
By the way no harm.	111.6940832895999
I’m off that, thanks.	147.61800841348477
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	549.4162089830742
—My wife too, he said.	92.8942067558078
She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the
Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	260.61758101045433
—That so?	50.1242710750977
M’Coy said.	165.5081573229974
Glad to hear that, old man.	93.81203253157084
Who’s getting it up?	92.40502763102111
Mrs Marion Bloom.	494.0867752080217
Not up yet.	113.12903689191404
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread
and.	163.60909055742778
No book.	99.6214427226191
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	539.2807444568099
Dark lady and fair man.	145.56047896140336
Cat furry black ball.	525.174290020523
Torn strip of
envelope.	257.9202910270068
Love’s
	29.459917166355844
Comes lo-ove’s old...	334.3001823587074
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	209.84349521178714
_Sweeeet song_.	317.52817152557833
There’s a committee formed.	204.14166933411076
Part shares and part
profits.	376.47369865050223
M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	536.7984806323337
—O, well, he said.	66.30364066877165
That’s good news.	148.79823552700086
He moved to go.	120.08699552408406
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	160.65036347175774
Meet you knocking around.	225.81696264485805
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
—Tell you what, M’Coy said.	225.06776711833834
You might put down my name at the funeral,
will you?	150.8443124847103
I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see.	259.9492996796742
There’s a
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
would have to go down if the body is found.	192.59468230540185
You just shove in my name
if I’m not there, will you?	213.29549890757806
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	255.3490101990843
That’ll be all right.	115.68730425038092
—Right, M’Coy said brightly.	553.4594995609514
Thanks, old man.	85.91838969967048
I’d go if I possibly
could.	348.1909723280415
Well, tolloll.	464.672675952932
Just C.	203.15938669399281
M’Coy will do.	219.10921527345192
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	562.7628234706686
Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze.	351.99480403105866
The quick touch.	245.30887194149904
Soft mark.	156.74239962289175
I’d
like my job.	173.72493045694486
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	236.16092646766216
Capped
corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	1583.1248677902267
Bob Cowley lent him
his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings
of it from that good day to this.	250.15329928084736
My missus has
just got an.	260.9261895849894
Reedy freckled soprano.	973.2393331558894
Cheeseparing nose.	109.33143901999652
Nice enough in
its way: for a little ballad.	162.47908828779623
No guts in it.	101.15765910203768
You and me, don’t you
know: in the same boat.	106.45299298116083
Give you the needle that would.	103.90293303913398
Can’t he hear the difference?	119.55079990224115
Think he’s that way inclined a bit.	107.96857663523312
Against my grain somehow.	398.3047569670175
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	257.9600000828816
I hope
that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.	313.75420586183094
Your wife and my wife.	108.54548245479329
Wonder is he pimping after me?	151.73739476825594
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings.	277.3692779013006
Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	413.0613901385665
Clery’s
Summer Sale.	293.94734758484253
No, he’s going on straight.	108.31861500141926
_Leah_ tonight.	156.71887038251194
Mrs
Bandmann Palmer.	494.0867752080217
Like to see her again in that.	69.78881156572916
Male impersonator.	365.4416887200119
Perhaps he was a woman.	53.741560961731246
Why Ophelia
committed suicide.	918.7946538508396
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in
that.	254.43936844546832
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	161.63295183241448
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	246.8803735733283
And Ristori in Vienna.	266.42991961718036
What
is this the right name is?	92.101032251517
By Mosenthal it is.	125.98829165910159
The
scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham
recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	220.68731790870896
Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left
his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of
his father and left the God of his father.	177.71635290320947
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	280.8569551086561
Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his
face.	316.1889499555854
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
him.	393.5341602683822
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
hazard.	224.4459770976454
No use thinking of it any more.	160.66475622557172
Nosebag time.	59.26338156361836
Wish I hadn’t met
that M’Coy fellow.	531.2721485478369
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently
champing teeth.	378.6334300153523
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	321.5754846648745
Their Eldorado.	203.15938669399281
Poor jugginses! Damn
all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
nosebags.	402.17377544192584
Too full for words.	136.64787527955204
Still they get their feed all right and
their doss.	207.69260463724675
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
between their haunches.	440.0022551129116
Might be happy all the same that way.	112.04329234422272
Good poor
brutes they look.	239.33369792821838
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	408.53916748877424
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
carried.	160.59364697952532
Might just walk into her here.	171.45114876413277
The lane is safer.	302.2593572888057
He passed the cabman’s shelter.	177.7497092421294
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	211.8086911114645
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	297.6298411304092
_Voglio e non_.	357.81086629389137
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	208.40875160527747
Shout a
few flying syllables as they pass.	282.4399661356791
He hummed:
	287.40150812754337
Là ci darem la mano
	1075.860556931027
La la lala la la.	694.877913458049
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in
the lee of the station wall.	236.26637458620007
No-one.	47.004415340154765
Meade’s timberyard.	182.05797938722498
Piled balks.	464.672675952932
Ruins and tenements.	146.38760187934352
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch
court with its forgotten pickeystone.	456.7274490961233
Not a sinner.	119.83502638025794
Near the timberyard
a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	383.5986157248165
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	626.5797974160388
Pity to
disturb them.	138.8379460071749
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	162.16274347559403
Open it.	30.60773084408939
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s
school.	406.07016023182507
She liked mignonette.	564.3356649116268
Mrs Ellis’s.	136.37444050802486
And Mr?	203.15938669399281
He opened the letter
within the newspaper.	185.70299844262357
A flower.	121.46106745308957
I think it’s a.	62.18274376836159
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	565.233363829526
Not
annoyed then?	265.6166904331451
What does she say?	132.18061813636325
Dear Henry
	203.15938669399281
I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	154.4921997170323
I am sorry
you did not like my last letter.	212.0477418023914
Why did you enclose the stamps?	202.7779128790094
I am
awfully angry with you.	229.09486245513446
I do wish I could punish you for that.	251.42053237317273
I called
you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	255.47355699741854
Please tell me
what is the real meaning of that word?	141.31796489251283
Are you not happy in your home
you poor little naughty boy?	207.27223179012114
I do wish I could do something for you.	229.03900572647456
I often think of the
beautiful name you have.	134.21540659266537
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	275.21576455047494
I think of you
so often you have no idea.	144.5930750660174
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a
man as you.	173.55553528442505
I feel so bad about.	179.73938077665258
Please write me a long letter and tell
me more.	151.04914301434263
So now you know what
I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	189.87429073210274
O how I long to
meet you.	197.33886903406852
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
exhausted.	405.31221256357975
Then I will tell you all.	180.32005809960808
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
have such a bad headache.	407.1638841307872
and write _by return_ to your longing
	536.5506604613034
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	234.7154200092191
I want to
know.	91.24992067098948
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
and placed it in his heart pocket.	324.24067722722384
Language of flowers.	80.06945686249473
They like it
because no-one can hear.	145.8755832147319
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	247.2642509250913
Then
walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
there a word.	199.78678737875228
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it
back in his sidepocket.	119.08332988030374
Weak joy opened his lips.	263.55195685927634
Changed since the first letter.	138.56557458230293
Wonder did
she wrote it herself.	173.51480949299943
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like
me, respectable character.	230.69456910026977
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	259.6950124363665
Thank you: not having any.	123.03112444288439
Usual love scrimmage.	347.74463166669244
Then running round
corners.	365.7450386290327
Bad as a row with Molly.	148.97838993369157
Cigar has a cooling effect.	266.0372173332839
Go further next time.	299.60084624120003
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	222.5043016272951
Brutal, why not?	91.22683212557567
Try it anyhow.	98.54901142726885
A bit at a time.	90.52892354498398
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	106.62271919446158
Common pin, eh?	301.00914528159535
Out of her clothes somewhere:
pinned together.	271.1652982459713
Queer the number of pins they always have.	141.3183329188304
No roses
without thorns.	561.022283110103
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	301.41202700386077
Those two sluts that night in
the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	200.79522075706916
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	209.4468495002798
She didn’t know what to do
	122.65580441126502
To keep it up,
	98.20348175971702
To keep it up.	98.20348175971702
Such a bad headache.	171.5095284245737
Or sitting all
day typing.	310.57968360548927
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	340.7552594690029
What perfume does your
wife use.	321.9254704337437
Now could you make out a thing like that?	106.76100386060641
To keep it up.	98.20348175971702
Martha, Mary.	203.15938669399281
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
faked for money.	389.16216810232424
He is sitting in their house, talking.	161.08163260793665
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	173.04157097838612
To keep it up.	98.20348175971702
Nice kind of evening feeling.	198.10335291623625
No more wandering about.	205.97996237019728
Just loll there:
quiet dusk: let everything rip.	723.7486137945606
Tell about places you have
been, strange customs.	315.9808316988112
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the
supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like
the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	253.7451935454639
Must carry a paper goblet next time I
go to the trottingmatches.	340.0800414294417
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	324.2557456862396
Tell
her: more and more: all.	82.34578841206678
Then a sigh: silence.	179.05801100859813
Long long long rest.	194.00282202687544
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	252.31692167258643
The shreds fluttered
away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	425.07318566820885
Henry Flower.	203.15938669399281
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
same way.	170.45242587367343
Simple bit of paper.	106.17070200281975
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	324.0484274747589
Shows you the money to be
made out of porter.	100.44436595884866
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
his shirt four times a day, they say.	220.9918687878902
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	934.357805921522
A
million pounds, wait a moment.	281.7499375503449
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
porter.	281.3148946640273
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	236.07095761267766
Yes, exactly.	177.75576849003383
Fifteen
millions of barrels of porter.	211.49699178016294
What am I saying barrels?	529.8219214150935
About a million barrels all the
same.	143.45285549711863
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	881.2997882089409
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	446.18760551285544
The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	669.3779206402496
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	325.86126668128543
Stepping into the
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
again behind the leather headband.	211.61769940554888
Damn it.	30.60773084408939
I might have tried to work
M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	287.7519714911827
Same notice on the door.	101.91570350487234
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	347.5781228720597
on saint Peter Claver S.	777.6293227363777
and the African Mission.	218.31192906870345
Prayers for the
conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	190.0832438737116
The protestants are the same.	148.23685473017255
Convert Dr William J.	770.5244035147354
Walsh D.D.	494.0867752080217
to the
true religion.	150.55612776532365
Save China’s millions.	274.5114660597021
Wonder how they explain it to the
heathen Chinee.	212.0929749078089
Prefer an ounce of opium.	283.0396770021326
Rank heresy for
them.	229.52793274254518
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	144.1946442994928
Taking it easy
with hand under his cheek.	170.98165276694843
Josssticks burning.	177.75576849003383
Not like Ecce Homo.	371.67733534547887
Crown of thorns and cross.	165.36826307056737
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	480.94580389579795
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	603.4536013742951
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of
that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.	344.082787844062
They’re taught that.	189.2345133653101
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	412.21267563336573
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
listening.	286.4873649201178
Still life.	74.3944362559787
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	281.6098915974126
He trod the worn steps,
pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	364.9488486541648
Something going on: some sodality.	227.68604651687832
Pity so empty.	163.33277590499665
Nice discreet place
to be next some girl.	267.2327611743421
Who is my neighbour?	139.81677613854407
Jammed by the hour to slow
music.	134.35054499464002
That woman at midnight mass.	279.87326390400983
Seventh heaven.	132.91381965096554
Women knelt in the
benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	476.8977306922861
A batch
knelt at the altarrails.	330.39999503412884
The priest went along by them, murmuring,
holding the thing in his hands.	200.6622786932168
He stopped at each, took out a
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
neatly into her mouth.	215.64251103349355
Her hat and head sank.	176.3173950673624
Then the next one.	71.46582229593722
Then the next one: a small old woman.	124.3820664743178
The priest bent
down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	178.46780864400506
The next
one.	121.80704381930063
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	148.41995425545832
_Corpus:_ body.	88.27746146168583
Good idea the Latin.	165.08243330984246
Stupefies them first.	89.938702205688
Hospice for the dying.	69.72354107963731
They
don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	257.41393022566865
Rum idea: eating bits of a
corpse.	256.86573393510844
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	166.71932557212324
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
one, and seek their places.	362.1903611695817
He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	271.74901729840735
These pots we have to wear.	221.2922225448743
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	303.4482618197925
They were about him here
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
it to melt in their stomachs.	241.79725151279933
Something like those mazzoth: it’s that
sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	308.01378544319437
Look at them.	62.68668157884366
Now I bet it makes
them feel happy.	408.0059028480687
It does.	92.59267022339893
Yes, bread of angels it’s called.	158.29971201697478
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you
feel.	200.86097185496178
First communicants.	464.672675952932
Hokypoky penny a lump.	181.71278113301918
Then feel all like one
family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	182.65961381311888
I’m
sure of that.	84.76935399989364
Not so lonely.	167.23938083464344
In our confraternity.	307.23299183198895
Let off steam.	217.53951886402425
Thing is if you really believe in it.	118.59776907751511
Lourdes
cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	492.6735131603501
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	375.35219247440784
Hence those snores.	283.29413167420967
Blind
faith.	148.24995216462548
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	107.72482767242064
Lulls all pain.	141.00237111448598
Wake this time
next year.	212.36244481462555
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
affair he had on.	276.4144948316311
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	78.06751563018403
He wouldn’t know what
to do to.	109.67694774036337
Bald spot behind.	230.39104500233668
Letters on his back: I.N.R.I?	422.46636209109533
No: I.H.S.	770.5244035147354
Molly told me one time I asked her.	206.6039268697094
I have sinned: or no: I have
suffered, it is.	248.05737516058053
And the other one?	54.513216262665274
Iron nails ran in.	206.4211553279372
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	204.5024566558807
Do not deny my request.	300.83627995005645
Dusk and the light behind her.	74.36206406221878
She might be here
with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
sly.	139.01162361957043
That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the
invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
every morning.	206.845249958202
This very church.	166.2646561615803
Peter Carey, yes.	220.23206265744474
No, Peter Claver I
am thinking of.	467.67334555637154
Denis Carey.	203.15938669399281
And just imagine that.	145.82343527828343
Wife and six
children at home.	161.7646980448371
And plotting that murder all the time.	191.02205147570265
Those
crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something
shiftylooking about them.	205.4153961594372
They’re not straight men of business either.	267.9366046534241
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no.	111.19411246391316
By the way, did I tear up
that envelope?	225.55697599145017
Yes: under the bridge.	97.47896670654914
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
smartly.	313.17653246934145
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage
Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale
(aromatic).	479.5429457703447
Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	179.55982339582457
Cold comfort.	236.73282115525478
Queer
the whole atmosphere of the.	78.27110568217364
Quite right.	69.27235476835287
Perfectly right that is.	72.8920245259229
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	275.03321396661727
Not going to be any music.	135.89559569878537
Who has the organ here I wonder?	260.2213454122491
Old Glynn he knew how to make
that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he
had in Gardiner street.	266.8134929568047
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat
Mater_ of Rossini.	199.76789625618258
Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first.	473.36054668907974
Christ or
Pilate?	172.5226360342497
Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it.	164.17133995496883
Music they wanted.	112.43227417875983
Footdrill stopped.	132.91603643076527
Could hear a pin drop.	232.54766871613117
I told her to pitch her voice
against that corner.	198.40284412586752
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
people looking up:
	131.31139806570997
_Quis est homo._
	364.7211555428557
Some of that old sacred music splendid.	197.23962052184018
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	245.86192599392447
Those old popes keen on music,
on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	295.9307537477557
Palestrina for example
too.	130.11045844698722
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	223.1652707109652
Healthy too, chanting,
regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	808.1197960585977
Green Chartreuse.	203.15938669399281
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	216.21118229150147
What kind of voice is it?	93.08826104415715
Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.	212.47559776778496
Kind of a placid.	92.51058478302139
No worry.	365.4355909322164
Fall into flesh, don’t they?	175.54401136301288
Gluttons,
tall, long legs.	318.02021296741106
Who knows?	105.53615530262273
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
bless all the people.	167.2054958085275
All crossed themselves and stood up.	199.97002265958704
Mr Bloom
glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	271.78970372167765
Stand
up at the gospel of course.	100.91545800793864
Then all settled down on their knees again
and he sat back quietly in his bench.	207.26045141212757
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
card:
	168.4211835611165
—O God, our refuge and our strength...	357.23241062223326
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	197.00172774250998
Throw them
the bone.	97.45284204853733
I remember slightly.	271.28727438831953
How long since your last mass?	288.1444829625029
Glorious
and immaculate virgin.	243.4541009435843
Joseph, her spouse.	161.94444869875662
Peter and Paul.	109.91965027550245
More
interesting if you understood what it was all about.	155.94165854839025
Wonderful
organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	817.6897511656251
Everyone wants
to.	85.66094397819319
Then I will tell you all.	180.32005809960808
Punish me, please.	124.34470797639851
Great weapon
in their hands.	168.60317649031342
More than doctor or solicitor.	304.331939026007
Woman dying to.	90.69177696732716
And I
schschschschschsch.	857.7157624187907
And did you chachachachacha?	200.24362296737775
And why did you?	99.43214244298399
Look
down at her ring to find an excuse.	184.56679755045445
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	496.52484331395897
God’s little joke.	159.66552252963882
Then out she comes.	117.07657077316955
Repentance skindeep.	464.672675952932
Lovely shame.	174.05701931214955
Pray at an altar.	149.5957304866317
Hail Mary and Holy
Mary.	408.26256885177355
Flowers, incense, candles melting.	826.3186586369628
Hide her blushes.	173.56132328379957
Salvation
army blatant imitation.	955.9813065802335
How I found the Lord.	291.88599978557266
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they
work the whole show.	247.12176470196016
And don’t they rake in the money too?	147.91750577680958
Bequests
also: to the P.P.	200.00555086085168

Masses

No browbeating him.	273.101399948606
He had his answer pat for everything.	191.64835289888643
Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church.	177.73107821887567
The doctors of
the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	184.43577768353464
The priest prayed:
	308.70105378891765
—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	374.0296202435257
Be our
safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of
souls.	322.56369019862893
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	166.96991150900212
All over.	56.2025789643362
The women
remained behind: thanksgiving.	549.799669741298
Better be shoving along.	278.6230087355409
Brother Buzz.	203.15938669399281
Come around with the plate
perhaps.	170.1507553996056
Pay your Easter duty.	380.5270517416035
He stood up.	110.8653403964626
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
time?	167.08336484106692
Women enjoy it.	136.75683921239664
Never tell you.	76.73244059025589
But we.	54.95620389526568
Excuse, miss, there’s a
(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	278.814080736605
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	568.2632129133063
Glimpses of the moon.	48.66996285118795
Annoyed if you don’t.	98.57398145175122
Why didn’t you tell me
before.	157.20169981859016
Still like you better untidy.	209.50125095992527
Good job it wasn’t farther south.	330.36177412055224
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the
main door into the light.	251.55567653194583
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black
marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive
hands in the low tide of holy water.	353.092976240716
Trams: a car of Prescott’s
dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	204.2250835320198
Notice because I’m in mourning myself.	290.22111480247526
He covered himself.	213.50303484749486
How goes the time?	90.32968419604438
Quarter past.	93.85060419729737
Time enough yet.	200.31624545808967
Better get that lotion made up.	182.87795402881002
Where is this?	65.40039978533191
Ah yes, the last time.	88.41691463160139
Sweny’s in Lincoln place.	140.33876569189223
Chemists rarely move.	553.229506045339
Their green and gold
beaconjars too heavy to stir.	316.1714076463973

the flood.	144.80195533159417
Huguenot churchyard near there.	303.6622992236122
Visit some day.	108.84703629084704
He walked southward along Westland row.	710.4828587657156
But the recipe is in the other
trousers.	105.49218547883636
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	284.1507546859537
Bore this funeral affair.	319.8487817645632
O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault.	151.65853315287737
When was it I got it made up
last?	172.58976768578816
I changed a sovereign I remember.	392.61615382679236
First of the month it
must have been or the second.	99.15231188672465
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions
book.	136.68110183321238
The chemist turned back page after page.	445.1051697560146
Sandy shrivelled smell he
seems to have.	227.62144095583054
Shrunken skull.	191.00624126451842
And old.	54.289585599329996

expect it.	191.55367862361845
Clever of nature.	67.37406786159973
—About a fortnight ago, sir?	217.41125450613345
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	395.6891481883184
Lot of time taken up telling
your aches and pains.	270.06267711995145
—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
orangeflower water...	520.642224471077
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	353.67085548115335
—And white wax also, he said.	187.14761545636784
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	87.54410524855476
Looking at me, the sheet up to her
eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
cuffs.	283.1699507262
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	490.73280777846344
One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it?	148.09114356461603
had only
one skin.	164.58338814173862
Leopold, yes.	60.45787357664621
Three we have.	77.56159737913677
Warts, bunions and pimples to
make it worse.	260.76280405555855
But you want a perfume too.	132.80630588214774
What perfume does your?	228.00105426969586
_Peau d’Espagne_.	270.7644164861342
That orangeflower water is so fresh.	303.50827166742096
Nice smell these
soaps have.	364.7902016752711
Pure curd soap.	700.4241717557197
Time to get a bath round the corner.	112.0131077865964
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	293.85828313019414
Nicer if a
nice girl did it.	127.67098270858436
Also I think I.	493.12142075985906
Yes I.	203.15938669399281
Do it in the bath.	61.60379026723215
Curious

Feel fresh then all the day.	110.86560418299518
Funeral be rather glum.	309.3698177124108
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	125.74490682338767
That was two and nine.	94.78950678533141
Have you brought a
bottle?	127.79545061685968
—No, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
Make it up, please.	107.05201646394228
I’ll call later in the day and
I’ll take one of these soaps.	226.36312534960703
How much are they?	110.03310770071964
—Fourpence, sir.	71.8721773002824
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	254.175752642801
—I’ll take this one, he said.	118.87048615991463
That makes three and a penny.	133.8114787573951
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	125.74490682338767
You can pay all together, sir, when you
come back.	211.06912358616682
—Good, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	231.70870614539433
At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:
	275.2673668847247
—Hello, Bloom.	203.15938669399281
What’s the best news?	102.45274109623257
Is that today’s?	80.45620979625403
Show us a minute.	124.2791205637893
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	495.55909060170774
To look
younger.	246.98534719612266
He does look balmy.	328.31793509832437
Younger than I am.	298.7651632152282
Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	532.7239400894983
Wants a
wash too.	117.72621089392122
Take off the rough dirt.	222.26126463089994
Good morning, have you used Pears’
soap?	319.2944417925208
Dandruff on his shoulders.	89.15363175499809
Scalp wants oiling.	515.153412605182
—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam
Lyons said.	279.5313334561268
Where the bugger is it?	86.84226336959544
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	428.9898093116552
Barber’s itch.	170.8195241583146
Tight collar he’ll lose his hair.	212.8076415419859
Better leave him the
paper and get shut of him.	118.95311379339141
—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	294.7671159443107
Gold cup.	122.33831166975367
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	881.6894086557335
Half a mo.	128.42520171772162
Maximum the
second.	51.503280419232304
—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	235.4074627045651
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
his sharp voice said.	186.72202297538996
—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	315.2005065242465
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.	603.0337817363825
—I’ll risk it, he said.	136.4941545840946
Here, thanks.	125.16499985741288
He sped off towards Conway’s corner.	413.2219652578508
God speed scut.	829.2146282159706
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
in it, smiling.	239.73641928623744
Silly lips of that chap.	106.90433473243357
Regular hotbed of it
lately.	255.52348483417646
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	323.2433443314179

tender turkey.	385.2520559054963
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	445.83224519233045
Jack Fleming
embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	589.2625708077067
Keeps a hotel now.	105.70215241350671
They never come back.	138.0389834581497
Fleshpots of Egypt.	106.7296495237354
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	272.83514079833185
College sports today I see.	474.4618360669923
He
eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist
doubled up like a cod in a pot.	338.46511602030193
Damn bad ad.	236.10354332843164
Now if they had made it
round like a wheel.	153.09087516744663
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the
hub big: college.	441.7214061710588
Something to catch the eye.	91.35519133899673
There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge.	221.2198341128818
Keep him on hands:
might take a turn in there on the nod.	136.67220116983546
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	271.0223219899474
How do you do, sir?	110.8168878933171
Heavenly weather really.	313.09534031746654
If life was always like that.	107.89585016360965
Cricket weather.	174.05411526313088
Sit around under sunshades.	381.4909509599465
Over after over.	89.75031848224579
They can’t play it
here.	153.64095339856496
Duck for six wickets.	282.6911256106378
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	326.3212163505775
Donnybrook fair more in
their line.	164.7920137832111
And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the
floor.	350.6433750621098
Won’t last.	99.26746256669998
Always passing, the stream of life, which
in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	195.32034763667508
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
stream.	481.8212475553535
This is my body.	109.5392176188673
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	515.7296430954581
He saw his trunk
and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father
of thousands, a languid floating flower.	453.31810633485173
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	494.4148688547722
Mr Power stepped in
after him, curving his height with care.	315.3129894052701
—Come on, Simon.	146.0554807867269
—After you, Mr Bloom said.	251.8427620372992
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
	286.0444072748013
—Yes, yes.	60.45787357664621
—Are we all here now?	115.37044382008386
Martin Cunningham asked.	255.87999104604643
Come along, Bloom.	285.9941465157321
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	241.16858602053514
He pulled the door to
after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	218.49392093669422
He passed an arm
through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	264.5143192301532
One dragged aside: an old woman
peeping.	462.19492123230856
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	367.00274366177877
Thanking her stars she
was passed over.	152.4021467172959
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	128.14905175584445
Glad
to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	220.68910435114466
Job seems to suit them.	180.72718617680874
Huggermugger in corners.	128.19591036054507
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d
wake.	235.58110071784466
Then getting it ready.	191.2405989610155
Laying it out.	49.92009457727848
Molly and Mrs Fleming
making the bed.	235.87959277201227
Pull it more to your side.	104.88192704134106
Our windingsheet.	317.52287348145126
Never know
who will touch you dead.	187.5600052990898
Wash and shampoo.	159.89774194967887
I believe they clip the
nails and the hair.	157.91047712787105
Keep a bit in an envelope.	110.64687625376905
Grows all the same
after.	69.93679899400232
Unclean job.	123.25150931121024
All waited.	161.760269782343
Nothing was said.	48.855388494615276
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	133.0504507719302
I am
sitting on something hard.	233.23324925878896
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	208.54351247152297
Better
shift it out of that.	91.35261023878915
Wait for an opportunity.	146.7601342804442
All waited.	161.760269782343
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
then horses’ hoofs.	383.36702725630226
A jolt.	365.4416887200119
Their carriage began to move, creaking and
swaying.	345.01547543924175
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	486.8168945519119
The blinds of
the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	405.6660177239376
At walking pace.	280.6735048616384
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks.	332.0224546616315
Tritonville road.	117.34105602787314
The wheels
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes.	461.47690987896857
—What way is he taking us?	133.08859588322525
Mr Power asked through both windows.	411.22457476364747
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	339.27239792854846
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	369.30934669348636
—That’s a fine old custom, he said.	122.50341207456945
I am glad to see it has not died
out.	178.2556409305829
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers.	499.1667452568775
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past Watery lane.	403.7060975047869
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
clad in mourning, a wide hat.	354.4927807875062
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	151.09368203722667
—Who is that?	43.8437134325822
—Your son and heir.	157.90679014233953
—Where is he?	40.04036031893841
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	425.2081246203285
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	444.16133968658613
Mr Dedalus
fell back, saying:
	393.0533812498783
—Was that Mulligan cad with him?	219.4078824650205
His _fidus Achates_!
	730.7949289280941
—No, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He was alone.	101.59941981564867
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	402.80774483757307
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	705.7161282269591
Wallace Bros: the
bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	526.8011739353034
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	200.60432716078833
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
the firm.	225.1141627239397
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	322.62638093939233
Great card he was.	84.85777966697232
Waltzing
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.	278.6153740657184
Out on the rampage all night.	127.94735958945475
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	167.22769897239505
Wife
ironing his back.	192.37551193651413
Thinks he’ll cure it with pills.	186.48666687910898
All breadcrumbs they
are.	261.9004382319824
About six hundred per cent profit.	721.7437237309773
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	401.72620410433933
That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	503.61795777678833
His name stinks
all over Dublin.	342.5940420759012
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
gate.	207.40887301768487
I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	290.50980363497774
He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
	183.62667479504216
—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	245.3292385225986
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s.	636.4693126908186
Not likely.	209.19524368391612
He ceased.	191.01261463938192
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	456.0088393387946
Noisy
selfwilled man.	309.49654490623044
Full of his son.	57.94623532249117
He is right.	77.29444758516017
Something to hand on.	59.57379478392392
If
little Rudy had lived.	302.67933385056614
See him grow up.	145.61971394728894
Hear his voice in the house.	65.1972729862785
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	389.96408083293534
Me in his eyes.	51.36273214457983
Strange
feeling it would be.	133.30662394473325
From me.	43.12221257392657
Just a chance.	91.317786558934
Must have been that
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	169.5327832509383
And the sergeant grinning
up.	231.81321034986743
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	226.56858668203512
Give us
a touch, Poldy.	214.7901645337768
God, I’m dying for it.	207.4836198890804
How life begins.	242.22755808960937
Got big then.	112.83460178274747
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	253.8288378879534
My son inside her.	169.05242030177374
I could have helped him on in life.	142.35709874078555
I could.	63.48751133128967
Make him independent.	156.37240262809013
Learn German too.	209.68482357821497
—Are we late?	149.54659601287582
Mr Power asked.	255.87999104604643
—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	333.13770970039343
Same thing watered down.	322.8080929664333
Her tomboy oaths.	833.826546145993
Dearest Papli.	203.15938669399281
Young student.	161.75487270836388
Yes, yes: a woman too.	96.63486927440613
Life, life.	74.3944362559787
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	448.8482996804588
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	441.29474054086995
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him.	359.3486022560684
Do
you follow me?	120.40289255220645
He closed his left eye.	189.26478362049974
Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	412.13372872934633
—What is this, he said, in the name of God?	86.99592919018544
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
said.	409.7371288048456
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats.	384.8653290070954
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:
	401.42185193205995
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken.	725.0005789122941
What do you think, Martin?	193.56656251870203
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	355.372934099775
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	311.22277801257326
Glad I took that bath.	286.9312966155711
Feel my feet quite
clean.	255.1386099503258
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	878.7281088625887
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	883.0339614475481
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.	86.8014057918716
—Did Tom Kernan turn up?	427.18715136222266
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	563.6953224967002
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	262.0197391317943
—And Corny Kelleher himself?	457.15406029264204
Mr Power asked.	255.87999104604643
—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	302.9388839067897
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	599.5497707980868
He said he’d try to come.	118.99646699864815
The carriage halted short.	394.5548861978128
—What’s wrong?	98.10108912989222
—We’re stopped.	214.44278056498487
—Where are we?	82.72815416928195
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	129.08643643784023
—The grand canal, he said.	188.9661886956542
Whooping cough they say it cures.	282.565223817007
Good job Milly never got
it.	271.45887272089
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	267.5382093517195
Shame
really.	120.57808696479673
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	449.7693540966775
Only measles.	464.672675952932
Flaxseed
tea.	108.18733242156206
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	1142.2921202053549
Canvassing for death.	91.97667348871101
Don’t miss
this chance.	213.3596717043335
Dogs’ home over there.	127.53133488514175
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
Leopold, is my last wish.	401.5595056454675
Thy will be done.	134.13390260181112
We obey them in the grave.	146.05411935593676
A dying scrawl.	499.10848235944314
He took it to heart, pined away.	215.9053738788811
Quiet brute.	209.20222464996462
Old men’s
dogs usually are.	277.1260289087302
A raindrop spat on his hat.	333.27616755657453
He drew back and saw an instant of shower
spray dots over the grey flags.	377.9374900730296
Like through a
colander.	179.0596210116651
I thought it would.	105.56647190723088
My boots were creaking I remember now.	438.4885498716469
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.	239.30645340024358
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	313.6601730737419
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	203.4978874555481
There’s the sun again coming
out.	110.45737479084531
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled
a mute curse at the sky.	398.4839008003917
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.	139.12910886242818
—We’re off again.	161.4296557637553
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently.	533.9822030724051
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	328.8749173229986
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	218.70677791568022
And Paddy Leonard taking
him off to his face.	229.40427859783608
—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	515.3201169556816
Wait till you hear
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	424.4168311294558
—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	655.6895908365774
_His singing of that simple
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
whole course of my experience._
	279.6900250669065
—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	408.90926192930294
He’s dead nuts on that.	133.43742476412035
And the
retrospective arrangement.	215.9586276422708
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?	326.44050262373986
Martin Cunningham asked.	255.87999104604643
—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	258.3012251600724
Where is it?	44.73630436839303
—In the paper this morning.	109.2312098709863
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	219.20090794135825
That book I must change
for her.	252.54886246483306
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	357.92586896658577
Later on please.	103.07691834402868
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s?	122.34150568202651
no, Sexton,
Urbright.	494.0867752080217
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	535.0389922788123
Thanks to the Little Flower.	156.56636874561974
Sadly missed.	236.73282115525478
To the inexpressible grief
of his.	134.79403306366757
Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness.	313.207740958539
Month’s mind:
Quinlan.	201.66320476898792
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	591.6532956279676
It is now a month since dear Henry fled
	395.26814033704915
To his home up above in the sky
	126.57389720930318
While his family weeps and mourns his loss
	324.74966226609473
Hoping some day to meet him on high.	141.15948909238966
I tore up the envelope?	186.79768207889074
Where did I put her letter after I read it
in the bath?	231.0052050283843
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	428.71303050756995
There all right.	76.4165853829928
Dear Henry
fled.	730.7786697822536
Before my patience are exhausted.	312.2461355407071
Meade’s yard.	116.49060666948097
The hazard.	317.52817152557833
Only two there now.	103.44299903116301
Full as a tick.	136.08412546071534
Too much bone in their skulls.	256.53606116659284
The other trotting round
with a fare.	223.59702365131298
An hour ago I was passing there.	326.8116910768522
The jarvies raised their
hats.	473.3757708921339
A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window.	644.0842834711241
Couldn’t they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	367.7683671227897
Well but that fellow
would lose his job then?	190.73305851637872
Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?	236.16732967027176
Antient concert rooms.	398.5044107698089
Nothing on there.	54.17068876438
Not much grief there.	213.726998121052
Quarter mourning.	150.21429608575608
People in law
perhaps.	134.07303124839035
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence.	304.25968992493375
Hoardings: Eugene
Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	1201.6266902949878
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I
wonder.	468.47061221014206
I said I.	166.43304312438676
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	147.12791986540188
Elster Grimes Opera
Company.	770.5244035147354
Big powerful change.	349.2411437320875
Wet bright bills for next week.	394.6304898586177
_Fun on
the Bristol_.	87.38578639041786
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	215.3474896334784
Have
to stand a drink or two.	130.26696180583497
As broad as it’s long.	129.1232517166315
He’s coming in the afternoon.	93.87884577933112
Her songs.	209.20222464996462
Plasto’s.	29.459917166355844
Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust.	973.516453411111
Who was he?	36.687470903949105
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
salute.	248.22733903368606
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.	348.19971801234686
Yes, he does.	70.08758282683876
How do you do?	82.49944156314739
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	521.8984454213411
There he is airing his quiff.	220.49998440775815
Just that moment I was thinking.	222.37813516863676
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	392.9162583500339
From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	310.3188856832366
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand.	196.93914294480257
The nails, yes.	204.34466584805378
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	141.12494431438262
Worst man in Dublin.	139.82817132108812
That keeps him alive.	283.19739868028205
They sometimes
feel what a person is.	170.30722253025704
But a type like that.	105.67466825785984
My nails.	181.7704264911698
I am
just looking at them: well pared.	275.4858895138634
And after: thinking alone.	240.8551805382056
Body
getting a bit softy.	237.4393477489728
I would notice that: from remembering.	228.2212713209227
What causes
that?	151.58063757741286
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh
falls off.	298.388808297717
But the shape is there.	87.0913494020636
The shape is there still.	172.27702913992115
Night of the dance dressing.	119.95449886669776
Shift stuck between the
cheeks behind.	230.62201650194046
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces.	349.92023144121976
Mr Power asked:
	255.87999104604643
—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	252.25486907326834
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	336.33886092932124
I hear great accounts of it.	177.0077880879056
It’s a good
idea, you see...	98.61288907517972
—Well no, Mr Bloom said.	293.54707579777823
In point of fact I have to go down to the
county Clare on some private business.	232.68740624789262
You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns.	193.55332134324485
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	120.21259071329587
—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	298.25998927463667
Mary Anderson is up there now.	163.5315688440404
Have you good artists?	199.73713264243196
—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	466.28785098337465
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	315.14980936201874
The best, in
fact.	121.61582289062441
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	593.8292717548903
Last but not least.	133.40977359910784
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and
clasped them.	312.0253692981113
Must be his deathday.	161.46493991838304
For many happy returns.	433.25727976199227
The carriage
wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting
knees.	769.2140081060513
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
mouth opening: oot.	355.9656974746029
—Four bootlaces for a penny.	195.02615726226227
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	159.93959642777307
Had his office in Hume street.	172.6041549290774
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	566.5469706866362
Has that silk hat ever since.	234.7621080073705
Relics of old decency.	140.74872639102665
Mourning too.	56.16717052284047
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	484.6674098117666
O’Callaghan on his last legs.	211.71954911016348
And _Madame_.	203.15938669399281
Twenty past eleven.	218.1861385435898
Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	139.95290099178976
Doing
her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	678.3213639460828
No: _vorrei e non_.	881.1111805527165
Looking
at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	165.5713760750053
_Mi trema un poco
il_.	1610.6796204068103
A thrush.	317.52287348145126
A
throstle.	287.39671252413314
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	186.55376704717244
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face.	476.4243311114804
Greyish over
the ears.	92.98094747615626
_Madame_: smiling.	131.69761147419345
I smiled back.	158.26733928281482
A smile goes a long way.	193.3798580144304
Only politeness perhaps.	390.2060748011039
Nice fellow.	83.79921129302102
Who knows is that true about the
woman he keeps?	153.75548355025157
Not pleasant for the wife.	111.726392314016
Yet they say, who was it
told me, there is no carnal.	158.4347238154549
You would imagine that would get played
out pretty quick.	300.8643278261285
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
a pound of rumpsteak.	242.02955411415675
What is this she was?	74.35492672195439
Barmaid in Jury’s.	101.45660086260203
Or the
Moira, was it?	82.96034490339395
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	1400.56508239155
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	105.60231886699552
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his
spine.	374.17886895996065
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	383.892337295515
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
	318.4745166024835
—The devil break the hasp of your back!
	224.53148013847368
Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as
the carriage passed Gray’s statue.	316.7158414676985
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	354.66299438889837
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes.	335.2002541769589
He caressed his beard, adding:
	468.42493857962455
—Well, nearly all of us.	124.54923434942842
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.	377.69158130860944
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and
the son.	188.10974254135013
—About the boatman?	93.43734975276341
Mr Power asked.	255.87999104604643
Isn’t it awfully good?	146.71488517305335
—What is that?	43.8437134325822
I didn’t hear it.	139.83526557416303
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were
both.....	184.3404107379669
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	336.5133644814606
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown.....	126.08554469689568
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	761.4650559799675
I wish to Christ he did!
	169.16349270111937
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	368.7747944073258
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	241.0622477561153
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
	709.565397928491
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	205.5352670774634
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	650.6780843030484
Is he dead?	71.00674718553086
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	544.0370749890304
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive.	192.66206197507933
Half the town was there.	81.5240476250633
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
But the funny part is.....	135.10264764574632
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son’s life.	376.5657081935391
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.	475.7039923118183
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	412.6756684903438
Like a hero.	97.13018102479612
A silver florin.	403.04107157003426
—Isn’t it awfully good?	146.71488517305335
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	319.5414756859314
—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	419.0716587654349
Nelson’s pillar.	111.58846440540854
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
	234.56639610232358
—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	323.94741595361376
Mr Dedalus sighed.	474.20157867516014
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.	301.93754383333976
Many a good one he told himself.	104.25973557831446
—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers.	405.8242835723092
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.	279.0120165729086
He’s gone from us.	115.37532289518302
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	284.158109011966
He went
very suddenly.	221.2909453098779
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	339.27239792854846
He tapped his chest sadly.	414.40571549178196
Blazing face: redhot.	303.5791699399764
Too much John Barleycorn.	481.550624629039
Cure for a red nose.	109.71133912364449
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	240.02327544692128
A lot of money he spent
colouring it.	245.37035609531836
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	446.2658861228016
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	156.81919376638757
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.	410.82507746876024
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	214.2424119661861
—No suffering, he said.	122.38821029013731
A moment and all is over.	93.63976455678433
Like dying in sleep.	162.770260340556
No-one spoke.	137.8009101890636
Dead side of the street this.	79.99359891759998
Dull business by day, land agents,
temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college,
Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	783.195021894231
Some reason.	134.19761745043093
Sun or
wind.	114.90900785032598
At night too.	102.87897675884126
Chummies and slaveys.	146.3859735476963
Under the patronage of the
late Father Mathew.	235.54457647341286
Foundation stone for Parnell.	249.99637594478932
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
galloping.	532.5624733574878
A tiny coffin flashed by.	423.86437149954577
In a hurry to bury.	154.88793528281076
A mourning
coach.	431.95492975292876
Piebald for bachelors.	168.88964421853092
Dun for
a nun.	91.56326748169764
—Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	339.27239792854846
A child.	109.92782853754251
A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was.	275.0531909736191
Dwarf’s
body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	388.9626808532836
Burial friendly society
pays.	658.3081256843107
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	167.3539848296398
Meant
nothing.	94.48607593588714
Mistake of nature.	67.37406786159973
If it’s healthy it’s from the mother.	97.26747913229073
If
not from the man.	61.46709428379623
Better luck next time.	251.78915963820938
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	339.59136111503943
It’s well out of it.	63.59611920774645
Rattle his
bones.	108.35973811078662
Over the stones.	72.42761434832086
Only a pauper.	128.42663019305917
Nobody owns.	249.71993668557914
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	234.43484759917573
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
life.	177.20089158574493
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	309.4933973418916
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	521.9893333494801
We
must take a charitable view of it.	183.0553158513969
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	224.16730140927947
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	226.26312923030744
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	246.51737010519795
Martin Cunningham’s
large eyes.	228.645337350606
Looking away now.	109.45454315385848
Sympathetic human man he is.	104.4117365876486
Like Shakespeare’s face.	169.50373199664207
Always a good word to say.	94.21321614164751
They have no mercy
on that here or infanticide.	202.72494988950197
Refuse christian burial.	483.23762097275096
They used to
drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	181.5156263313282
As if it wasn’t
broken already.	268.5374681022436
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	354.75686822648385
Found in the
riverbed clutching rushes.	286.8557251636983
He looked at me.	103.17649945471533
And that awful drunkard of
a wife of his.	126.03496373489119
Setting up house for her time after time and then
pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	225.5701140890433
Leading him the
life of the damned.	69.39096223860899
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	75.72141803921026
Monday
morning.	89.69348729814052
Start afresh.	464.672675952932
Shoulder to the wheel.	71.74582526627364
Lord, she must have
looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	158.1430187457587
Drunk about
the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.	195.3253615903802
And they call me the jewel of Asia,
	168.01756211649095
Of Asia,
	203.15938669399281
The geisha.	464.672675952932
He looked away from me.	139.1609967860969
He knows.	105.53615530262273
Rattle his bones.	108.35973811078662
That afternoon of the inquest.	161.6397405090573
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	243.58352447792606
The
room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	221.7377009358726
Stuffy it was.	40.06214827676117
Sunlight
through the slats of the Venetian blind.	174.86669233068966
The coroner’s sunlit ears, big
and hairy.	493.07652996391244
Boots giving evidence.	339.3712771037912
Thought he was asleep first.	125.58317715032175
Then saw
like yellow streaks on his face.	224.6208312204678
Verdict: overdose.	317.5334699131929
Death by misadventure.	204.68718324730332
The letter.	103.0984970092533
For my son
Leopold.	239.01637919299048
No more pain.	196.77312750539818
Wake no more.	84.04055748121733
Nobody owns.	249.71993668557914
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	698.5212674013604
Over the stones.	72.42761434832086
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	368.41474977817694
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	333.55102241919633
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	338.835071744623
That will be a great race tomorrow
in Germany.	227.15440492487335
The Gordon Bennett.	494.0867752080217
That will be worth seeing, faith.	327.94818839671376
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	290.66041117314717
Has
anybody here seen Kelly?	452.1001481018306
Kay ee double ell wy.	1115.2212525220236
Dead March from _Saul._
He’s as bad as old Antonio.	308.88964795964023
He left me on my ownio.	180.00878445307413
Pirouette! The
_Mater Misericordiae_.	770.5244035147354
Eccles street.	64.81816915559368
My house down there.	118.57245271150292
Big place.	85.0711300876451
Ward for incurables there.	197.23190034099372
Very encouraging.	287.40150812754337
Our Lady’s Hospice for the
dying.	199.30701162900863
Deadhouse handy underneath.	650.3971714925958
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	493.7309126473109
They
look terrible the women.	155.8038775476847
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
spoon.	249.71011537561057
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	146.8316396747962
Nice young student
that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	237.49482637785428
He’s gone over to the
lying-in hospital they told me.	145.33194210843465
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	393.36094520536676
—What’s wrong now?	120.56536371795622
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups.	753.1666412796778
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
fear.	421.5333956805672
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.	339.27239792854846
—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	353.28467838531793
Huuuh! out of that!
	42.67366931537504
Thursday, of course.	48.97904252468642
Tomorrow is killing day.	210.3630961584939
Cuffe sold
them about twentyseven quid each.	480.0271962559678
For Liverpool probably.	377.159571706142
Roastbeef for
old England.	161.52396457473162
They buy up all the juicy ones.	237.69106355511494
And then the fifth quarter
lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	397.9319743682291
Dead meat trade.	370.76839120005866
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
soap, margarine.	338.11441748450443
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
the train at Clonsilla.	400.2750760929996
The carriage moved on through the drove.	208.99951600486628
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	259.88773959121653
All those animals could be taken
in trucks down to the boats.	246.2741827044385
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	308.54918409844976
Quite
right.	69.27235476835287
They ought to.	79.76857877737531
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	326.761304429285
Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
and all.	206.1099318828806
Don’t you see what I mean?	195.19647060708814
—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	235.27039104542476
Pullman car and saloon
diningroom.	377.1044240749276
—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	716.5872658327967
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	484.68923230931665
Wouldn’t it be more decent
than galloping two abreast?	347.9499249350812
—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	266.2490233009256
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when
the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.	267.55619388556715
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road.	265.8990876847515
—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	445.6498590221938
Gordon Bennett cup.	352.33324422209864
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	434.8559753528727
Bom! Upset.	203.15938669399281
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	162.4177026098654
Burst open.	91.68388695368711
Paddy
Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too
large for him.	234.1416898330107
Red face: grey now.	172.75439075164442
Mouth fallen open.	269.26689367591047
Asking what’s up
now.	81.31911382162093
Quite right to close it.	110.04256539760856
Looks horrid open.	347.07343796160023
Then the insides
decompose quickly.	362.3869936466167
Much better to close up all the orifices.	169.2837478807354
Yes, also.	98.06269214184152
With wax.	191.01580163668595
The sphincter loose.	649.9511214994079
Seal up all.	59.55751164476901
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	313.7203453961875
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	635.474232848508
A
pause by the wayside.	240.46108227837107
Tiptop position for a pub.	179.07881701928642
Expect we’ll pull up
here on the way back to drink his health.	172.45811546837422
Pass round the consolation.	134.16200044896155
Elixir of life.	52.44132298153246
But suppose now it did happen.	207.6862886308371
He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose.	179.82068345831505
Depends on
where.	66.10165821608325
The circulation stops.	542.7085968697504
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	284.158895501688
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	174.5066683338339
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	468.7374868706651
An empty hearse trotted
by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	512.7694799203044
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	217.61123202492473
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	448.0076465299434
A man stood on his dropping
barge, between clamps of turf.	382.7717359210213
On the towpath by the lock a
slacktethered horse.	232.16500834380463
Aboard of the _Bugabu._
	67.09932970891309
Their eyes watched him.	151.48147589964745
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on
his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	722.8793507029895
Athlone, Mullingar,
Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	367.5639853441129
Or
cycle down.	281.1643858744696
Hire some old crock, safety.	456.06940880172925
Wren had one the other day at
the auction but a lady’s.	114.6325224044356
Developing waterways.	365.4416887200119
James M’Cann’s hobby to
row me o’er the ferry.	392.9168836585525
Cheaper transit.	287.40150812754337
By easy stages.	568.6273409631528
Camping out.	43.961956629777546
Also hearses.	365.4355909322164
To heaven by water.	178.3786848712165
Perhaps I will without
writing.	374.219374646099
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	306.2671858370568
Dropping down lock by
lock to Dublin.	301.0176693659757
With turf from the midland bogs.	367.61812706132616
He lifted his
brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	622.0801401759593
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	457.0769134192793
Near it now.	59.29887882116603
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	382.7002927615302
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	727.2316279474358
—How is that?	43.8437134325822
Martin Cunningham said.	165.5081573229974
Left him weeping, I suppose?	369.6472769298174
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	332.57769125637225
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	502.8203558092338
The stonecutter’s yard on the right.	178.9408890824383
Last lap.	191.01261463938192
Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
knelt in grief, pointing.	492.9216120830655
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	312.1338663780412
In white silence:
appealing.	427.92243653060206
The best obtainable.	370.32551709061136
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat,
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
yawning boot.	458.212778594528
After life’s journey.	194.24245366791715
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	290.3947512832471
Mr Power pointed.	451.9939283161314
—That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	183.59154758548084
The last house.	135.94945273065923
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	208.1037019597511
A gruesome case.	415.9244767451238
Seymour Bushe got him off.	209.0719404392968
Murdered his brother.	84.24206942531644
Or so they said.	76.08496430915358
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	404.21115566156334
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	1011.2118723163624
That’s the maxim of the
law.	79.55468734619967
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
person to be wrongfully condemned.	429.12389123260306
They looked.	91.11788356615433
Murderer’s ground.	102.20652392770849
It passed darkly.	340.08437035064975
Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden.	1298.0527777219029
Whole place gone to hell.	176.91989752437158
The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.	139.47723252279852
They love reading about it.	156.95542831219666
Man’s head found in a garden.	124.82650006104052
Her clothing
consisted of.	326.6272570909774
How she met her death.	150.68616781800966
Recent outrage.	266.01283497161296
The weapon used.	334.44937730866525
Murderer is still at large.	137.84771649210126
A shoelace.	464.672675952932
The body to be exhumed.	198.63895403694985
Murder will out.	79.37588608533122
Cramped in this carriage.	110.4034249547255
She mightn’t like me to come that way without
letting her know.	203.8048343742644
Must be careful about women.	227.82520931588874
Catch them once with
their pants down.	200.68880105114746
Never forgive you after.	165.81954266916213
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	516.005482176645
Dark poplars,
rare white forms.	730.5929625054921
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	613.3000373750319
Martin Cunningham put
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
his knee.	245.46312262474711
He stepped out.	160.55304099299545
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	471.01471998337536
Change that soap now.	131.23322817318436
Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	420.48081401002554
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
still held.	215.59982308394567
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	375.60547616994563
It’s all the same.	53.68068092900721
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	819.9120318604334
Pomp of death.	64.26641606711271
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	287.8451927466516
Who ate them?	158.50315846764784
Mourners coming out.	101.49770616955087
He followed his companions.	225.04949856778887
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them.	507.39644402184973
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
out the two wreaths.	243.44194769868307
He handed one to the boy.	106.06289096677418
Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?	171.0518075001256
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block.	611.5079609310458
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	467.3493879167051
Coffin now.	56.330396450281164
Got here before us, dead as he is.	136.833672252126
Horse looking round at
it with his plume skeowways.	225.31969447627534
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,
pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	311.22025432609735
Do they know what they cart out
here every day?	203.60938321703418
Then Mount
Jerome for the protestants.	288.32543322026874
Funerals all over the world everywhere
every minute.	218.3199144396959
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	247.61395586896074
Thousands every hour.	187.89574578278584
Too many in the world.	74.04142935051487
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	133.21570567843096
Leanjawed harpy,
hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	456.7815781338458
Girl’s face stained with dirt
and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to
cry.	198.39690191993557
Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.	232.88665667851544
So
much dead weight.	274.26948146478037
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	307.49934274778775
First
the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	105.90750257238287
Corny Kelleher and the boy
followed with their wreaths.	198.05977602220867
Who is that beside them?	108.19795596150833
Ah, the
brother-in-law.	91.01304359697964
All walked after.	134.4753504390606
Martin Cunningham whispered:
	434.3649366811444
—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	270.9006303956495
Mr Power whispered.	434.3649366811444
How so?	50.1242710750977
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	700.5245171098506
Had the
Queen’s hotel in Ennis.	179.22326961917523
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	145.63020746329417
—O God! Mr Power whispered.	931.1233492459675
First I heard of it.	132.83113176918394
Poisoned himself?	71.51370192134448
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards the cardinal’s mausoleum.	250.25657720943266
—Was he insured?	155.7600796091212
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	490.36480739282
But the policy was heavily
mortgaged.	301.61969807983303
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	219.26430619095726
—How many children did he leave?	218.66792503508702
Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.	177.63533003566351
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	533.0175751429539
Five young children.	174.2267708779609
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	340.5159129924396
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	636.3357644098745
Has the laugh at him now.	94.59083706295937
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	185.9608512834076
She had
outlived him.	191.6745869307391
Lost her husband.	101.83435681634637
More dead for her than for me.	111.98118411262952
One must
outlive the other.	178.11328472205457
Wise men say.	128.28946469438435
There are more women than men in the
world.	138.27300549619113
Condole with her.	42.60566835577214
Your terrible loss.	432.6299164170262
I hope you’ll soon follow
him.	247.99719381867985
For Hindu widows only.	494.1718442981488
She would marry another.	269.18454402058137
Yet who
knows after.	145.90559125884263
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	153.63759713740524
Drawn on
a guncarriage.	123.25338264940993
Victoria and Albert.	109.91965027550245
Frogmore memorial mourning.	591.6065446317908
But in
the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	150.03349101959859
Vain in her heart of
hearts.	107.72159095664432
All for a shadow.	79.35065354575792
Consort not even a king.	117.25326138230143
Her son was the
substance.	130.20072366538056
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
waiting.	165.62199437397229
It never comes.	159.15198170937447
—How are you, Simon?	155.50598321233358
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	473.9524129550617
Haven’t
seen you for a month of Sundays.	148.47537624360754
—Never better.	85.52706137596047
How are all in Cork’s own town?	185.0901963028492
—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
said.	372.8784625118033
Same old six and eightpence.	176.4658925128234
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	299.0772578449866
—And how is Dick, the solid man?	202.57203394967374
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	404.2843382080044
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	382.6322081927128
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead.	300.5074298405546
A few bob a skull.	222.06228078979893
Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up.	206.43448533178892
—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	537.5743859367369
Is that the eldest boy in front?	143.21602996747617
—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother.	190.08949943645902
John Henry Menton is
behind.	355.93093825022083
He put down his name for a quid.	129.02438662283234
—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	380.79108415878125
I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job.	263.76044575036985
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	117.12877001403047
—How did he lose it?	115.94248204759288
Ned Lambert asked.	255.87999104604643
Liquor, what?	42.76162057125033
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	168.03491803543326
Mr Bloom stood
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	318.4582027522932
Poor boy! Was
he there when the father?	145.50649473942275
Both unconscious.	317.52817152557833
Lighten up at the last
moment and recognise for the last time.	124.08772926773383
All he might have done.	121.18915255310662
I owe
three shillings to O’Grady.	504.20983217670573
Would he understand?	93.85868125826487
The mutes bore the
coffin into the chapel.	289.26187650996116
Which end is his head?	110.21726320111176
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light.	156.59472318158168
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners.	503.7396766669877
Always in front of us.	85.51136122629475
Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	370.9411239123886
The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	283.4875033484891
Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	330.6596132097535
He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	389.4594557836767
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door.	229.51276004958595
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with
one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s
belly.	308.5425206462553
Who’ll read the book?	126.28183995162189
I, said the rook.	118.0362337347859
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
with a fluent croak.	185.00736791811406
Father Coffey.	203.15938669399281
I knew his name was like a coffin.	129.69383468588177
_Dominenamine._ Bully
about the muzzle he looks.	198.5946615362332
Bosses the show.	58.07953723348339
Muscular christian.	177.7587345857907
Woe
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	414.88825807691495
Thou art Peter.	349.00368041760646
Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	261.0011862577635
With a belly on
him like a poisoned pup.	186.06233393669385
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	540.1678040104885
Hhhn:
burst sideways.	349.29534638493385
_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._
	1154.6485066515527
Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	249.43384421149392
Requiem
mass.	148.26478993325446
Crape weepers.	365.4416887200119
Blackedged notepaper.	266.01283497161296
Chilly place this.	114.51657977154096
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning
in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	188.8235480430964
Eyes of a
toad too.	104.8342024198611
What swells him up that way?	157.10303916529034
Molly gets swelled after
cabbage.	589.4393482377543
Air of the place maybe.	96.69664903231337
Looks full up of bad gas.	187.50283730254546
Must be an
infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	238.60209892753468
Butchers, for instance: they
get like raw beefsteaks.	298.07086082984597
Who was telling me?	105.4715827288251
Mervyn Browne.	203.15938669399281
Down in the
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn
it.	226.18558359995563
Out it rushes: blue.	203.84178292327982
One whiff of that and you’re a goner.	143.35313515576044
My kneecap is hurting me.	446.07038957963545
That’s better.	76.33066523219033
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s
bucket and shook it over the coffin.	138.63327583977141
Then he walked to the other end
and shook it again.	115.1031293290251
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	101.06979180377834
As
you were before you rested.	158.47225012023858
It’s all written down: he has to do it.	104.50387193998269
_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._
	792.1319400920594
The server piped the answers in the treble.	278.77367676114153
I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants.	227.1117590579296
Up to fifteen or so.	120.23262911056119
After that, of course
...	51.83729173617734
Holy water that was, I expect.	255.19384579388776
Shaking sleep out of it.	82.02272861919678
He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	238.08008851788696
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	152.4941506597608
All the year round he prayed the same
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	169.5687987826332
On Dignam
now.	210.0908667483094
_—In paradisum._
	395.30597590800915
Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	143.81628305867665
Says that over
everybody.	144.08948016941838
Tiresome kind of a job.	93.83768173071829
But he has to say something.	95.34431945964616
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	225.13611054223597
Corny
Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	245.01075398508902
Corny
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law.	149.61659855414132
All
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	198.00181267051846
Mr Bloom
came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	309.16088720896346
He gazed gravely at
the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	231.80511524937162
The metal
wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	401.93853167939665
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	262.3537305438982
Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.	605.5254306786842
—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	541.0637839875885
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	219.85831015068018
—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’.	150.44157438127888
But
his heart is buried in Rome.	187.19882248291344
How many broken hearts are buried here,
Simon!
	572.0404600081794
—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	378.57227153302307
I’ll soon be stretched
beside her.	289.68720689482336
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	631.0889738262204
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.	197.9175134649449
Mr Power took his arm.	242.44658441021852
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.	132.74522051943816
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	342.83401231840566
I suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.	140.0352696390765
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.	331.21406612184006
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	1201.8105598385403
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	310.165758142645
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	373.29367398703357
I suppose we can
do so too.	171.09992798254024
We are the last.	64.18197712200376
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	290.6618776183043
They covered their heads.	268.26224821714794
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?	254.857853767695
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	286.37371558453225
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	388.0070132783453
Secret
eyes, secretsearching.	326.97870459244774
Mason, I think: not sure.	278.7285633740171
Beside him again.	76.66758142174754
We
are the last.	64.18197712200376
In the same boat.	110.52443297388814
Hope he’ll say something else.	178.75069899737622
—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
impressive I must say.	493.20235916392016
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	820.3309728207613
The language of course was another thing.	152.11600199107798
Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
	257.2599260845919
—_I am the resurrection and the life_.	155.1254031241075
That touches a man’s inmost
heart.	265.9060341513975
—It does, Mr Bloom said.	381.168204339149
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
with his toes to the daisies?	178.9358762795702
No touching that.	125.22529026328489
Seat of the affections.	74.53806719839598
Broken heart.	86.90266822808451
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
every day.	367.1818506872479
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	198.3291107652401
Lots of
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	491.3268905917294
Old rusty pumps: damn
the thing else.	420.7984428907065
The resurrection and the life.	125.02989414681593
Once you are dead you
are dead.	132.10687416974162
That last day idea.	203.10859570179272
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	130.57995450122394
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	304.5526041450149
Find damn all of himself that morning.	128.58408008056585
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	132.43005815372936
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	651.9488480581838
Troy
measure.	196.39544749833223
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	335.8639489394119
—Everything went off A1, he said.	163.29929278022595
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	193.11869575217764
Policeman’s shoulders.	103.28325316698073
With
your tooraloom tooraloom.	298.90068102497145
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	260.1198059251471
Corny Kelleher said.	165.5081573229974
Mr Kernan assured him.	362.1042183478613
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	256.24280195228414
John Henry Menton asked.	470.39340133043726
I
know his face.	90.02699195747948
Ned Lambert glanced back.	374.1931155589155
—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
soprano.	300.554703355704
She’s his wife.	67.11673591112508
—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	312.2019071706771
I haven’t seen her for some
time.	192.71501806095162
She was a finelooking woman.	147.67167912306024
I danced with her, wait, fifteen
seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.	513.1659457398947
And a good
armful she was.	131.21199840968472
He looked behind through the others.	160.56381262247766
—What is he?	40.04036031893841
he asked.	66.98244490415372
What does he do?	96.843466434283
Wasn’t he in the stationery
line?	125.68685205876085
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	368.24381162333117
Ned Lambert smiled.	355.9068776154023
—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s.	117.67237307928083
A traveller for blottingpaper.	331.6293118069022
—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for?	314.7693491961652
She had plenty of game in her then.	149.55136541477737
—Has still, Ned Lambert said.	349.82173722308977
He does some canvassing for ads.	346.3259639600539
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.	553.182579688949
The barrow turned into a side lane.	293.27022176628236
A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage.	429.2026332335558
The gravediggers touched their caps.	493.8971508647021
—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	822.9995174961861
He never forgets a friend.	232.7541812583489
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence.	347.5191014201793
Mr Dedalus said:
	165.5081573229974
—I am come to pay you another visit.	222.38812446844392
—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	234.79043115880336
I don’t want
your custom at all.	190.6834105555673
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	424.2490586776914
—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	161.70828622396175
—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	272.93364009158864
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	347.20597870493526
The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	297.2640818570145
—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	188.16088016700056
They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	180.66302148946778
After
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	242.78887501108468
One of the
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	252.1297936060921
The other drunk was
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	258.0130013778032
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	236.1521938860584
He
resumed:
	266.0083962612288
—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
the man_, says he.	227.3372171462681
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	341.25908537750433
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
he walked.	307.3132171873689
—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	313.81677984546445
—I know, Hynes said.	188.03537377583842
I know that.	62.20832369207715
—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	325.2524285590416
It’s pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	300.03722185418127
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.	490.81609300590054
All want to be on
good terms with him.	117.79335699445137
Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.	723.7896404564751
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	268.8525799319526
No passout
checks.	1071.7664043766638
_Habeas corpus_.	464.672675952932
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	160.6566920991738
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
disturbed me writing to Martha?	399.3120216635098
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead
letter office.	155.43475840575206
Be the better of a shave.	85.34111453076935
Grey sprouting beard.	586.6959105235486
That’s
the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	165.06224014539825
And temper getting cross.	518.2111123607197
Silver threads among the grey.	264.71307858617445
Fancy being his wife.	108.85604480891253
Wonder he had the
gumption to propose to any girl.	163.4865945842636
Come out and live in the graveyard.	109.92855673448024
Dangle that before her.	71.93313322386138
It might thrill her first.	231.79856599710905
Courting death.	99.6064967734029
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	180.10855822830638
The
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	293.1020183981754
Will o’
the wisp.	133.63903489543333
Gas of graves.	121.09910641080984
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
all.	145.81313923342657
Women especially are so touchy.	354.58092006815974
Tell her a ghost story in bed to
make her sleep.	160.90491229861055
Have you ever seen a ghost?	156.77064841983474
Well, I have.	188.68260340478528
It was a
pitchdark night.	150.95981691687652
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	155.04726726536373
Still they’d
kiss all right if properly keyed up.	310.57772771687183
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	402.93789654472687
Learn anything if taken young.	240.19726568182477
Men like that.	51.054530641345096
Love among the tombstones.	200.3224634918776
Spice of pleasure.	80.06658588447696
In
the midst of death we are in life.	129.87540687609768
Both ends meet.	313.2215451628
Tantalising for the
poor dead.	83.74063619228873
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	231.4470419693398
Gnawing their
vitals.	234.45551074949512
Desire to grig people.	249.0664207962353
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	120.67001974036044
Eight children he has anyway.	201.38643784128624
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
after field.	293.297921084942
Holy fields.	196.39217042896712
More room if they buried them standing.	270.0830549973828
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t.	207.74491478512385
His head might come up some
day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	242.99454980511794
All honeycombed
the ground must be: oblong cells.	502.86051277445995
And very neat he keeps it too: trim
grass and edgings.	413.312910850715
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	1088.3010889759448
Well, so
it is.	62.47659873688108
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	115.80099062019677
Chinese cemeteries with giant
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	694.166111611421
The Botanic
Gardens are just over there.	306.1868960567018
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives
new life.	175.2681975258895
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	283.09106671997154
Every man his price.	136.9074053778259
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
invaluable for fruit garden.	1029.2013378825213
A bargain.	202.40474382541677
By carcass of William
Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds
thirteen and six.	728.4033336358187
With thanks.	125.16499985741288
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails.	483.25728694143567
Turning green and pink decomposing.	315.8075827217273
Rot
quick in damp earth.	264.98745883944895
The lean old ones tougher.	605.6847858153227
Then a kind of a
tallowy kind of a cheesy.	149.1546301306001
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing
out of them.	295.2570486757849
Then dried up.	228.4128251465607
Of course the cells or whatever
they are go on living.	218.64838225734772
Changing about.	52.40978887817269
Live for ever practically.	197.62197587260786
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	197.21770287776332
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	192.12582475786104
Soil must be simply
swirling with them.	210.2487255332367
Your head it simply swurls.	245.63350315009424
Those pretty little
seaside gurls.	599.7528881236847
He looks cheerful enough over it.	312.55860092940577
Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first.	166.63271612832386
Wonder how he looks at
life.	141.45144878185403
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	215.79638746536918
The one
about the bulletin.	139.12719689770975
Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m.	184.84583975990464
this morning.	81.35519500842032
11
p.m.	137.30576913945674
(closing time).	59.062705369918554
Not arrived yet.	455.48244380070366
The dead themselves the
men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s
in fashion.	190.88425539679992
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	558.6417298429857
Keep
out the damp.	101.2525172893647
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	211.25200110573138
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	119.91274847764197
Shows the profound knowledge of the human
heart.	164.21636125683307
Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least.	187.4391708779774
_De mortuis
nil nisi prius_.	2047.0774208136247
Go out of mourning first.	118.64774564546983
Hard to imagine his funeral.	142.43993082173844
Seems a sort of a joke.	102.32553625408768
Read your own obituary notice they say you live
longer.	373.86424317493623
Gives you second wind.	153.38494588004585
New lease of life.	178.7525271699567
—How many have you for tomorrow?	154.02158822975903
the caretaker asked.	212.32035563204948
—Two, Corny Kelleher said.	339.27239792854846
Half ten and eleven.	138.32165956310365
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	164.5190401504681
The barrow had ceased to
trundle.	413.42916847187604
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
stepping with care round the graves.	270.0157134063438
The gravediggers bore the coffin
and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	288.07323253892326
Burying him.	36.51091131766098
We come to bury Cæsar.	263.4010036953692
His ides of March or June.	434.8079154235031
He
doesn’t know who is here nor care.	253.21350637710447
Now who is that lankylooking galoot
over there in the macintosh?	207.9859847336977
Now who is he I’d like to know?	145.33584133883522
Now I’d
give a trifle to know who he is.	186.07145633299422
Always someone turns up you never
dreamt of.	230.83283023512865
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	198.62114558224653
Yes, he
could.	55.0063588381183
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though
he could dig his own grave.	215.27969538663163
We all do.	68.462782239601
Only man buries.	261.8054247693963
No, ants too.	363.7856631479687
First thing strikes anybody.	433.1724228021294
Bury the dead.	50.32455395564331
Say Robinson Crusoe was
true to life.	276.7501270853593
Well then Friday buried him.	270.1894647332961
Every Friday buries a
Thursday if you come to look at it.	218.93176723257014
O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
	471.6004597942724
How could you possibly do so?	162.84788088564054
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	246.5536048284032
When you think of
them all it does seem a waste of wood.	166.25215194979893
All gnawed through.	353.8412868895882
They could
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
way.	261.34112670488133
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.	169.86955917959074
They’re so particular.	216.54470520446117
Lay me in my native earth.	170.88516355163583
Bit of clay from the
holy land.	135.2954138914683
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
coffin.	203.01111225761946
I see what it means.	124.07186913842474
To protect him as long as possible
even in the earth.	179.08020186415246
The Irishman’s house is his coffin.	183.93245382416964
Embalming in
catacombs, mummies the same idea.	286.6957273903894
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	271.61128128164484
The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	176.5801448967147
Death’s number.	91.39335097836972
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	142.92526745690864
He wasn’t in the
chapel, that I’ll swear.	264.42421910168196
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	343.9292773348716
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	426.553109751535
Tinge of purple.	93.4968808990673
I had
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	212.24308101619894
Dressy fellow he
was once.	102.56569644200654
Used to change three suits in the day.	138.5367523928222
Must get that grey
suit of mine turned by Mesias.	257.6915173505499
It’s dyed.	162.50633252106766
His wife I forgot he’s
not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
him.	272.13125576186724
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
gravetrestles.	323.0586436621645
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	177.88620729409837
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	275.5994778150513
Far away a donkey brayed.	357.86033120202
No such ass.	280.15050702325266
Never see a dead one, they
say.	117.4055995647538
Shame of death.	64.26641606711271
They hide.	167.4807545852914
Also poor papa went away.	272.40334032462124
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	284.58882626408337
The
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
the black open space.	279.88938580397723
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
caretaker.	570.7040951137832
Wellcut frockcoat.	249.71993668557914
Weighing them up perhaps to see which
will go next.	174.7757323558244
Well, it is a long rest.	95.85019034467253
Feel no more.	84.04055748121733
It’s the moment
you feel.	86.0854424239615
Must be damned unpleasant.	318.197632004295
Can’t believe it at first.	124.09066564805256
Mistake
must be: someone else.	235.60477734997625
Try the house opposite.	105.61834759633129
Wait, I wanted to.	194.33978773145492
I
haven’t yet.	255.3003922513896
Then darkened deathchamber.	824.7533730312146
Light they want.	92.28956219768608
Whispering
around you.	99.43208302296745
Would you like to see a priest?	88.48108780754242
Then rambling and
wandering.	290.15537101486996
Delirium all you hid all your life.	156.57632802232635
The death struggle.	383.9809776425559
His
sleep is not natural.	183.11706358281123
Press his lower eyelid.	253.26991125840516
Watching is his nose
pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	235.28422124837522
Pull the
pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed.	176.69124224718828
Devil in
that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman.	161.42125725307545
Dying to embrace
her in his shirt.	118.48125608340344
Last act of _Lucia.	193.95765238977123
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	1539.0761885682555
Bam! He expires.	857.7157624187907
Gone at last.	83.91474281185103
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	147.74269608696247
Don’t forget to pray for him.	136.84684656911574
Remember him in your prayers.	126.40555073724546
Even
Parnell.	203.15938669399281
Ivy day dying out.	167.66124999339706
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one
after the other.	190.93224096172227
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	158.39516157996775
Hoping you’re well and
not in hell.	110.31672999532478
Nice change of air.	121.80028920890244
Out of the fryingpan of life into the
fire of purgatory.	133.1550138119183
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	135.7632541438017
They say you do
when you shiver in the sun.	130.8444643783278
Someone walking over it.	118.17170478013237
Callboy’s warning.	146.15013956590622
Near you.	32.76073075102579
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	401.09454809405224
Mamma,
poor mamma, and little Rudy.	276.95497396372997
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
on the coffin.	277.87297643417384
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	229.3365987959428
And if he was alive all
the time?	93.48087880135758
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
course.	275.05062405506277
Of course he is dead.	106.2467960870318
Monday he died.	85.79758874980416
They ought to have some
law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a
telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	220.66481568512742
Flag of
distress.	155.25731673228717
Three days.	99.21513207755018
Rather long to keep them in summer.	137.71804880834563
Just as well
to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.	144.01805438968137
The clay fell softer.	564.909275895787
Begin to be forgotten.	99.17825288931199
Out of sight, out of mind.	103.18340657540244
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	227.016611967593
Had enough of
it.	68.00355219387073
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
without show.	359.7288535689836
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
its way deftly through the maze of graves.	279.2886815933579
Quietly, sure of his ground,
he traversed the dismal fields.	256.03308909114423
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	267.579027997059
Ah, the names.	73.78044854543552
But he
knows them all.	94.29341905881036
No: coming to me.	79.68149078518995
—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	293.4580122355156
What is your
christian name?	183.1671824650938
I’m not sure.	136.05388427468145
—L, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too.	259.74156006717453
He
asked me to.	74.64826107999149
—Charley, Hynes said writing.	287.2028780691116
I know.	62.35918204518505
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	115.05714154498584
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	182.80799888172047
Good
idea a postmortem for doctors.	308.53064378473084
Find out what they imagine they know.	147.66120009828867
He
died of a Tuesday.	136.07558197991688
Got the run.	62.45036919566268
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	124.57945979208878
Charley, you’re my darling.	156.4874955050023
That was why he asked me to.	86.64787947199814
O well, does
no harm.	231.76245617999106
I saw to that, M’Coy.	228.04308513795564
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	328.27452012517705
Leave
him under an obligation: costs nothing.	377.7551405059092
—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
over there in the...	122.66215517862699
He looked around.	195.79608594677632
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	400.1923875250498
Where is he now?	61.384250693482485
—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	580.8872056857792
I don’t know who he is.	106.46788808826044
Is that his
name?	62.8648188263116
He moved away, looking about him.	204.09918119058133
—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	540.7944552413234
I say, Hynes!
	236.29772526129597
Didn’t hear.	106.05467584614718
Where has he disappeared to?	123.19136033607982
Not a sign.	84.36362076378113
Well of all
the.	29.794282411471933
Has anybody here seen?	283.51964882442945
Kay ee double ell.	753.7570937397795
Become invisible.	191.01580163668595
Good
Lord, what became of him?	185.60902059691296
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	709.9152170047603
—O, excuse me!
	146.07364304325833
He stepped aside nimbly.	587.669727530878
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	197.7177677089741
It rose.	108.19094078438673
Nearly over.	56.2025789643362
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
their spades.	468.479221928793
All uncovered again for a few instants.	286.65367214560644
The boy propped
his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump.	203.5138019236584
The
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
the barrow.	393.30932955575906
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	313.89699824834406
One
bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	266.5521916557825
One, leaving his
mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	623.3618894669514
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	274.11787646358704
His navelcord.	317.5334699131929
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	248.9921340109
Sorry, sir: trouble.	186.31913420432485
I know that.	62.20832369207715
For
yourselves just.	354.17548792304945
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	483.66935295427123
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said.	209.29398109083988
We have time.	82.95408542435189
—Let us, Mr Power said.	337.41917269759267
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	207.80498028589963
With awe Mr
Power’s blank voice spoke:
	670.6827736598417
—Some say he is not in that grave at all.	98.42681162915179
That the coffin was filled
with stones.	170.50668750146258
That one day he will come again.	135.52643976528938
Hynes shook his head.	141.37944250142687
—Parnell will never come again, he said.	127.14525086058529
He’s there, all that was
mortal of him.	90.33988335842375
Peace to his ashes.	92.00746120395769
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
old Ireland’s hearts and hands.	840.0028746480157
More sensible to spend the money on
some charity for the living.	223.97411912960115
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	68.06763711647564
Does
anybody really?	313.09534031746654
Plant him and have done with him.	83.12600444738328
Like down a
coalshoot.	161.7208678248939
Then lump them together to save time.	245.84973081918903
All souls’ day.	196.40785101549162
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave.	202.52457833011758
Ten shillings for the gardener.	154.541489985788
He
keeps it free of weeds.	243.22214125727137
Old man himself.	104.32711106949154
Near death’s door.	131.37594064001368
Who passed away.	155.18439467034307
Who departed this
life.	258.4838321602408
As if they did it of their own accord.	145.89681905852302
Got the shove, all of
them.	86.43127670787032
Who kicked the bucket.	187.26764202937233
More interesting if they told you what
they were.	157.96536529552486
So and So, wheelwright.	334.7580868409822
I travelled for cork lino.	515.3312702903586
I paid
five shillings in the pound.	195.3037816596514
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	245.4889178876868
Entered into rest
the protestants put it.	175.90237348903065
Old Dr Murren’s.	293.4159458315134
The great physician called him
home.	329.6919421149356
Well it’s God’s acre for them.	171.3822194999294
Nice country residence.	305.745479208564
Newly
plastered and painted.	282.64782235482636
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the
_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	317.6615514291935
Better value that for the money.	109.42943128083638
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	200.57832082818115
The other gets rather tiresome,
never withering.	613.2679560637089
Expresses nothing.	94.48607593588714
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	684.3777725818173
Like stuffed.	266.01283497161296
Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	431.1691183885101
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	165.86623669404116
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	193.66940799206532
Dead animal even
sadder.	549.023457695732
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	307.8176979466051
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	255.259299483873
Heart on his sleeve.	105.13452767074425
Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	193.16190915955045
Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that.	145.6089713418874
Seems anything but pleased.	238.91954840043098
Why this
infliction?	297.80738663848274
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
boy.	169.69347144749509
Apollo that was.	39.74782755067457
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	503.162241510441
Faithful departed.	236.72887101340675
As you are now so once were we.	142.3131991825797
Besides how could you remember everybody?	226.0399758763113
Eyes, walk, voice.	168.43278778982537
Well, the
voice, yes: gramophone.	152.59170908572793
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
the house.	139.36932109298516
After dinner on a Sunday.	178.1509196721109
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	216.35125939556133
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
hellohello amawf krpthsth.	3129.6766389984527
Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face.	98.3008490591881
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after
fifteen years, say.	215.3701357698973
For instance who?	166.58766146997522
For instance some fellow that
died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.	304.0286235134455
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	428.1957653528794
He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	369.1237967615802
There he
goes.	84.74824631783308
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
pebbles.	394.68284295224197
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	330.60490468333285
The grey
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	359.8315387731438
Good hidingplace for treasure.	493.96329107905154
Who lives there?	151.27024770782845
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	293.84052290899314
Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he?	313.29969059598164
Making his rounds.	144.42431831288786
Tail gone now.	129.12681345959155
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	183.42628942969228
Pick the bones
clean no matter who it was.	154.93860148749195
Ordinary meat for them.	128.06229570527864
A corpse is meat
gone bad.	357.9069009967158
Well and what’s cheese?	97.45351765435367
Corpse of milk.	72.86875894147364
I read in that
_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
corpse.	211.32155768875802
Cremation better.	85.52706137596047
Priests dead against it.	127.76860321981836
Devilling for the
other firm.	98.51543473206318
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	1095.342242841372
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	266.62951708644687
Lethal chamber.	181.77345928489532
Ashes to
ashes.	112.62119440451862
Or bury at sea.	228.04078235857472
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	202.86846121283276
Eaten by
birds.	143.7506075808257
Earth, fire, water.	193.49965161341126
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	134.43735759871615
See
your whole life in a flash.	162.28491878183883
But being brought back to life no.	161.5115089256456
Can’t
bury in the air however.	153.27589837936569
Out of a flying machine.	152.37296489888848
Wonder does the news
go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	217.66026042749587
Underground communication.	317.5334699131929
We learned that from them.	132.22852262872453
Wouldn’t be surprised.	165.10155376709713
Regular square feed
for them.	216.73140618374734
Flies come before he’s well dead.	132.7580583448231
Got wind of Dignam.	180.57449856861692
They
wouldn’t care about the smell of it.	129.9729567107489
Saltwhite crumbling mush of
corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	834.4239338076775
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	430.8840548602514
Back to the world again.	64.64813578656438
Enough of this place.	79.6116021374999
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	160.8342786455044
Last time I
was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.	319.09396166956896
Poor papa too.	189.03904409654427
The love that kills.	186.7407711772783
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I
read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
gravesores.	328.70390038524073
Give you the creeps after a bit.	110.13378751195796
I will appear to you after
death.	172.23026618529067
You will see my ghost after death.	219.85961420610118
My ghost will haunt you after
death.	319.03278163251576
There is another world after death named hell.	313.64962272051264
I do not like
that other world she wrote.	153.40570701044405
No more do I.	225.07030090408867
Plenty to see and hear and
feel yet.	112.23791924841913
Feel live warm beings near you.	353.401762744724
Let them sleep in their
maggoty beds.	297.9540464087027
They are not going to get me this innings.	184.12381545698705
Warm beds:
warm fullblooded life.	637.1572734230899
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	554.9629556532693
Solicitor, I think.	272.42615053825347
I know his face.	90.02699195747948
Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	701.5946463432315
Dignam used to be in his office.	98.45609761708904
Mat Dillon’s long ago.	229.69317260701507
Jolly Mat.	203.15938669399281
Convivial evenings.	216.98608446976067
Cold fowl,
cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	597.429667859663
Heart of gold really.	126.2245291923613
Yes, Menton.	203.15938669399281
Got
his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
him.	306.10902232107725
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	265.3211302409043
Why he took such a rooted dislike to
me.	192.42200931116867
Hate at first sight.	154.30273889911382
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the
lilactree, laughing.	419.3866348972811
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are
by.	210.22732749073427
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	97.0357534823708
Carriage probably.	135.4939018501051
—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	321.20539369975387
They stopped.	132.91603643076527
—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	345.96947247176644
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	373.6800981487626
—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	864.4078047994038
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	343.0312983766
He clapped the hat on his head
again.	144.5780063743493
—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	220.09106878414462
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	419.49624006897506
—Thank you, he said shortly.	108.75082080006695
They walked on towards the gates.	158.2150308698382
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
few paces so as not to overhear.	417.87923122629195
Martin laying down the law.	173.91815616985056
Martin
could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
seeing it.	215.1423512919129
Oyster eyes.	62.2820201442977
Never mind.	97.66251520250705
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	239.28603922356317
Get the pull over him that way.	109.47290397719593
Thank you.	32.76073075102579
How grand we are this morning!

IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
	1364.292885274888
Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross.	1055.4060079617786
The hoarse Dublin United
Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:
	880.3045182391896
—Rathgar and Terenure!
	109.91965027550245
—Come on, Sandymount Green!
	308.9031732751154
Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a
singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided
parallel.	438.1795623962378
—Start, Palmerston Park!
	494.0867752080217
THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
	1005.9497775117529
Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
polished.	268.8786878402667
Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion
mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	543.7862138780182
R., received
loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	919.1335235526302
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
	770.5244035147354
Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores
and bumped them up on the brewery float.	406.77270054584386
On the brewery float bumped
dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s
stores.	633.9908653715148
—There it is, Red Murray said.	208.1037019597511
Alexander Keyes.	203.15938669399281
—Just cut it out, will you?	116.59754871692041
Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to
the _Telegraph_ office.	224.42914254756573
The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again.	281.79910864583996
Davy Stephens, minute in
a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out
with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.	345.70419571917904
Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the
newspaper in four clean strokes.	346.0307164319324
Scissors and paste.	130.66522969128042
—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
square.	350.3749390649262
—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
his ear, we can do him one.	279.76565211812533
—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	257.3922765702331
I’ll rub that in.	136.36187379048113
WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
	1201.6266902949878
Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:
	378.4637717625279
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.	400.9784165361515
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels.	280.8710082853819
It passed statelily up the staircase,
steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	413.0837140444848
The broadcloth back
ascended each step: back.	687.1374779935385
All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
Simon Dedalus says.	212.80774335706815
Fat folds of neck,
fat, neck, fat, neck.	447.831623677398
—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	210.29259102958827
Red Murray whispered.	434.3649366811444
The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree.	476.0720289009852
They always build
one door opposite another for the wind to.	219.59108644498653
Way out.	43.961956629777546
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	454.1392232362486
Mary, Martha.	203.15938669399281
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	272.56087823246105
—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	427.7573104541747
—Yes, Red Murray agreed.	796.2865872714857
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
Saviour.	188.6689031764793
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	599.9588659389912
Hand on his
heart.	71.94895206957297
In _Martha._
	137.22421879471196
Co-ome thou lost one,
	376.1592007841996
Co-ome thou dear one!
	380.8787116155483
THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
	1005.9497775117529
—His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	621.2449625665286
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	456.74039871872765
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
stepped off posthaste with a word:
	322.7232257934935
_—Freeman!_
	137.22421879471196
Mr Bloom said slowly:
	245.46281866817915
—Well, he is one of our saviours also.	153.76016987965812
But will he save the circulation?	148.76568392662614
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
packing paper.	505.535933866348
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
Nannetti’s reading closet.	319.3069136669849

Like these, got out of hand:
fermenting.	220.46079890536143
Working away, tearing away.	311.36030926057924
And that old grey rat tearing
to get in.	203.25548388460192
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
	1500.5868986082914
Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy
crown.	488.17806589342763
Strange he never saw his real country.	176.41152192501866
Ireland my country.	119.58906716676198

I’d like
that part.	138.09173909781896
Learn a lot teaching others.	277.45991293950806
The personal note.	358.72454619080406

Two bridegrooms

Cuprani too, printer.	262.35095005398193
More Irish than
the Irish.	251.5987264440647
The machines clanked in threefour time.	563.5761090504097
Thump, thump, thump.	706.5034018073485
Now if he
got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on
and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	154.46091559394696
Monkeydoodle
the whole thing.	87.39088398433329
Want a cool head.	122.76170723703362
—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	272.8300037669804
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	225.40311109795968
Long John is backing him, they say.	257.9903608555852
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the
sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	236.6446892074253
He handed the sheet silently
over the dirty glass screen.	348.0380609748014
—Did you?	32.76073075102579
Hynes asked.	75.71580409413632
—Mm, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
Look sharp and you’ll catch him.	160.05000182659873
I’ll tap him too.	158.50198468175267
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.	350.0010985018238
Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s.	293.1450848727965
Three weeks.	174.05701931214955
Third hint.	287.40150812754337
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
	1201.6266902949878
Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.	471.0805214156119
—Excuse me, councillor, he said.	114.89393252350749
This ad, you see.	133.65102718880036
Keyes, you remember?	90.02715305543849
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	420.7271781342402
—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	275.5864827705387
—But wait, Mr Bloom said.	375.04999556094543
He wants it changed.	201.40287425186867
Keyes, you see.	60.92039389475258
He wants
two keys at the top.	191.145006251897
Hell of a racket they make.	128.1539734933542
He doesn’t hear it.	161.222078468178
Iron nerves.	209.19873405380028
Maybe he understands what I.	261.88029779963335
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	337.2579975737183
—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	300.07529703712663
Let him take that in first.	89.53680228813128
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	323.4466541431518
Clank it.	30.60773084408939
Clank it.	30.60773084408939
Miles
of it unreeled.	114.34047846613592
What becomes of it after?	107.52398399159088
O, wrap up meat, parcels:
various uses, thousand and one things.	550.6136633255584
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	283.10083386658323
—Like that, see.	58.405363777980696
Two crossed keys here.	318.3306240758842
A circle.	164.52428259081285
Then here the name.	70.83743547683075
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	482.4646682239104
So on.	32.610077424956444
Better not teach him his own business.	195.31965479002258
—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	252.470999508031
Then round the top
in leaded: the house of keys.	147.64421189724973
You see?	56.50786883456539
Do you think that’s a good idea?	101.50119832277828
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
there quietly.	356.1291554016516
—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	220.40447511508026
You know, councillor,
the Manx parliament.	353.33715624938867
Innuendo of home rule.	151.2742686543174
Tourists, you know, from
the isle of Man.	138.2186354882694
Catches the eye, you see.	73.98080971488992
Can you do that?	61.065826000423485
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him.	256.7626032381716
Better not.	43.63875407829325
—We can do that, the foreman said.	112.17009502822957
Have you the design?	78.27062229586166
—I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	263.3454896464052
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	119.32721962382193
He has a
house there too.	112.13724597385698
I’ll just run out and ask him.	165.5422418759822
Well, you can do that
and just a little par calling attention.	192.3823569284486
You know the usual.	91.97752883749533
Highclass
licensed premises.	411.54087837289353
So on.	32.610077424956444
The foreman thought for an instant.	250.37070503218317
—We can do that, he said.	79.29217812935029
Let him give us a three months’ renewal.	237.6038597819121
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	429.4792257820843
He began to check it
silently.	249.61676227462974
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,
watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	445.1057868071468
Want to be sure of his spelling.	117.85028340104324
Proof fever.	226.026831156834
Martin Cunningham forgot
to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning.	413.2989479963239
It is amusing to
view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it?	479.4715287525407

pear under a cemetery wall.	443.4182516813874
Silly, isn’t it?	123.12073258088616
Cemetery put in of course
on account of the symmetry.	103.3009703526525
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	199.53154772803097
Thank you.	32.76073075102579
I ought to
have said something about an old hat or something.	166.5698497279799
I could have
said.	91.54026451105744
Looks as good as new now.	130.04877783752656
See his phiz then.	190.04517536550702
The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its
flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers.	499.37819352702536
Almost
human the way it sllt to call attention.	195.67755050197886
Doing its level best to speak.	231.76818265172366
That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut.	360.8955234222617
Everything speaks in

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
	1005.9497775117529
The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
	452.0409323760632
Where’s the archbishop’s letter?	112.56219022247807
It’s to be repeated in the
_Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?	124.3143386389116
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	353.9232761832319
—Monks, sir?	71.8721773002824
a voice asked from the castingbox.	175.38241388082216
Where’s Monks?	136.70385447397808
Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	269.5585046255884
Time to get out.	67.65724407750821
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
Three months’ renewal.	434.05420930527384
Want to get some wind off my chest first.	208.9036142382153
Try it
anyhow.	98.54901142726885
Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month.	450.11180630027366
Tourists over for the show.	80.58279890709771
A DAYFATHER
	203.15938669399281
He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,
spectacled, aproned.	420.8882640911116
Old Monks, the dayfather.	234.8901962963197
Queer lot of stuff he
must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’
ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	488.3229992195071
Nearing the end of his
tether now.	105.22245709116879
Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say.	231.91844977168296
Wife a good cook and washer.	199.70374203895588
Daughter working the machine in the
parlour.	161.05362171995344
Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.	496.60018630931523
AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
	1500.5868986082914
He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	378.4442597974515
Reads it backwards first.	201.7617372059989
Quickly he does it.	69.02683822144894
Must require some
practice that.	365.96813959791604

Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading
backwards with his finger to me.	269.23994124166984
Next year in Jerusalem.	192.49013348132254
Dear,
O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of
Egypt and into the house of bondage _alleluia.	228.0146414811991
Shema Israel Adonai
Elohenu_.	770.5244035147354
No, that’s the other.	46.12017373577831
Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons.	302.1287240610592
And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water
and the butcher.	85.89724009552883
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he
kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	183.71572505249574
Sounds a bit silly till you
come to look into it well.	159.77663948050198
Justice it means but it’s everybody eating
everyone else.	294.27713312384884
That’s what life is after all.	99.98270914136738
How quickly he does that
job.	164.48891166887867
Practice makes perfect.	303.7327285908409
Seems to see with his fingers.	80.53161081824074
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
the landing.	195.44256191071705
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch
him out perhaps.	174.4765260351799
Better phone him up first.	202.80713401990712
Same as
Citron’s house.	161.87106098892332
Twentyeight double four.	232.66569856140728
ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
	1005.9497775117529
He went down the house staircase.	160.05008073365786
Who the deuce scrawled all over those
walls with matches?	346.44264625854476
Looks as if they did it for a bet.	112.63298576680408
Heavy greasy
smell there always is in those works.	248.62624487092734
Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door
when I was there.	296.06117372559333
He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.	198.6286011613235
Ah, the soap
I put there.	199.056352907295
Lose it out of that pocket.	73.6076237184378
Putting back his handkerchief
he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
of his trousers.	203.74948628749897
What perfume does your wife use?	321.9254704337437
I could go home still: tram: something
I forgot.	463.2885045987202
Just to see: before: dressing.	154.67510018810486
A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	400.94440834827816
Know who that is.	63.79642762896466
What’s up?	50.05224885568234
Pop in a minute to phone.	126.39121331160541
Ned Lambert it
is.	125.98829165910159
He entered softly.	323.41045661725343
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
	1364.292885274888
—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
the dusty windowpane.	746.0806761435492
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing
face, asked of it sourly:
	418.8742741501757
—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	260.9112464535987
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
	189.6494495649338
—_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast
o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the
forest_.	495.9228973118682
What about that, Simon?	149.4490831735868
he asked over the fringe of his
newspaper.	139.3466972278832
How’s that for high?	73.58727274245273
—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	292.4373002948558
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
	369.09822180150167
—_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	404.71318064232753
O boys! O boys!
	478.5836711004029
—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	249.37230166788578
—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	227.41846381521074
I don’t want to
hear any more of the stuff.	139.83363697007331
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	281.8692376440339
High falutin stuff.	706.7393794977551
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	265.49411571437093
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does.	206.28950754142747
He has influence they say.	189.87803760315475
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his
greatgranduncle.	298.38241691249357
Close on ninety they say.	183.98773538373044
Living to spite them.	131.58709647794157
Might go first
himself.	152.57916464915726
Johnny, make room for your uncle.	236.6627760459816
The right honourable Hedges
Eyre Chatterton.	734.0050547308869
Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on
gale days.	387.4788433437849
Windfall when he kicks out.	155.8124248039506
—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	571.4206976332749
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
_Our lovely land_.	457.3443375173225
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
	1005.9497775117529
—Whose land?	100.87988756682225
Mr Bloom said simply.	253.95147320236012
—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	305.56925133637685
With an
accent on the whose.	141.87115622959908
—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.	400.8663140209268
—Is it his speech last night?	142.99025395908853
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
Ned Lambert nodded.	445.68207858654915
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
pushed in.	208.69150537771714
—Excuse me, J.	176.19100763337974
O’Molloy said, entering.	339.2641106709621
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	738.1817720091037
—I beg yours, he said.	196.13059849405545
—Good day, Jack.	238.40720467682863
—Come in.	24.26587054336645
Come in.	24.26587054336645
—Good day.	68.03423360298575
—How are you, Dedalus?	155.50598321233358
And yourself?	131.67126082267887
O’Molloy shook his head.	259.0933058797605
Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	147.0637818399677
Decline, poor chap.	172.19363642514153
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	532.2381918399983
Touch and go with him.	62.31578702358988
What’s
in the wind, I wonder.	134.1349984345397
Money worry.	365.4355909322164
—_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._
	295.60966258279956
—You’re looking extra.	346.24637828432435
—Is the editor to be seen?	94.43158248265244
O’Molloy asked, looking towards the
inner door.	297.54122765308813
—Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	252.55812745799912
To be seen and heard.	116.21970626392482
He’s in
his sanctum with Lenehan.	156.62824846877612
O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
pink pages of the file.	246.66627882615808
Practice dwindling.	365.4416887200119
A mighthavebeen.	464.672675952932
Losing heart.	86.90266822808451
Debts of
honour.	83.24477055097132
Reaping the whirlwind.	123.67355078555995
Used to get good retainers from D.	266.4906999482344
and
T.	203.15938669399281
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	223.7004555195226
Brains on their
sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	185.46027184643302
Believe he does some literary work
for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	277.9129416354989
Wellread fellow.	83.79921129302102
Myles Crawford
began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer
about when they get wind of a new opening.	280.63749278075244
Hot and cold
in the same breath.	93.47144009789645
Wouldn’t know which to believe.	123.3552960429924
One story good till
you hear the next.	182.46719245469424
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then
all blows over.	175.83676427924468
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	203.56857151203647
—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	584.9471354861505
_Or again if we
but climb the serried mountain peaks..._
	295.60966258279956
—Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	190.698581852033
Enough of the inflated
windbag!
	190.6832157903279
—_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
souls, as it were..._
	319.173124497998
—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	272.0537324739535
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	418.2069672372054
Is he
taking anything for it?	112.27265206262432
_—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio,
unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._
	727.2550349268339
HIS NATIVE DORIC
	494.0867752080217
—The moon, professor MacHugh said.	329.24886550498627
He forgot Hamlet.	415.644737181749
_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._
	382.3330768633615
—O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	680.7848866765937
Life is too short.	132.9485322000177
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	408.36289292449
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	517.0063929733831
—Doughy Daw! he cried.	189.25770811786535
WHAT WETHERUP SAID
	494.0867752080217
All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
cake that stuff.	282.2828948961016
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he?	156.32750715807973
Why they
call him Doughy Daw.	298.4112976016604
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	254.16027818434915
Daughter engaged
to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	236.67245384532308
Hooked that
nicely.	142.7603956694768
Open house.	78.1634037393583
Big blowout.	365.4355909322164
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	120.07801902926721
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	419.80240914858865
The bold blue eyes stared
about them and the harsh voice asked:
	272.15943983020765
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
grandly.	516.3204350043338
—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	224.0800657491503
—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	350.8251201816633
I must get a drink
after that.	128.81277874588835
—Drink! the editor cried.	113.96306552392845
No drinks served before mass.	564.0646517214125
—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	292.615140914975
Come on, Ned.	146.0554807867269
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	284.4594015588381
The editor’s blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.	417.0906464274965
—Will you join us, Myles?	326.22615149199254
Ned Lambert asked.	255.87999104604643
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
	494.0867752080217
—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	373.3730101189674
We
won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
	529.3990142260639
—Where was that, Myles?	117.7086484191082
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
his toecaps.	321.1347799645253
—In Ohio! the editor shouted.	286.22331910220504
—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	516.4621866089411
Passing out he whispered to J.	162.8896705211346
O’Molloy:
	203.15938669399281
—Incipient jigs.	464.672675952932
Sad case.	100.87820500642488
—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	328.006161330617
My Ohio!
	203.15938669399281
—A perfect cretic! the professor said.	256.99258711762934
Long, short and long.	113.17116693507779
O, HARP EOLIAN!
	494.0867752080217
He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
unwashed teeth.	343.62753936910906
—Bingbang, bangbang.	464.672675952932
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	313.3724632301991
—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	191.8737232285381
I just want to phone about an ad.	246.57601897435796
He went in.	62.493559461517876
—What about that leader this evening?	210.8977421403066
professor MacHugh asked, coming
to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	205.98925472438106
—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	330.69591899764686
Never you fret.	213.3745770827411
Hello, Jack.	203.15938669399281
That’s all right.	71.46889546300201
—Good day, Myles, J.	446.09104737442743
O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file.	308.8553610455986
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	333.4222260886647
The telephone whirred inside.	708.3665361724052
No, twenty...	144.64764396939395
Double four...	96.20811568147619
SPOT THE WINNER
	494.0867752080217
Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues.	195.54420410759502
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	257.5332095462195
he asked.	66.98244490415372
Sceptre with O.	139.89404219474883
Madden up.	45.161717238889764
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	121.90036272284686
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
flung open.	215.75309816481007
—Hush, Lenehan said.	165.5081573229974
I hear feetstoops.	405.9433641066505
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps.	230.9843273805689
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	260.4444844840704
—It wasn’t me, sir.	176.6368731662566
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	170.05559525452958
—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	100.11356568866877
There’s a hurricane
blowing.	208.7468566992544
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
stooped twice.	250.54702390726356
—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	189.8184674959342
It was Pat
Farrell shoved me, sir.	395.9655552614834
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	269.2343973003221
—Him, sir.	71.8721773002824
—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	205.64195726741744
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	162.92714664909053
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
	596.0425859974362
—Continued on page six, column four.	367.5766928012971
—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	633.4739097516558
Is the boss...?	94.05665598335273
To where?	61.93026000055078
Aha! Which auction
rooms?...	804.9096581319112
Aha! I see...	210.53190484335914
I’ll catch him.	157.72033477291214
A COLLISION ENSUES
	494.0867752080217
The bell whirred again as he rang off.	322.8656551501379
He came in quickly and bumped
against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	264.8486208937307
—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
making a grimace.	349.83339342358425
—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	608.509442774939
Are you hurt?	128.49083323729025
I’m in a
hurry.	98.26598853046129
—Knee, Lenehan said.	165.5081573229974
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
	348.36492902737075
—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	321.1726319235437
—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	183.15774353751465
O’Molloy
slapped the heavy pages over.	370.62405282063884
The noise of two shrill voices, a
mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on
the doorsteps:
	344.03567012746316
We are the boys of Wexford
	126.4580441434173
Who fought with heart and hand.	157.26320114736504
EXIT BLOOM
	203.15938669399281
—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
ad of Keyes’s.	311.18320997014297
Want to fix it up.	115.39159530869912
They tell me he’s round there in
Dillon’s.	123.45901900809399
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	229.6643587892253
—Begone! he said.	39.595082423913524
The world is before you.	111.68578748159716
—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	291.57272435695404
O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.	380.9854909537852
—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	277.0548154533591
Look at the young scamps
after him.	144.95203742252968
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	132.07878824781577
A STREET CORTÈGE
	494.0867752080217
Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots.	341.12790138874254
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
and you’ll kick.	235.29949533983842
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
walk.	391.6025421946315
Small nines.	365.4416887200119
Steal upon larks.	403.08931844487245
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
feet past the fireplace to J.	376.00132353281396
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands.	286.6848863949727
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
Myles Crawford said with a start.	163.07510509561985
Where are the other two
gone?	109.71240971992944
the professor said, turning.	167.46848925723708
They’re gone round to the Oval for a
drink.	155.68486537884317
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	319.1701217661581
Came over last night.	143.49202929485253
—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	238.7953373796016
Where’s my hat?	85.23226047703203
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	279.8201550319886
They jingled then in the
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	201.8846862841996
—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	195.7958242500438
—Seems to be, J.	116.5085455569715
O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	251.85806502778172
Who has the
most matches?	159.36049636293637
THE CALUMET OF PEACE
	770.5244035147354
He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	144.0486277157769
Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	268.5412492106176
O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	244.78281551529054
—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	692.1123655937956
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	259.21471405312485
He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
	613.0527870305721
’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
	419.7057687346011
’Twas empire charmed thy heart.	628.301597159869
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	462.7309125551916
You bloody old Roman empire?	422.3191264318162
Myles Crawford said.	165.5081573229974
He took a cigarette from the open case.	152.68439120972266
Lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:
	185.22944130061862
—Silence for my brandnew riddle!
	266.06166066876204
—_Imperium romanum_, J.	857.7253042844771
O’Molloy said gently.	270.2002682062468
It sounds nobler than
British or Brixton.	718.6088432725836
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	208.99675220109884
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	472.71089875746355
—That’s it, he said.	48.042429691166866
We are the fat.	81.701194533692
You and I are the fat in the fire.	109.79169091293696
We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	199.05791866853932
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
	1005.9497775117529
—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	406.58054229083825
We
mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	279.4111600095516
We think of Rome,
imperial, imperious, imperative.	762.4394530428801
—What was their civilisation?	162.28510323374576
Vast, I allow: but vile.	579.9629398806701
Cloacae: sewers.	464.672675952932
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to
be here.	177.66527592782532
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	362.98730036209673
The Roman, like the
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
obsession.	292.9256923683479
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to
be here.	165.28706752562042
Let us construct a watercloset._
	262.06545124147914
—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	256.7019651085063
Our old ancient
ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial
to the running stream.	260.39447547725393
—They were nature’s gentlemen, J.	287.7041715079166
O’Molloy murmured.	492.86248104692726
But we have
also Roman law.	303.9326455794743
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	833.9758113917715
—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	355.245580582388
O’Molloy asked.	255.87999104604643
It was at the royal university dinner.	176.6812884182604
Everything was going swimmingly
...	221.64899275371417
—First my riddle, Lenehan said.	284.60789263329633
Are you ready?	121.99682330697254
Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
the hallway.	459.7821163954243
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	299.5515165907602
—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.	681.5655582688006
—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously.	1079.3361660558037
Youth led by
Experience visits Notoriety.	667.0390046459928
the editor said, holding out a hand.	153.5146287216474
Come in.	24.26587054336645
Your
governor is just gone.	261.0170518816773
Lenehan said to all:
	50.8324677325066
—Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	723.9176214294037
Reflect, ponder,
excogitate, reply.	1467.6711418266545
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
signature.	289.5714265515835
the editor asked.	168.2920225209112
Bit torn off.	217.96163114667797
—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	521.8984454213411
—That old pelters, the editor said.	193.48535250286852
Who tore it?	150.1562644768099
On swift sail flaming
	792.8834005873628
From storm and south
	196.4557669674819
He comes, pale vampire,
	519.6222281415102
Mouth to my mouth.	80.52326414066997
—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
shoulders.	252.97778010099088
Foot and mouth?	61.037356369256365
Are you turned...?	81.95090308113771
Bullockbefriending bard.	209.1917535402865
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
	770.5244035147354
—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	467.8923605174389
The letter is not mine.	167.71338469651266
—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	314.8115754075716
The
bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	747.5762586941631
By Jesus, she had the foot and
mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the
waiter’s face in the Star and Garter.	206.53593967999504
A woman brought sin into the world.	186.2747589733195
For Helen, the runaway wife of
Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	308.49880517566316
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	343.8663345173876
—Is he a widower?	84.43591068370539
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
typescript.	298.1645260070085
Emperor’s horses.	111.48796670847005
An Irishman saved his life on
the ramparts of Vienna.	259.0342055911229
Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell,
graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	912.2153693110563
Sent his heir over to make the king an
Austrian fieldmarshal now.	255.2792571513211
Going to be trouble there one day.	127.98000874331018
Wild
geese.	216.96798358522335
Don’t you forget that!
	101.71034170961936
—The moot point is did he forget it, J.	323.25051764941526
O’Molloy said quietly,
turning a horseshoe paperweight.	530.2712556999313
Saving princes is a thank you job.	204.1683026181421
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	171.12207287880355
—And if not?	70.87835544122612
—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	266.4697741519481
A Hungarian it was one
day...	144.3384682100899
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
	1005.9497775117529
—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	226.2737889501816
Success for
us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	90.62326077937404
We were never
loyal to the successful.	183.2620321417883
We serve them.	210.705233669039
I teach the blatant Latin
language.	469.14866680284496
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
the maxim: time is money.	201.5902391041801
Material domination.	365.4355909322164
_Dominus!_ Lord! Where
is the spirituality?	265.15119950897844
Lord Jesus?	203.15938669399281
Lord Salisbury?	203.15938669399281
A sofa in a westend
club.	302.5112866006013
But the Greek!
	92.86513674241486
KYRIE ELEISON!
	203.15938669399281
A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
lips.	386.4631133135142
—The Greek! he said again.	143.50094878590073
_Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the
Semite and the Saxon know not.	292.88973265819396
_Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.	230.32076256960534
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	188.770813093772
_Kyrie eleison!_
The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	382.56462933682616
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered
at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	273.22652556035314
Yes, yes.	60.45787357664621
They went
under.	127.06397475685839
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve
the fortunes of Greece.	391.1703392174222
Loyal to a lost cause.	113.61887949071419
He strode away from them towards the window.	194.5412858926174
—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	295.94866924958785
Owing to a brick received in
the latter half of the _matinée_.	157.60861560951722
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
	288.026803842138
He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:
	332.9441142097531
LENEHAN’S LIMERICK
	494.0867752080217
—_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh
Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	749.5691251460945
I can’t see the Joe Miller.	218.94100715539477
Can you?_
	40.72983906996471
In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	385.5886177588832
Whose mother is beastly dead.	249.7192355119833
—That’ll be all right, he said.	98.69746728824823
I’ll read the rest after.	141.54314414052013
That’ll be
all right.	115.68730425038092
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	239.52719317051108
—But my riddle! he said.	120.62784974857982
What opera is like a railwayline?	208.81349649091064
Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.	849.8930527585402
Lenehan announced gladly:
	605.2995098946091
—_The Rose of Castile_.	244.1449739478468
See the wheeze?	101.3671280899581
Rows of cast steel.	194.64524337800367
He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	841.6055304218165
Mr O’Madden Burke fell
back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	482.00245021191887
—Help! he sighed.	113.3056167502648
I feel a strong weakness.	263.6023159321282
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
tissues.	378.7536337382764
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.	417.7418052540206
—Paris, past and present, he said.	103.83920779848097
You look like communards.	272.8733576582216
—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	317.8622325636205
O’Molloy said in
quiet mockery.	293.64094426130134
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland
between you?	161.97396471076226
You look as though you had done the deed.	165.3525618096515
General
Bobrikoff.	203.15938669399281
OMNIUM GATHERUM
	203.15938669399281
—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	211.69506686379822
—All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	363.6564200615578
Law, the classics...	115.09779344080313
—The turf, Lenehan put in.	288.44978370613956
—Literature, the press.	71.9881726919382
—If Bloom were here, the professor said.	161.95616584194462
The gentle art of
advertisement.	269.4256849384101
—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added.	1346.441061841896
The vocal muse.	740.1550303866238
Dublin’s
prime favourite.	273.17355904578847
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	255.99756941815187
—Ahem! he said very softly.	123.08616809817075
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
cold in the park.	187.89187484340823
The gate was open.	173.65586347246858
“YOU CAN DO IT!”
	770.5244035147354
The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.	308.8233994129077
—I want you to write something for me, he said.	110.5601032821455
Something with a bite
in it.	73.55939294778032
You can do it.	88.57315699932207
I see it in your face.	91.02702701619548
_In the lexicon of
youth_...	215.12218570042754
See it in your face.	75.95839912924649
See it in your eye.	83.27553741082275
Lazy idle little schemer.	506.25516926726004
—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	291.8946548618116
Great
nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory.	462.6237104773551
All balls! Bulldosing the
public! Give them something with a bite in it.	244.39235292434046
Put us all into it, damn
its soul.	195.65280693486204
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.	593.2982726873446
—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	856.7049571710905
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	255.86537415871382
—He wants you for the pressgang, J.	228.5046250926843
O’Molloy said.	165.5081573229974
THE GREAT GALLAHER
	494.0867752080217
—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
emphasis.	416.0258986411421
Wait a minute.	90.85272881772747
We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
Clarence.	323.9912756460667
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	91.02315891470161
That was a pen.	89.64049185448899
I’ll tell you.	111.13381953350928
That was the smartest piece
of journalism ever known.	288.33156155374
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
suppose.	283.0684175878268
I’ll show you.	129.74653742964423
He pushed past them to the files.	188.79219397398646
—Look at here, he said turning.	110.87857671608835
The _New York World_ cabled for a
special.	583.1181052541953
Remember that time?	59.868547667979875
Professor MacHugh nodded.	445.68207858654915
—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
hat.	420.1009184320551
Where it took place.	122.51324688517188
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	569.8468007712031
Joe Brady and
the rest of them.	95.08540199906757
Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car.	250.41932604542794
Whole route, see?	241.43553454773536
He has that
cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	258.61905622839373
Holohan told me.	95.81554646212625
You know Holohan?	224.9354653021633
—Hop and carry one, is it?	96.66981628730154
Myles Crawford said.	165.5081573229974
—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
the corporation.	234.7129661292652
Stephen turned in surprise.	155.7385239186591
You don’t say so?	133.2808894580785
A friend of my father’s, is it?	92.20316683485885
—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	931.9505206000907
Let Gumley mind the
stones, see they don’t run away.	260.1117911596285
Look at here.	75.98382578491346
What did Ignatius
Gallaher do?	363.2701848860194
I’ll tell you.	111.13381953350928
Inspiration of genius.	95.51023417474362
Cabled right away.	125.63524428631918
Have you got that?	71.59804394188315
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	184.7014802130213
—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say.	385.85195180075596
Have
you got that?	71.59804394188315
The telephone whirred.	601.951581388831
A DISTANT VOICE
	494.0867752080217
—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.	140.6887898204631
—B is parkgate.	199.18410411527546
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	550.9559156370385
—T is viceregal lodge.	301.9268275094397
C is where murder took place.	229.92642269078422
K is Knockmaroon
gate.	278.3062262176655
An illstarched
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
waistcoat.	355.7673988126538
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	230.09153911143108
Who’s there?...	50.66833327933683
—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	564.1374868915287
F.A.B.P.	770.5244035147354
Got that?	29.63054047888148
X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	333.94237774113617
The professor came to the inner door.	152.78463673563493
—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	84.21164529183353
—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	163.8031335667244
X is Davy’s
publichouse, see?	240.66045642923604
CLEVER, VERY
	203.15938669399281
—Clever, Lenehan said.	165.5081573229974
—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
history.	232.26060450258112
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	182.54705484748226
—I saw it, the editor said proudly.	169.44905807368096
I was present.	103.00782350048013
Dick Adams, the
besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
myself.	235.26193081673966
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
	230.2162895014221
—Madam, I’m Adam.	434.713294641431
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	772.8495538692761
—History! Myles Crawford cried.	544.0370749890304
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was
there first.	240.00119047313783
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	182.92440039597858
Out of
an advertisement.	107.0486952139872
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	163.4502035291849
That gave him the
leg up.	114.08452983105637
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld.	300.474087669231
That’s press.	109.74476348381313
That’s talent.	198.8601454919128
Pyatt! He
was all their daddies!
	241.51679316666397
—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.	355.37454750011756
Are you there?...	54.347634876770215
Yes, he’s here still.	85.43496295658052
Come across
yourself.	244.04665402153717
—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	185.25186098993078
the editor cried.	196.89941320351704
He flung the pages down.	176.52750266243117
—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.	841.74971109928
—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	796.3008628926931
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	232.41358872602845
—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
were up before the recorder...	172.74169715053145
—O yes, J.	220.43266412802666
O’Molloy said eagerly.	319.5414756859314
And it turned
out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
Skin-the-Goat.	330.2547382530603
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
	346.61478547334883
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.	341.79540128191826
Ah, bloody nonsense.	348.6577020970767
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	565.3498275999917
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	228.98462785192652
How do you know?	83.96293057584931
Why did you
write it then?	118.37996950924433
RHYMES AND REASONS
	494.0867752080217
Mouth, south.	131.70859696140226
Or the south a mouth?	85.85349351014456
Must be
some.	81.54204429483444
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	725.8759846751263
Rhymes: two men dressed the
same, looking the same, two by two.	158.25037455184912
la tua pace
	535.2393381618116
che parlar ti piace
	1378.273236337404
Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.	1537.8541758918718
He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
russet, entwining, _per l’aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più ardenti._
But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
south: tomb womb.	903.3220830511376
—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	482.6066719208577
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	770.5244035147354
O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	500.34524333412065
—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
construction on my words.	317.0636382960635
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running
away with you.	411.4705106331539
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes
and Edmund Burke?	360.26055283514336
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod
boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the
Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s
Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	458.6101335694818
Why bring
in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	295.18638712042093
Sufficient for the
day is the newspaper thereof.	128.39030781917234
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
	1201.6266902949878
—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
face.	182.0664921157113
Irish volunteers.	249.72410360095353
Where are you now?	81.72629152953196
Established 1763.	203.15938669399281
Dr Lucas.	203.15938669399281
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	333.31073633643507
—Well, J.	203.15938669399281
O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.	565.7241601798031
the editor said.	108.77100003908359
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	229.45573947060768
He has a strain of it
in his blood.	104.7832553368353
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	719.818222828833
—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
....	150.80848484059575
But no matter.	121.4614334050386
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
	217.017683798845
—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	305.353545039005
It was in that case of fratricide,
the Childs murder case.	200.42137131497026
Bushe defended him.	232.68652232674543
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._
	178.38566457367372
By the way how did he find that out?	103.70730063397336
He died in his sleep.	128.15330465250935
Or the other
story, beast with two backs?	232.03127670444783
—What was that?	40.27220657095264
the professor asked.	145.12139648536265
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
	494.0867752080217
—He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	197.1922049961028
O’Molloy said, of Roman justice
as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	499.3001188163291
And he
cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	190.6895413462894
—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	1064.393069210938
O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	298.71735994778754
False lull.	464.672675952932
Something quite ordinary.	319.8648712173149
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	303.5412619247088
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	269.97234136587286
A POLISHED PERIOD
	494.0867752080217
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
	617.670337207453
His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	365.13048734356806
—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	295.1659637996346
—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	1136.342658059945
—You like it?	52.81975721683447
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	341.2089097140693
He
took a cigarette from the case.	124.22974341092412
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
trophy, saying:
	305.45513660137266
—Muchibus thankibus.	464.672675952932
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
	1005.9497775117529
—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	219.44494930607794
O’Molloy said
to Stephen.	223.36423679924144
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
hush poets: A.	413.00309699574586
the mastermystic?	299.35884665341155
That Blavatsky woman started it.	297.7852554455916
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	177.75487535469765
has been telling some yankee
interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
ask him about planes of consciousness.	213.85212346605164
Magennis thinks you must have
been pulling A.	333.89984238722866
He is a man of the very highest morale,
Magennis.	193.28960257449734
Speaking about me.	71.16761811520313
What did he say?	83.3539245249433
What did he say?	83.3539245249433
What did he say
about me?	103.49779455828708
Don’t ask.	128.26876570802963
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	488.55732250025636
Let me say one thing.	127.48549233149157
The finest display of oratory I
ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
society.	517.1241420709651
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	340.8692772645607
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
	274.571043803033
—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	427.0487228047702
Then you can imagine the style of his
discourse.	168.2810668100935
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	415.4183332899528
O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on
the Trinity college estates commission.	455.066491596903
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s
frock.	221.28843790200284
Go on.	32.610077424956444
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely
upon the new movement.	314.02842466607365
It was then a new movement.	132.20732278193282
We were weak,
therefore worthless.	608.3241948624144
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
focus.	360.1335932165224
In ferial tone he addressed J.	672.0493618240131
O’Molloy:
	203.15938669399281
—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	159.16189502274483
That he had
prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
shorthandwriter in the hall.	212.2865177484225
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
beard round it.	296.44174662240334
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
looked (though he was not) a dying man.	239.90545419893473
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	300.14096910410063
O’Molloy’s towards
Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	226.84722876731098
His
unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
withering hair.	593.9785222404898
Still seeking, he said:
	125.25319784786404
—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	613.2889859002179
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	223.25974997607977
He raised his head firmly.	256.0262212488799
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	411.2163199352981
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	525.5044665038358
He began:
	119.75076087671418
_—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
since by my learned friend.	308.8925868115168
It seemed to me that I had been transported
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this
age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful
Moses._
	282.2014731612717
_And let our
crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.	432.96402803733287
Look out.	43.961956629777546
Could you try your hand
at it yourself?	161.95358402533742
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	241.15542456505594
I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me._
	151.2648956595212
FROM THE FATHERS
	494.0867752080217
It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they
were good could be corrupted.	320.814745883981
Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.	368.15378819754517
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
language?	410.9904990758504
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	297.5631734235298
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
furrow the waters of the known globe.	494.00493870066276
You have but emerged from
primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
history and a polity._
	353.1877212806256
Child, man, effigy.	279.02996955989596
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.	430.9586724323023
Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	535.1254735602076
Israel is
weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
arms.	238.94601805056428
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
our name._
	198.94883058405446
A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	616.9855861864958
He lifted his voice above it
boldly:
	256.7779665050611
_—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never
have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor
followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	250.01458483019292
He would never have spoken
with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have
come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of
the outlaw._
	222.95839694930552
He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	234.48676745425774
O’Molloy said not without regret:
	309.64877490995707
—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	234.69031650090704
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—
expectorated—demise, Lenehan added.	715.4208500306148
And with a great future behind him.	139.38716682236662
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and
pattering up the staircase.	317.8153207268675
—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	256.4995588281673
Gone with the wind.	58.95687727100958
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	168.4064170222543
Miles
of ears of porches.	149.81892013081634
The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the
four winds.	314.170736513166
A people sheltered within his voice.	333.31458210461216
Dead noise.	161.75487270836388
Akasic
records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	263.7129468466865
Love and laud him: me
no more.	149.13224729160214
I have money.	110.74906385661873
—Gentlemen, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
suggest that the house do now adjourn?	306.6093842243937
—You take my breath away.	203.87749997793
It is not perchance a French compliment?	341.19682073270405
Mr
O’Madden Burke asked.	677.8227751383337
’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	541.1079015811114
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	289.7902619021136
All that are in favour
say ay, Lenehan announced.	327.9083311178655
The contrary no.	217.04629150815174
I declare it carried.	261.8079689878689
To
which particular boosing shed...?	589.6000612516079
My casting vote is: Mooney’s!
	473.05255809336325
He led the way, admonishing:
	232.5524514049478
—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	347.9166277529018
Yes,
we will not.	100.86393592023468
By no manner of means.	163.53543575446432
Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his
umbrella:
	440.131072580375
—Lay on, Macduff!
	146.0554807867269
—Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
shoulder.	193.94339691580683
Where are those blasted keys?	349.9910512205005
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	332.5540796256057
—Foot and mouth.	61.037356369256365
I know.	62.35918204518505
That’ll be all right.	115.68730425038092
That’ll go in.	92.38766221158818
Where are
they?	69.07460521413789
That’s all right.	71.46889546300201
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	201.24044094157202
LET US HOPE
	494.0867752080217
—I hope you will live to see it published.	196.67520593162456
Myles, one moment.	112.66359738349598
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	202.2382526976217
—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	174.1661576929704
That is fine, isn’t it?	161.20195525904157
It
has the prophetic vision.	258.75556979148087
_Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.	548.9843079483054
Kingdoms of this world.	77.25938757498756
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen
today.	311.3252504061705
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
rushed out into the street, yelling:
	308.61174145576484
—Racing special!
	154.44741041239482
I have much, much to learn.	168.11089052573615
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	179.1375902615432
—I have a vision too, Stephen said.	201.15213693953243
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	249.0898913700735
Crawford will
follow.	183.23461999402844
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
	410.8666541303721
—Racing special!
	154.44741041239482
DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
	494.0867752080217
—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.	546.1649976949631
—Where is that?	43.8437134325822
the professor asked.	145.12139648536265
—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	339.27239792854846
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	496.05864736010477
Against the wall.	57.60837171328882
Face glistering
tallow under her fustian shawl.	942.0835021998301
Frantic hearts.	186.17224428268239
Akasic records.	365.4416887200119
Quicker, darlint!
	464.672675952932
On now.	56.330396450281164
Dare it.	30.60773084408939
Let there be life.	103.0328267904061
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.	172.0928789584302
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	381.1865035152611
They
shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
with the blade of a knife.	231.00905559352975
Two and three in silver and one and seven in
coppers.	133.93478814596654
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	239.71078006428115
—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	378.49725636633605
LIFE ON THE RAW
	770.5244035147354
—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress...	483.33997359305346
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from
a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the
brawn.	229.25124198223182
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile
and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the
other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,
threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	332.7414621967194
Glory be to God.	123.82655783101062
They had no idea it was that high.	119.724758753788
Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who
got a bottleful from a passionist father.	284.8052509912083
Florence MacCabe takes a
crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	363.9874478142037
—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	179.54996443693778
Vestal virgins.	181.76739389403767
I can
see them.	112.48281467562944
What’s keeping our friend?	214.442005639364
He turned.	85.09382951480983
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	593.7150223491016
Hard after them
Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
face, talking with J.	356.67792306382535
O’Molloy.	203.15938669399281
—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	230.97276430118768
He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.	223.71310390316305
RETURN OF BLOOM
	494.0867752080217
—Yes, he said.	39.595082423913524
I see them.	80.83689763379053
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:
	456.7623846236829
—Mr Crawford! A moment!
	535.2386178855661
—_Telegraph_! Racing special!
	411.55927002276485
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	263.4530016267196
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:
	378.8062971847804
—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
	406.2058726515033
INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
	770.5244035147354
—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	335.01866746019925
I spoke with Mr Keyes
just now.	355.1738462075972
He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	192.76816769702907
After he’ll
see.	83.81581508469905
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the
Saturday pink.	208.1629599068583
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told
councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	322.02143025612395
I can have access to it
in the national library.	144.45604550186363
House of keys, don’t you see?	123.33307913167579
His name is
Keyes.	195.6631788582763
It’s a play on the name.	74.20989363496405
But he practically promised he’d give
the renewal.	241.24576708323866
But he wants just a little puff.	172.73635421673433
What will I tell him, Mr
Crawford?	448.7199230710905
K.M.A.	494.0867752080217
—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	182.19461152418862
Myles Crawford said throwing
out his arm for emphasis.	308.98448974776085
Tell him that straight from the stable.	133.5951810506257
A bit nervy.	397.68586890943385
Look out for squalls.	176.69225220190762
All off for a drink.	93.42500076953942
Arm in arm.	82.01558577841318
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	314.3815084000153
Usual blarney.	365.4416887200119
Wonder is
that young Dedalus the moving spirit.	216.02399689930982
Has a good pair of boots on him
today.	137.57379444689997
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	205.95137108961143
Been walking in
muck somewhere.	307.661430025103
Careless chap.	113.07104031998887
What was he doing in Irishtown?	131.64728084708818
—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
suppose it’s worth a short par.	361.7061708114936
He’d give the ad, I think.	269.9110382402198
I’ll tell
him...	117.43994347935016
K.M.R.I.A.	1005.9497775117529
—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
shoulder.	587.3378076918497
Any time he likes, tell him.	146.66435474427146
While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
jerkily.	323.25672732115015
RAISING THE WIND
	494.0867752080217
—_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	244.76123874354133
I’m up to
here.	93.86812953805114
I’ve been through the hoop myself.	303.5555586049746
I was looking for a fellow to
back a bill for me no later than last week.	182.07905853964525
Sorry, Jack.	203.15938669399281
You must take
the will for the deed.	119.84754349593221
With a heart and a half if I could raise the
wind anyhow.	202.17581472227909
O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	249.39795211759593
They caught
up on the others and walked abreast.	191.04802074555832
—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
railings.	182.4469570636533
—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	212.19626992078838
Two old
Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.	217.07778108248021
SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
	1500.5868986082914
—That’s new, Myles Crawford said.	268.27648527159835
That’s copy.	114.82612609714492
Out for the waxies’
Dargle.	208.9705330210948
Two old trickies, what?	226.467685559083
—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	260.55561179956237
They see
the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’
blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.	481.55313871723337
But it makes them
giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...	249.7602188971119
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
	770.5244035147354
—Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	267.8793058090283
No poetic licence.	692.6498235923291
We’re in the
archdiocese here.	149.76996533531866
—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
of the onehandled adulterer.	323.15069834531573
—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	238.82932184527752
I like that.	51.054530641345096
I see the
idea.	83.99076020087861
I see what you mean.	115.64408803798847
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
	1615.9391829393662
—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
tired to look up or down or to speak.	206.55678054992583
They put the bag of plums between
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	240.85686132537592
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	259.68608919536956
Lenehan and Mr O’Madden
Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.	536.330456434925
Myles Crawford said.	165.5081573229974
So long as they do no worse.	162.6450913396527
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS.	1364.292885274888

ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.	1005.9497775117529
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
Gorgias, the sophist.	231.51565543245735
It is said of him that none could tell if he were
bitterer against others or against himself.	204.42400866378804
He was the son of a noble
and a bondwoman.	101.05442690829949
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	201.7546303393266
Poor Penelope.	203.15938669399281
Penelope Rich.	203.15938669399281
They made ready to cross O’Connell street.	430.6176383848393
HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
	494.0867752080217
At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper
Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit.	739.3354312369434
Hackney cars, cabs,
delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water
floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,
rapidly.	1734.6374540832137
WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?	770.5244035147354
—But what do you call it?	97.78875343679155
Myles Crawford asked.	255.87999104604643
Where did they get the
plums?	134.48872264187963
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	494.0867752080217
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	1201.6266902949878
—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
reflect.	220.5494228103313
Call it, let me see.	100.0614798418075
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._
	888.5237716701477
—No, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of The Plums._
	485.48975997273055
—I see, the professor said.	82.17802198612311
He laughed richly.	419.77293404288724
—I see, he said again with new pleasure.	143.84781530324034
Moses and the promised land.	104.35293772787008
We gave him that idea, he added to J.	182.55424113629917
O’Molloy.	203.15938669399281
HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
	1364.292885274888
O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
his peace.	375.2192484090525
—I see, the professor said.	82.17802198612311
He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
through the meshes of his wry smile.	459.47034554484014

—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly.	371.61197795569785
That tickles me, I must
say.	404.0435228667492
—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s
truth was known.	301.6598539512037

Paying game.	167.46119621294278
Torry and Alexander last year.	210.56470210758806
His wife will put
the stopper on that.	157.89590021461515
Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the
luminous crucifix.	378.5415393280589
Our Saviour.	203.15938669399281
Wake up in the dead of night and see
him on the wall, hanging.	96.22705640688842
Pepper’s ghost idea.	183.1860138165909
Iron Nails Ran In.	770.5244035147354
Phosphorus it must be done with.	110.3051004782799
If you leave a bit of codfish for
instance.	176.33583276050072
I could see the bluey silver over it.	181.23368917304592
Night I went down to
the pantry in the kitchen.	153.8941241204537
Don’t like all the smells in it waiting to
rush out.	143.74108180745222
What was it she wanted?	89.95516867411493
The Malaga raisins.	857.7157624187907
Thinking of
Spain.	106.7296495237354
The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny.	785.7084302363465
Very good for the brain.	103.53320026931412
From Butler’s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor’s walk.	414.8150309224146
Dedalus’ daughter there still outside Dillon’s auctionrooms.	419.3971475324755
Must be
selling off some old furniture.	314.87062302294987
Knew her eyes at once from the father.	99.0888384918572
Lobbing about waiting for him.	111.59988660759187
Home always breaks up when the mother
goes.	225.6273181212029
Fifteen children he had.	93.57927619349158
Birth every year almost.	287.7714156060843
That’s in their
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the
absolution.	181.79287457712513
Increase and multiply.	137.3510822204639
Eat
you out of house and home.	84.81882648979264
No families themselves to feed.	327.62826080505204
Living on
the fat of the land.	64.61013831074372
Their butteries and larders.	458.2103975051345
I’d like to see them
do the black fast Yom Kippur.	241.3859134455542
One meal and a collation for
fear he’d collapse on the altar.	225.33721309402023
A housekeeper of one of those fellows
if you could pick it out of her.	159.39191034047252
Never pick it out of her.	90.0327689940737
Like getting
£.	111.15890647477678
out of him.	33.0660893084866
Does himself well.	116.7958461702958
No guests.	287.39671252413314
All for number one.	110.26988249497684
Watching his water.	75.13818417167954
Bring your own bread and butter.	187.4090429302283
His reverence:
mum’s the word.	268.42790773959354
Good Lord, that poor child’s dress is in flitters.	260.9156993362816
Underfed she looks
too.	141.94135100419953
Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes.	338.7810774985334
It’s after they feel it.	99.26971654680752
Proof of the pudding.	74.5386890434507
Undermines the constitution.	110.39317690892123
As he set foot on O’Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
the parapet.	333.11477706539785
Brewery barge with export stout.	630.0371402371151
Sea air sours
it, I heard.	442.8880831843712
Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see
the brewery.	242.48280855826616
Regular world in itself.	125.58208935363932
Vats of porter wonderful.	176.81186133127736
Rats
get in too.	80.93511696455249
Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating.	403.98740382259865
Dead
drunk on the porter.	134.28744025825955
Drink till they puke again like christians.	373.6993867332949
Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats.	528.4164598073062
Well, of course, if we knew all the
things.	112.38663741917401
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
quaywalls, gulls.	613.1590177927036
Rough weather outside.	329.6447309801416
If I threw myself down?	410.9605001574193
Reuben
J’s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.	286.6851132843239
One and
eightpence too much.	154.05948483734008
It’s the droll way he comes out with the
things.	119.33831801859296
Knows how to tell a story too.	130.12572552803357
They wheeled lower.	451.02862080253846
Looking for grub.	185.9853245753302
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	335.29151202294975
Elijah thirtytwo feet
per sec is com.	728.7572362441896
Not a bit.	54.65453709645426
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of
swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	382.64846981812303
Not such damn fools.	424.4236656752846
Also the
day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the
wake fifty yards astern.	328.23204750249613
Live by their wits.	166.24736250459202
They wheeled, flapping.	613.2514814394029
The hungry famished gull
	965.7403624280809
Flaps o’er the waters dull.	218.47508562451227
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	306.2551353810541
But then Shakespeare has
no rhymes: blank verse.	558.3213565194043
The flow of the language it is.	96.82945316911851
The thoughts.	159.16256273155892
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit
	331.705540627545
Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.	109.50302571595479
—Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
	249.08527646066466
His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.	395.4486328486512
Australians they must be this time of year.	131.09866827143367
Shiny peels: polishes them
up with a rag or a handkerchief.	280.64329732063834
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes
for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down
into the Liffey.	312.9006164509802
See that?	29.63054047888148
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all
from their heights, pouncing on prey.	553.6808329925129
Every morsel.	317.5334699131929
Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his
hands.	249.1871963728974
Live on fish, fishy flesh they
have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose.	580.5748450573105
Wonder
what kind is swanmeat.	230.98287529286102
Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.	158.13381705174598
They wheeled flapping weakly.	989.2416553656192
I’m not going to throw any more.	173.64325500204683
Penny
quite enough.	198.37827203114907
Lot of thanks I get.	212.55523115430987
Not even a caw.	201.43661065448444
They spread foot and
mouth disease too.	281.0226092976746
If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes
like that.	285.218088239979
Eat pig like pig.	316.8722783514042
But then why is it that saltwater fish are
not salty?	257.7256037880336
How is that?	43.8437134325822
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	444.23920130809967
Kino’s
	29.459917166355844
Good idea that.	93.37048230558194
Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation.	179.78412574245178
How can you
own water really?	208.79962490278135
It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same,
which in the stream of life we trace.	167.4436188471701
Because life is a stream.	134.19926066826562
All
kinds of places are good for ads.	249.33791295115697
That quack doctor for the clap used
to be stuck up in all the greenhouses.	219.6433362468787
Never see it now.	82.73919364352027
Dr Hy Franks.	494.0867752080217
Didn’t cost him a red like Maginni the
dancing master self advertisement.	336.79564973908657
running in to loosen
a button.	146.07703735054696
Just the place too.	71.92159444995991
POST NO BILLS.	494.0867752080217
If he...?	25.706179759234487
No, no.	48.149160651800685
I don’t believe it.	129.16030492928095
He wouldn’t surely?	264.96457253002706
No, no.	48.149160651800685
Think no more about
that.	93.3124768569321
After one.	47.004415340154765
Timeball on the ballastoffice is down.	111.80740902724828
Dunsink time.	59.26338156361836
Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball’s.	198.43989799337567
I never
exactly understood.	380.2737744473372
There’s a priest.	72.79854565087464
Could ask him.	108.08273412406359
Par it’s Greek:
parallel, parallax.	349.3014489973495
Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her
about the transmigration.	279.9576400489389
O rocks!
	150.21429608575608
Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	372.22099488232783
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the
sound.	198.9520938555688
She’s not exactly witty.	233.00058353816348
Can be rude too.	198.15688544228507
Blurt out what I was
thinking.	193.26810656460887
Still, I don’t know.	221.84805583938484
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base
barreltone voice.	354.56958835782876
He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was
singing into a barrel.	221.80989702839273
Now, isn’t that wit.	220.34729024198884
They used to call him big
Ben.	229.8887904531458
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	410.58019229679235
Appetite like an
albatross.	221.18740476574266
Get outside of a baron of beef.	174.6397839572702
Powerful man he was at
stowing away number one Bass.	244.3825051292931
Barrel of Bass.	106.7296495237354
It all works out.	119.38005871290427
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him
along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	700.3911598820793
Like
that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	246.00502038014005
He
read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	366.5408747232931
Wisdom Hely’s.	136.37444050802486
Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	293.7936745913915
Our
staple food.	591.6131238128428
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
street.	237.14178573428467
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	377.0306514249666
They are
not Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men.	326.6188989647337
I
suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	589.7676137674703
I
bet that would have caught on.	190.3199120389225
Smart girls writing something catch the
eye at once.	261.49168906018224
Everyone dying to know what she’s writing.	147.18172708747923
Get twenty of
them round you if you stare at nothing.	180.2149424024147
Have a finger in the pie.	104.5946099545272
Women
too.	56.16717052284047
Pillar of salt.	87.7064719372695
Wouldn’t have it of course because he
didn’t think of it himself first.	126.80482216403107
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
false stain of black celluloid.	388.05322487859945
His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s
potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	511.3334004994966
You can’t lick ’em.	352.33387434177956
Our envelopes.	216.98246382346196
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	195.6865940934655
Can’t stop,
Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser
_Kansell,_ sold by Hely’s Ltd, 85 Dame street.	661.9739048398365
Well out of that ruck I
am.	210.1780073423183
Tranquilla convent.	236.72887101340675
That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	230.25558745682616
Wimple suited her small head.	315.6424979934336
I am sure she was crossed
in love by her eyes.	160.7160376419191
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	130.54261215586158
I
disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	252.30105724696483
But glad to communicate
with the outside world.	211.73864390558276
Our great day, she said.	123.97966124165728
Sweet name too: caramel.	292.45323815592064
If she had married she would have changed.	183.55245905148166
I suppose they
really were short of money.	206.13188205414153
Fried everything in the best butter all the
same.	116.23053358838423
No lard for them.	189.73905449405612
My heart’s broke eating dripping.	422.40878960998026
They like
buttering themselves in and out.	165.8403212610997
Molly tasting it, her veil up.	236.30622835762475
Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker’s daughter.	242.1433677258894
It was a nun they say invented
barbed wire.	357.4371965790199
He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by.	613.1348144301209
Rover
cycleshop.	464.672675952932
Those races are on today.	213.51937002300556
How long ago is that?	117.05149980348499
Year Phil
Gilligan died.	612.2737435913122
We were in Lombard street west.	227.63075232459175
Wait: was in Thom’s.	95.30153948967308
Got
the job in Wisdom Hely’s year we married.	246.84672848225807
Six years.	85.53419316783665
Val
Dillon was lord mayor.	282.88278258122443
The Glencree dinner.	411.55927002276485
Alderman Robert O’Reilly
emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell.	486.6747889085605
Bobbob lapping it
for the inner alderman.	241.13734243049
Couldn’t hear what the band played.	184.45839448687593
For what we
have already received may the Lord make us.	272.98027493232206
Milly was a kiddy then.	133.4861946025973
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs.	297.25734713313864
Mantailored
with selfcovered buttons.	361.15628082697515
She didn’t like it because I sprained my
ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	423.42151522379925
As if that.	55.0082373161762
Old
Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	367.9771487529127
Flies’ picnic too.	218.96199656374282
Never put a dress on her back like it.	114.13016575791451
Fitted her like a glove,
shoulders and hips.	206.2578039428422
Just beginning to plump it out well.	175.91342609796735
Rabbitpie we
had that day.	96.73185599648721
People looking after her.	111.83006125386896
Happier then.	51.270025270301566
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	154.2692136188964
Dockrell’s, one and ninepence a dozen.	136.04773480796277
Milly’s tubbing night.	227.93466065551058
American
soap I bought: elderflower.	929.3100215386713
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	178.06895333218617
Funny she
looked soaped all over.	223.4053900378933
Shapely too.	56.16717052284047
Now photography.	365.4416887200119
Poor papa’s
daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	252.25029916153912
Hereditary taste.	167.47795998869006
He walked along the curbstone.	171.3679564774125
Stream of life.	52.44132298153246
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was
always squinting in when he passed?	163.835102136731
Weak eyes, woman.	112.53041678864516
Stopped in
Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade.	281.20223574102357
Pen something.	77.1097993735296
My memory is
getting.	195.05801588984718
Of course it’s years ago.	147.40620261713232
Noise of the trams
probably.	124.09662987542725
Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he
sees every day.	191.1455564912499
Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	225.2936939957975
Seeing her home
after practice.	212.4094410044748
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	251.61339926401322
Gave her
that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	231.51924149929022
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting
on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the
supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	289.4247313314332
He and I behind.	159.33130499397254
Sheet of
her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	221.6418665300162
Lucky
it didn’t.	101.53198194410113
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	113.32591965799335
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	350.5269287727318
Shaky on his pins, poor old
sot.	258.3596741740468
His farewell concerts.	656.393663217798
Positively last appearance on any stage.	296.6878678494866
May be for months and may be for never.	135.6962011312132
Remember her laughing at the
wind, her blizzard collar up.	211.5270000268137
Corner of Harcourt road remember that
gust.	321.6467198879068
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old
Goodwin.	406.45417014382645
She did get flushed in the wind.	144.60051217307233
Remember when we got home
raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her
supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	295.8675750157792
And the mulled rum.	280.4598926920365
Could see
her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays:
white.	195.213992685809
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	197.78270355454868
Always warm from her.	108.59881779539306
Always liked to let her self out.	188.31886718564417
Sitting there after till near two
taking out her hairpins.	266.8657863087404
Milly tucked up in beddyhouse.	286.7511824614202
That was the night...	49.09100178254924
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	273.6770166966031
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	273.7449505540898
—No use complaining.	500.7653327067167
How is Molly those times?	241.40017879983628
Haven’t seen her for
ages.	168.00421666775733
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	365.9380531841417
Milly has a position down in
Mullingar, you know.	167.61143760856874
—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?	188.91516274430012
In a photographer’s there.	132.18678502478505
Getting on like a house on fire.	106.22010501076952
How
are all your charges?	198.14417549338222
—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.	278.10604184833767
No other in sight.	117.2404041992529
—You’re in black, I see.	216.17897048076333
You have no...	71.94840608686489
—No, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	339.04232441807176
Who’s dead, when and what did he
die of?	102.47733047549548
Turn up like a bad penny.	141.15808971168457
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	328.3815699476879
I hope it wasn’t any near relation.	323.98827945001466
May as well get her sympathy.	190.62253515084336
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
An old friend of mine.	140.94800131573325
He died quite suddenly,
poor fellow.	369.4118653476676
Heart trouble, I believe.	449.24401719258896
Funeral was this morning.	100.93625453834038
Your funeral’s tomorrow
	200.72848804086766
While you’re coming through the rye.	171.79165753152563
Diddlediddle dumdum
	464.672675952932
—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.	403.2694525563256
Now that’s quite enough about that.	117.77039692039712
Just: quietly: husband.	269.8882830049
—And your lord and master?	123.89955144129578
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes.	250.2658912227464
Hasn’t lost them anyhow.	193.9968187920352
—O, don’t be talking! she said.	137.842470882622
He’s a caution to rattlesnakes.	177.00893248192153
He has me
heartscalded.	244.1265501927174
Wait till I show you.	261.26447701585755
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
out from Harrison’s.	648.4797655952159
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s
gullet.	511.8443566754944
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
or they’d taste it with the hot tea.	355.2322534558852
Or is it from her?	61.696197277396465
A barefoot arab
stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	386.3799879402845
Deaden the gnaw of
hunger that way.	171.90214857397862
Pleasure or pain is it?	116.21161873523815
Penny dinner.	154.44741041239482
Knife and fork
chained to the table.	151.21392734554826
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	571.110653125663
Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
those things.	166.2790459172697
Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram.	91.02925011188543
Please take one.	102.75277621685393
Devils if they lose sixpence.	290.94769140699935
Raise Cain.	203.15938669399281
Husband barging.	464.672675952932
Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday?	219.97405709934145
Are
you feeding your little brother’s family?	245.84406248418114
Pastille that was fell.	88.06117974511685
What is she?...	53.64544865458103
—There must be a new moon out, she said.	134.1342122534368
He’s always bad then.	134.80520027006878
Do you
know what he did last night?	119.4399918922047
Her hand ceased to rummage.	294.4203602702454
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
Let her speak.	103.6831493691318
Look straight in her eyes.	113.83313401418866
I believe you.	93.94205497269184
Trust me.	43.12221257392657
—Woke me up in the night, she said.	71.34304373210014
Dream he had, a nightmare.	98.76355597991584
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	165.0307433658959
—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	465.5347480688355
—Read that, she said.	56.632561403766054
He got it this morning.	130.73216038294078
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	253.38048412610027
p: up, she said.	69.85702593102654
Someone taking a rise out of him.	115.9211128964376
It’s a great
shame for them whoever he is.	142.9269340518838
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	208.1037019597511
She took back the card, sighing.	203.75650912890362
—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office.	199.6486930720491
He’s going to take an
action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	204.8245710639646
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	271.7913412192954
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	428.91315839288956
Seen
its best days.	195.41640520390365
Wispish hair over her ears.	176.72731142928367
And that dowdy toque: three
old grapes to take the harm out of it.	240.60762071764137
Shabby genteel.	464.672675952932
She used to be a
tasty dresser.	219.27575146193365
Lines round her mouth.	118.27221653028492
Only a year or so older than
Molly.	265.08886025967536
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	138.40929020743675
The unfair sex.	772.1515523918706
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	233.68917510171053
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	1555.2062745879894
I’m hungry too.	226.86820772379198
Flakes of
pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her
cheek.	291.97174008295036
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	1081.79914009048
Josie
Powell that was.	116.39089919205679
In Luke Doyle’s long ago.	350.9506538096991
Dolphin’s Barn, the
charades.	176.78131868051514
p: up.	44.5676377971097
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	252.65102987620952
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
—Mina Purefoy?	203.15938669399281
she said.	38.609677750789345
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	386.24920397833307
Playgoers’ Club.	203.15938669399281
Matcham often thinks of
the masterstroke.	183.936525017544
Did I pull the chain?	305.20209592109666
The last act.	187.07524937937401
—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.	107.3752108223374
She’s in the
lying-in hospital in Holles street.	140.71328287452104
Dr Horne got her in.	143.33146060176918
She’s three
days bad now.	181.93996318902364
—O, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
I’m sorry to hear that.	141.67088994219483
—Yes, Mrs Breen said.	339.27239792854846
And a houseful of kids at home.	218.98544295367935
It’s a very stiff
birth, the nurse told me.	184.82566148199294
—O, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	766.2853442576996
His tongue clacked in
compassion.	420.4303147722206
Dth! Dth!
	203.15938669399281
—I’m sorry to hear that, he said.	116.79933792560325
Poor thing! Three days! That’s
terrible for her.	304.4251731921449
Mrs Breen nodded.	445.68207858654915
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	164.4723430821638
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
	573.4053541219199
—Mind! Let this man pass.	285.50706497608456
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	352.94158197323503
From his arm a folded dustcoat,
a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.	258.6404271159002
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	263.0616791250063
He always walks outside the lampposts.	331.1638335853122
—Who is he if it’s a fair question?	103.52411039111232
Mrs Breen asked.	255.87999104604643
Is he dotty?	155.75834702341214
—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr
Bloom said smiling.	997.8227564871618
—He has enough of them, she said.	108.78959922941547
Denis will be like that one of these
days.	124.70615102806697
She broke off suddenly.	277.5378052524814
—There he is, she said.	59.13486659259201
I must go after him.	128.80041765325836
Remember me to
Molly, won’t you?	155.4000806578748
—I will, Mr Bloom said.	321.44131523544735
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	428.10628856270165
Denis
Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of
Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	525.3603212831679
Blown in from the bay.	69.0299571444106
Like old times.	127.51689211786183
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and
thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he
spoke earnestly.	391.47697202450865
Off his chump.	175.3799878283971
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.	381.7766923934555
Going the two
days.	79.96556635572873
Watch him! Out he goes again.	195.78890433870032
One way of getting on in the world.	80.28861757132846
And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds.	338.80184636189915
Hard time she must have
with him.	103.33115628452997
p: up.	44.5676377971097
I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.	429.8861618855857
Wrote
it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything.	236.03287278800514
Round to Menton’s
office.	154.84524429435632
His oyster eyes staring at the postcard.	272.5463222951028
Be a feast for the
gods.	122.5629114357397
He passed the _Irish Times_.	272.4316306824959
There might be other answers lying there.	299.2003192225487
Good system for criminals.	373.9068331977086
At their
lunch now.	189.75415253669894
Clerk with the glasses there doesn’t know me.	143.31918913714492
O, leave them
there to simmer.	216.40779819947588
Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them.	473.7129896223318
Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work.	418.8475662465582
I called
you naughty darling because I do not like that other world.	274.0429990930242
Please tell
me what is the meaning.	120.17315806691592
Please tell me what perfume does your wife.	226.1898649783898
Tell me who made the world.	98.4004183836283
The way they spring those questions on you.	210.2129182816281
And the other one Lizzie Twigg.	205.61444900753074
My literary efforts have had the good
fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A.	261.2325667084735
(Mr Geo.	203.15938669399281

Bought the _Irish
Field_ now.	220.88608028753987
Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement
and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement
yesterday at Rathoath.	456.1171800549098
Uneatable fox.	177.7498368753637
Pothunters too.	56.16717052284047
Fear injects
juices make it tender enough for them.	449.97990096215415
Riding astride.	317.5334699131929
Weightcarrying huntress.	464.672675952932
No sidesaddle or pillion for her,
not for Joe.	320.021625104985
First to the meet and in at the death.	64.95347154907657
Strong as a brood

Swagger around livery stables.	649.3094331003339
Toss
off a glass of brandy neat while you’d say knife.	293.32228010074107
That one at the
Grosvenor this morning.	144.04995449217557
Up with her on the car: wishswish.	127.58827382436509
Stonewall or
fivebarred gate put her mount to it.	245.75492640240574
Think that pugnosed driver did it
out of spite.	238.31943719885817
Who is this she was like?	84.19286527454447
O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that
sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel.	383.59033207008815
Divorced Spanish American.	494.0867752080217
Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling
them.	178.39322190196967
As if I was her clotheshorse.	261.24403623870734
Saw her in the viceregal party when
Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._
Scavenging what the quality left.	226.45483603011792
High tea.	108.18733242156206
Mayonnaise I poured on the
plums thinking it was custard.	302.81386095680705
Her ears ought to have tingled for a few
weeks after.	258.88507455969875
Want to be a bull for her.	78.47857214889915
Born courtesan.	365.4416887200119
No nursery work

Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband.	818.8726745219683
Method in his madness.	103.54839722288644
Saffron bun
and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy.	334.94994446750206
Eating
with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute.	255.37519527644764
And still his
muttonchop whiskers grew.	532.8788446774375
Supposed to be well connected.	142.32826723612348
Theodore’s
cousin in Dublin Castle.	302.0639026780235
One tony relative in every family.	453.6797866703145
Hardy
annuals he presents her with.	244.54524481939598
Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers
marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a
marketnet.	350.6511575335248
The squallers.	464.672675952932
Poor thing! Then having to give the breast
year after year all hours of the night.	204.50756172733597
Selfish those t.t’s are.	104.81580230230622
Dog in
the manger.	86.84733824511503
Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.	191.18080121867837
Luncheon interval.	266.01283497161296
A sixpenny at
Rowe’s?	333.2763402111117
Must look up that ad in the national library.	157.51232599381714
An eightpenny in
the Burton.	216.4901777403955
On my way.	85.03339547973737
He walked on past Bolton’s Westmoreland house.	320.44906601755275
I forgot
to tap Tom Kernan.	446.3734425116512
Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a
vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out.	484.36772099375787
Phew!
Dreadful simply! Child’s head too big: forceps.	484.9445043128012
Doubled up inside her
trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out.	256.5590100967077
Kill me
that would.	72.34458346342433

Here’s good luck.	134.17616087552688
Must be
thrilling from the air.	151.95269380352894
Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the

He gazed after the last broad tunic.	330.08815793141133

the young hornies.	199.7813907859724
That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was
given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money.	271.82693192797217
My word he did!
His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street.	391.3348803974966
Lucky I had
the presence of mind to dive into Manning’s or I was souped.	312.22905900945443
He did
come a wallop, by George.	244.9186983373755
Must have cracked his skull on the
cobblestones.	203.91248208379275
I oughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those
medicals.	350.9391530674461
And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards.	334.81757407354775

Right here it began.	128.26919987542928
—Up the Boers!

used to.	281.9589637719872
Whether on the scaffold high.	120.63797268670776
Never know who you’re talking to.	133.4584898859471
Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in
his eye.	253.2757734453713

castle.	220.62121285638437
Drop him like a hot potato.	153.46189671399432
Why those plainclothes men are
always courting slaveys.	643.6730582324125
Easily twig a man used to uniform.	226.3693309138375
Squarepushing up against a backdoor.	171.63911958330635
Maul her a bit.	60.99317571835466
Then the next
thing on the menu.	128.43056001376078
And who is the gentleman does be visiting there?	169.0207097382904
Was
the young master saying anything?	186.20948425476118
Peeping Tom through the keyhole.	261.0113666664783
Decoy duck.	186.15050521441842

—I don’t wear such things...	259.3344381381249
Stop or I’ll tell the missus on you.	178.2625978643818
Out
half the night.	80.71829925925493
—There are great times coming, Mary.	342.1735789609198
Wait till you see.	103.61785864003951
—Ah, gelong with your great times coming.	344.705296107639
Barmaids too.	56.16717052284047
James Stephens’ idea was the best.	167.83529060752497
He knew them.	112.21404465896745
Circles of ten so that
a fellow couldn’t round on more than his own ring.	169.3033335830573

Putting up in the
Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses.	293.45885100039715
You must have a certain fascination: Parnell.	301.0237804415374
Arthur Griffith is a
squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob.	172.72532773649723
Or gas about
our lovely land.	320.46745069686244
Gammon and spinach.	130.66522969128042
Dublin Bakery Company’s tearoom.	582.6704759078419

That republicanism is the best form of government.	230.54050506605444
That the language question should take precedence of the economic
question.	280.2968125992241
Have your daughters inveigling them to your house.	270.0018553796331
Stuff them
up with meat and drink.	135.1811225190324
Michaelmas goose.	236.73282115525478
Here’s a good lump of thyme
seasoning under the apron for you.	213.66807033534667

before it gets too cold.	358.4978944818256
Halffed enthusiasts.	365.4355909322164

with the band.	130.0041155486332
No grace for the carver.	181.53361679542022
The thought that the other chap
pays best sauce in the world.	185.68044360530035
Make themselves thoroughly at home.	297.85284859286764
Show
us over those apricots, meaning peaches.	549.8646916032593
The not far distant day.	231.24369308959425
Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	167.38878327920077
His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,
shadowing Trinity’s surly front.	479.3328254289689
Useless words.	89.42624163667524
Things go on same, day after day:
squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out.	289.25546425143995
Those two loonies
mooching about.	502.8255567792797
Dignam carted off.	379.30874065026404
Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed
groaning to have a child tugged out of her.	249.20029316795348
One born every second
somewhere.	310.3907965182966
Other dying every second.	268.7421464730579
Since I fed the birds five
minutes.	472.6191510581188
Three hundred kicked the bucket.	268.2871746297877
Other three hundred born,
washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling
maaaaaa.	271.30652616740525
Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other
coming on, passing on.	342.02383608918456
Changing hands.	80.88122368589796
This owner, that.	143.02962578441333
Other steps into his shoes when he gets
his notice to quit.	259.8387176957722
They buy the place up with gold and still they have
all the gold.	126.35079499053631
Swindle in it somewhere.	76.7520670010492
Piled up in cities, worn away
age after age.	360.0470106967877
Pyramids in sand.	91.97008387323251
Built on bread and onions.	144.84816662574286
Slaves
Chinese wall.	338.3515981124289
Big stones left.	217.16640761065048
Rest rubble,
sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt.	2172.345658577101
Shelter, for the night.	49.55295748899172
No-one is anything.	109.3515644797505
This is the very worst hour of the day.	111.19535751883564
Dull, gloomy: hate
this hour.	427.14181874181924
Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.	297.59760947202295
Provost’s house.	69.66585805680819
The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon.	1236.7946796689039
Well tinned in
there.	157.89657411796233
Like a mortuary chapel.	273.06847296774157
Wouldn’t live in it if they paid me.	139.83893776025712
Hope they have liver and bacon today.	226.8375573391144
Nature abhors a vacuum.	396.25765831179643
The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the
silverware opposite in Walter Sexton’s window by which John Howard
Parnell passed, unseeing.	586.902250719212
There he is: the brother.	61.645410162840655
Image of him.	33.590752399471135
Haunting face.	69.99694844279985
Now that’s a
coincidence.	83.39025634063876
Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don’t
meet him.	155.4296288927479
Like a man walking in his sleep.	108.65603862170346
They say he never put on the city marshal’s
uniform since he got the job.	188.9745175929341
Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his
high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved.	377.78549164022263
Look at the
woebegone walk of him.	121.03959679488476
Eaten a bad egg.	161.41802768062146
Poached eyes on ghost.	143.7321304089872
Great man’s brother: his brother’s brother.	150.4414817007664
He’d look nice on the
city charger.	237.71247303746532
Drop into the D.B.C.	350.91811141890173
probably for his coffee, play chess
there.	263.81446605695913
His brother used men as pawns.	376.8593043344927
Let them all go to pot.	140.86609132414662
Afraid to
pass a remark on him.	112.95363552507017
Freeze them up with that eye of his.	76.2369975719088
That’s the
fascination: the name.	85.19705791155445
All a bit touched.	125.8398591726185
Mad Fanny and his other
sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness.	462.3394053297681
Bolt upright
like surgeon M’Ardle.	751.2489109849587
Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath.	554.750854813782
Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life.	299.127965335618
The
patriot’s banquet.	427.3101041689693
Eating orangepeels in the park.	177.5975856894295
Simon Dedalus said
when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the
grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.	174.70681921201836
—Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which
the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks
with a Scotch accent.	208.2477644404882
The tentacles...	365.4416887200119
They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone.	340.6733598629497
Beard and
bicycle.	106.85577582864788
Young woman.	72.09755400552201
And there he is too.	72.36966116820939
Now that’s really a coincidence: second time.	166.50742622592645
Coming events cast their shadows before.	477.0258738320858
With the approval of the
eminent poet, Mr Geo.	297.2213874998863
That might be Lizzie Twigg with him.	236.34845668106584
E.: what does that mean?	136.45128684191548
Initials perhaps.	101.2844572487834
Albert Edward, Arthur
Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire.	1615.9391829393662
What was he saying?	81.69273702884102
The ends of the
world with a Scotch accent.	159.62819295923748
Tentacles: octopus.	317.5334699131929
Something occult:
symbolism.	973.2501590319478
Holding forth.	113.08424500649436
She’s taking it all in.	77.76282607613688
Not saying a word.	120.25059794660507
To
aid gentleman in literary work.	302.37823573702286
Coming from the vegetarian.	114.37697748351233
Only
weggebobbles and fruit.	337.645156598149
Don’t eat a beefsteak.	221.24531611202883
If you do the eyes of
that cow will pursue you through all eternity.	184.96563173590965
They say it’s healthier.	162.52184385308857
Windandwatery though.	77.88149046952233
Tried it.	30.60773084408939
Keep you on the run all day.	88.3557697403149
Bad as a
bloater.	136.08412546071534
Dreams all night.	78.9406004670938
Why do they call that thing they gave me
nutsteak?	217.4993947348488
To give you the idea you are eating
rumpsteak.	205.37192498346775
Salty too.	56.16717052284047
They cook in soda.	288.0000267286243
Keep you sitting by
the tap all night.	126.61686682355501
Her stockings are loose over her ankles.	333.1043290777419
I detest that: so tasteless.	392.0708304712183
Those literary etherial people they are all.	298.52267402809554
Dreamy, cloudy,
symbolistic.	973.2501590319478
Esthetes they are.	67.5661442860951
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that
kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.	185.4177809033929
For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their
shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him.	333.1834207743504
Don’t know
what poetry is even.	181.05828399997108
Must be in a certain mood.	140.65678768915652
Waves o’er the waters dull.	218.47508562451227
He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of
Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses.	321.262115292873
Or will I drop into old
Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair?	294.29054766050433
Wellmannered fellow.	83.79921129302102
Probably at his lunch.	118.19599568751956
Must get those old glasses of mine set right.	240.87487139126767
Goerz lenses six guineas.	732.798322875629
Germans making their way everywhere.	294.9066886187752
Sell on
easy terms to capture trade.	363.2679046061331
Might chance on a pair in
the railway lost property office.	224.69482818478537
Astonishing the things people leave
behind them in trains and cloakrooms.	257.03698329991056
What do they be thinking about?	147.50868229697173
Women too.	56.16717052284047
Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up
that farmer’s daughter’s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.	251.47228927385714
Unclaimed money too.	123.24212973934347
There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the
bank to test those glasses by.	156.61713624136672
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides.	272.00683257626855
Can’t see it.	76.23685532262606
If
you imagine it’s there you can almost see it.	139.4325468200427
Can’t see it.	76.23685532262606
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right
hand at arm’s length towards the sun.	252.92972595033805
Wanted to try that often.	121.996435155448
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk.	229.87631928842845
Must be the focus where the rays cross.	209.60638167197644
If I had black glasses.	339.53536049583624
There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were
in Lombard street west.	234.99427181733634
Looking up from the back garden.	108.63046764487675

Must go out there
some first Saturday of the month.	162.93615218899254
If I could get an introduction to

Show this gentleman the door.	104.31719403958832
His hand fell to his side again.	149.14225232938003
Never know anything about it.	126.85588534276789
Waste of time.	46.52391743424545
Gasballs spinning about,
crossing each other, passing.	475.05981758289107
Same old dingdong always.	278.44225976485023
Gas: then
solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen
rock, like that pineapple rock.	534.4153288680898
The moon.	128.26396576228953
Must be a new moon out, she
said.	119.80457669243899
I believe there is.	111.89391553699186
He went on by la maison Claire.	361.036674531455
The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly
there is a new moon.	268.5686930251943
Walking down by the Tolka.	113.10058993577265
Not bad for a Fairview
moon.	210.70677571831433
She was humming.	166.5206918142391
The young May moon she’s beaming, love.	351.69300529890546

Glowworm’s la-amp is gleaming, love.	383.2840892129066
If it was it was.	49.16809431254311
Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.	1337.4302212014231
With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here
middle of the day of Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders.	244.40995870798247
On his annual bend,
M’Coy said.	478.8475378160554
They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la

Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the
rest of the year sober as a judge.	162.3686327490573
Thought so.	50.1242710750977
Sloping into the Empire.	121.60200162746507
Plain soda would do him
good.	215.35782679694194
Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
Queen’s.	451.5351024726385

How time flies,
eh?	308.28562305701183
Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts.	381.04884398916914
Drinkers, drinking,
laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath.	477.9138313299781
More power, Pat.	298.7764186747809
Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke.	460.79625138615444
Take off that white
hat.	133.78734912189674
His parboiled eyes.	389.65148105248073
Where is he now?	61.384250693482485
Beggar somewhere.	116.57752279513628
The harp
that once did starve us all.	296.9901864341935
I was happier then.	183.0936891007396
Or was that I?	117.7086484191082
Or am I now I?	414.1616707030868
Twentyeight I was.	145.86353326617092
She twentythree.	464.672675952932
When we left Lombard street west something changed.	422.6348963258847
Could never like it again after Rudy.	195.20122945464203
Can’t bring back time.	172.4637222086395
Like
holding water in your hand.	167.34787624194018
Would you go back to then?	94.55268024023192
Would you?	32.76073075102579
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty
boy?	207.27223179012114
Wants to sew on buttons for me.	187.55332715915492
I must answer.	168.2145747732626
Write it in the
library.	64.27408295355022
Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses.	615.3684795726679
Muslin prints,
silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in
the baking causeway.	805.4818521721495
Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.	150.23921897857352

Cascades of ribbons.	126.87457849743876
Flimsy China silks.	730.7867991142465
A tilted urn poured from its
mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood.	669.9822516678371
The huguenots
brought that here.	265.21537038219265
_La causa è santa!_ Tara tara.	1086.3158873561324
Great chorus that.	163.83492051196077
Taree tara.	226.01551738765664
Must be washed in rainwater.	243.8392432810466
I’m a long time threatening to buy one.	191.7087756728739
Sticking them all
over the place.	86.70939484141508
Needles in window curtains.	193.38221721468844
He bared slightly his left forearm.	432.63787844652643
Scrape: nearly gone.	277.23581982916687
Not today
anyhow.	224.63010847050055
Must go back for that lotion.	152.80940726138428
For her birthday perhaps.	235.1524847949427
Junejulyaugseptember eighth.	317.5334699131929
Nearly three months off.	217.19450526266505
Then she mightn’t
like it.	148.089605476764
Women won’t pick up pins.	334.6134014178474
Say it cuts lo.	316.95846206208427
Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk
stockings.	855.2171211588799
Useless to go back.	80.92421644226322
Had to be.	39.782525819573834

Wealth of the world.	37.93394181205637
A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain.	419.92533644165496
His brain yielded.	563.7183695585346
Perfume of embraces all him assailed.	216.13337993239065
With hungered flesh obscurely, he
mutely craved to adore.	826.346637836
Duke street.	64.81816915559368
Here we are.	81.3643636215788
Must eat.	126.17886980988847
The Burton.	203.15938669399281
Feel better then.	110.79933778540092
He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued.	394.4220113426922
Jingling, hoofthuds.	365.4416887200119
Perfumed bodies, warm, full.	366.5895300102885
All kissed, yielded: in deep summer
fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements,
along sofas, creaking beds.	1029.0657427111757
—Jack, love!
	78.01990710471843
—Kiss me, Reggy!
	176.19100763337974
—My boy!
	98.02836074931062
His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant.	223.7511161198989
Stink
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens.	854.8592428368939
See
the animals feed.	187.11532653224089
Men, men, men.	145.56248082377812
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables
calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy
food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches.	598.0155447019197
A pallid suetfaced
young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.	557.9654873169408
New set of microbes.	192.30027355326897
A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked
round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet.	534.4983862827582
A man spitting back
on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew
it.	477.725078823321
Chump chop from the grill.	247.7796887616825
Bolting to get it over.	74.38693666020397
Sad booser’s
eyes.	216.94352010849477
Bitten off more than he can chew.	214.0306669069847
See ourselves
as others see us.	257.8367113125265
Hungry man is an angry man.	174.78031714860782
Working tooth and jaw.	293.7702797153029
Don’t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the
schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne.	567.3134040185619
Wonder what
he was eating.	98.42604273730991
Something galoptious.	464.672675952932
Saint Patrick converted him to
Christianity.	374.25654843491066
Couldn’t swallow it all however.	200.52103434483345
—Roast beef and cabbage.	223.83580297487157
—One stew.	266.003957838601
Smells of men.	56.50981599685634
His gorge rose.	561.3132395984687
Couldn’t eat a morsel here.	220.2496023554443
Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
before him, old chap picking his tootles.	370.66027176203403
Slight spasm, full, chewing
the cud.	445.00472075823666
Before and after.	46.58911173848391
Grace after meals.	208.42648815622758
Look on this picture then
on that.	116.89016172141586
Lick it
off the plate, man! Get out of this.	146.57035514248258
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of
his nose.	340.6652316133099
—Two stouts here.	399.07173415006065
—One corned and cabbage.	313.6070152602539
That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended
on it.	268.57234903474506
Good stroke.	266.0083962612288
Give me the fidgets to look.	109.1928781979976
Safer to eat from his
three hands.	131.11691486894563
Second nature to him.	81.321608692963
Born with a
silver knife in his mouth.	121.38895197073677
That’s witty, I think.	345.0903574144867
Or no.	48.149160651800685
Silver means
born rich.	350.21337466110293
But then the allusion is lost.	146.61600312185647
Rock, the head
bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.	276.6521318156231
Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot.	290.7232611035643
A diner, knife and fork
upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the
foodlift across his stained square of newspaper.	494.73549030846425
Other chap telling him
something with his mouth full.	199.60111051571715

Did you, faith?	117.74959222438862
Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips.	350.8994894832677
His eyes said:
	75.27789580587826
—Not here.	64.56289892777333
Don’t see him.	83.20922587250402
I hate dirty eaters.	621.1311506069121
He backed towards the door.	216.26424856244577
Get a light snack in Davy Byrne’s.	273.68472591159053
Keep me going.	89.89577208850045
Had a good breakfast.	118.07981643093771
—Roast and mashed here.	159.95111833305128
—Pint of stout.	94.47167657529502
Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail.	214.86175524373937
He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.	319.2087818323133
Kill! Kill!
	203.15938669399281
Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps.	288.34920062173535
All trotting down

Never know whose thoughts you’re
chewing.	333.89647607909154
Then who’d wash up all the plates and forks?	218.7581227352205
Might be all

round hall, naked goddesses.	350.6368061491868
Aids to digestion.	149.53288514735237
They don’t care what
man looks.	216.6740229525514
All to see.	48.29364062089027
Never speaking.	156.74239962289175
I mean to say to fellows like
Flynn.	204.77752292845582
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	210.2389811031048
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	218.01465527644407
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods
golden dishes, all ambrosial.	691.2615616962823
Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled
mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	476.4503527144324
Nectar imagine it
drinking electricity: gods’ food.	614.8407948423295
Lovely forms of women sculped
Junonian.	455.17283461604774
Immortal lovely.	103.10709526075975
And we stuffing food in one hole and out
behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like
stoking an engine.	462.0121271533345
They have no.	71.94840608686489
Never looked.	91.11788356615433
I’ll look today.	197.2950820542683
Keeper
won’t see.	141.13116821266425
Bend down let something fall see if she.	199.64700174302635
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do
there to do.	156.30565428895866
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	266.08173673723724
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
	216.98605865147582
—What is this he is?	65.53182627771149
Isn’t he in the insurance line?	110.79727712441179
—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	185.6529598252478
He does canvassing for
the _Freeman._
	197.45122740409255
Is he in trouble?	75.75327329015714
Not that I heard of.	132.2036071715512
—I noticed he was in mourning.	127.32425121549113
—Was he?	25.706179759234487
So he was, faith.	89.26449119298415
I asked him how was all at
home.	127.24341867211588
You’re right, by God.	242.79562072969495
So he was.	35.441684332301406
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
gentleman is in trouble that way.	341.70810458430896
It only brings it up fresh in their
minds.	230.48825953988938
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	213.08732749004207
I met him the day before
yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
to his better half.	249.593001476176
She’s well nourished, I tell you.	286.583757574275
Plovers on toast.	156.14796659160004
—And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.	194.08088917956354
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.	266.96359283448635
You can make bacon of
that.	141.80034158745696
—How so?	50.1242710750977
He
winked.	249.71993668557914
—He’s in the craft, he said.	76.53435400028455
Davy Byrne said.	165.5081573229974
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	318.71966544189655
Ancient free and accepted order.	239.92190912445722
He’s
an excellent brother.	188.17768390429313
Light, life and love, by God.	169.15382549520683
They give him a leg
up.	120.08370371084501
I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.	175.46717418096662
—Is that a fact?	68.35518203370583
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	217.65421462997713
They stick to you when you’re
down.	126.65693882790633
I know a fellow was trying to get into it.	124.02798384453094
But they’re as close
as damn it.	179.0269302104988
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	129.65297637081156
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
	273.7365448313859
—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
out what they do be doing.	240.38765761657524
But be damned but they smelt her out and
swore her in on the spot a master mason.	191.03859853158002
That was one of the saint
Legers of Doneraile.	137.2504137632017
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
	423.8760861708817
—And is that a fact?	73.15418869672683
Decent quiet man he is.	111.54831369527056
I often saw him in here
and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.	182.64109108198346
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	550.2735675624245
Slips
off when the fun gets too hot.	233.09470812326126
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?	118.37437192442931
Ah, you weren’t there.	167.61117244660912
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he
does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	160.94081679960883
Declare to
God he does.	133.10303254807909
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	225.83360801756908
He’s a safe man, I’d say.	222.1453073593262
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	266.8588558572228
He’s been known
to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	147.84797744039798
Give the devil his due.	118.30489858898954
O,
Bloom has his good points.	240.16702825746916
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.	125.94720935412406
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	521.9287666238728
—I know, Davy Byrne said.	325.49088169101054
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	207.31856266281045
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	292.99218467801927
Tom Rochford followed frowning,
a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	433.8837734307467
—Day, Mr Byrne.	494.0867752080217
—Day, gentlemen.	141.33088670420966
They paused at the counter.	172.86184890112906
—Who’s standing?	98.40007094539712
Paddy Leonard asked.	255.87999104604643
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	604.0149908597751
—Well, what’ll it be?	90.1181079985446
Paddy Leonard asked.	255.87999104604643
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	388.9911833427273
—How much?	79.33166529084998
Paddy Leonard cried.	310.64141921768265
Since when, for God’ sake?	257.744811400191
What’s
yours, Tom?	259.29220585834287
—How is the main drainage?	201.60837202754055
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	556.3300929953725
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
hiccupped.	371.5377548100391
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	327.1005730725884
—Certainly, sir.	71.8721773002824
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	513.0813363205082
—Lord love a duck, he said.	112.4125156087243
Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold
water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	478.40722947883427
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	246.40950413042577
A dead snip.	375.7565580768978
Nosey Flynn asked.	255.87999104604643
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set
before him.	359.9236451500363
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	380.13869413182425
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	276.6919335213385
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	330.66889194664776
—Is it Zinfandel?	140.3907322034375
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	804.4444175228065
I’m going to plunge five bob on my
own.	243.5699014905685
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
said.	246.37904200443134
Who gave it to you?	69.05562315434138
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	259.2978442882473
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.	339.69982223246876
The others turned.	184.66979647154307
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.	175.1100087414735
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	371.3344299534288
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two
of your small Jamesons after that and a...	200.103220241238
—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	1282.2003186584557
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	339.27239792854846
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
smooth.	517.0799793901143
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	171.32355546967335
Then with
those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	358.6540278893772
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	473.05554831495454
Returned with thanks
having fully digested the contents.	410.28283860711844
First sweet then savoury.	303.1826409895384
Mr Bloom
coasted warily.	1140.872575554076
His second course.	155.4431231999244
Their upper jaw they
move.	453.0138382688427
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.	208.25209523291122
Lean people long
mouths.	333.5770737108686
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and
invent free.	190.07323334754375
Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.	215.24535443480153
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
	389.0262710580463
Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
	467.9192503236492
M’invitasti.	464.672675952932
Feel better.	85.52706137596047
Good pick me up.	150.4673291990615
Who distilled first?	405.1537254231651
Some chap
in the blues.	143.5913011804694
Dutch courage.	226.01551738765664
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
library now I must.	349.47264877959344
They could: and watch it all the way
down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour
round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric
juice coils of intestines like pipes.	465.5299440275046
But the poor buffer would have to
stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	205.06990904877958
—_A cenar teco._
	403.4748378256972
What does that _teco_ mean?	303.78137701446207
Tonight perhaps.	101.2844572487834
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
	618.5428554356482
To come to supper tonight,
	234.30996115550613
The rum the rumdum.	266.4983463756805
Doesn’t go properly.	197.3097802627151
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	322.5665117070572
That’ll be two pounds ten about
two pounds eight.	334.22114504989827
Three Hynes owes me.	476.0107314203245
Two eleven.	131.69102189042172
Prescott’s dyeworks
van over there.	255.55900159995429
If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen.	547.9216798810431
Five guineas
about.	195.6604293122455
On the pig’s back.	98.18249687496541
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
garters.	302.4780932140058
Not think.	83.17738053065523
Tour the south then.	82.96084426672302
What about English wateringplaces?	592.0171523770576
Brighton,
Margate.	203.15938669399281
Piers by moonlight.	162.3963651425724
Her voice floating out.	216.78259846293008
Those lovely
seaside girls.	372.4680772294899
Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	684.8032431154344
Handy man wants job.	242.3382652529307
Small wages.	464.672675952932
Will eat anything.	220.10439244574266
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.	471.1869406419693
_Why I left the
church of Rome?	214.39445849049054
Birds’ Nest._ Women run him.	296.50298194453615
They say they used to give
pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato
blight.	225.1655956982692
Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor
jews.	160.8605321406988
Same bait.	365.4416887200119
Why we left the church of Rome.	146.77923941090606
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.	377.9686959742172
No
tram in sight.	185.38112855485375
Wants to cross.	89.07223485747949
—Do you want to cross?	116.98502067261943
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
The blind stripling did not answer.	300.3901612489759
His wallface frowned weakly.	1287.7594438799638
He
moved his head uncertainly.	245.1249455069875
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	358.80213720777755
Molesworth street is opposite.	151.81631122653968
Do you want to cross?	116.98502067261943
There’s nothing in the way.	68.22804825348747
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	219.56671426658048
Where I
saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	364.31479226818453
Horse drooping.	249.72410360095353
Driver in
John Long’s.	198.68790333723064
Slaking his drouth.	133.37287205213653
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.	206.83726126487582
I’ll see you
across.	148.43120345856124
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?	145.21395267436188
—Yes, the stripling answered.	154.69866049936934
South Frederick street.	230.69763418536934
—Come, Mr Bloom said.	339.27239792854846
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
guide it forward.	337.2501818826011
Say something to him.	68.62797336215918
Better not do the condescending.	138.76043760587865
They mistrust
what you tell them.	229.5821877380568
—The rain kept off.	308.72688984413924
No answer.	118.11431857441268
Stains on his coat.	88.60908987074554
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	289.41723000126933
Tastes all different
for him.	101.90273232929306
Have to be spoonfed first.	165.13618259884933
Like a child’s hand, his hand.	96.32664984327981
Like
Milly’s was.	117.6809925135684
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	246.6527877478536
Wonder if
he has a name.	84.8170442158121
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired
drudge get his doze.	312.4420379359386
That’s right.	65.80044832232244
Behind a bull: in front of a
horse.	106.50755917419981
—Thanks, sir.	71.8721773002824
Knows I’m a man.	151.76169506978613
—Right now?	56.330396450281164
First turn to the left.	81.08267384254161
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
his cane back, feeling again.	290.9976266782823
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
tweed.	523.4505483842482
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	213.92174483892506
Must have felt it.	107.04509013594337
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
of volume.	239.3687972250149
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	160.19300340391572
Queer
idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	192.17698326295093
Could
he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane?	180.19663934090096
Bloodless pious face like
a fellow going in to be a priest.	144.76636990448318
Penrose! That was that chap’s name.	164.3581232375233
Read with their fingers.	105.04049172065199
Tune pianos.	365.4416887200119
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	260.5052777739042
Why we think a
deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might
say.	278.15101191325726
Plait baskets.	365.4416887200119
People ought to help.	150.95014803255373
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.	399.3320564571559
Hates sewing.	464.672675952932
Might take an objection.	272.19708569157285
Dark men they call them.	146.32822538622366
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	221.93071679862513
Smells on all sides, bunched
together.	295.0259528962493
Each street different smell.	255.25986631013689
Each person too.	142.36630021402328
Then the
spring, the summer: smells.	173.6297107072357
They say you can’t taste wines with
your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	190.63080195094486
Also smoke in the dark they say
get no pleasure.	168.95161818307062
More shameless not seeing.	439.30679761204345
Look at me.	58.00099012722535
I have
them all on.	78.35545095969574
Must be strange not to see her.	115.18326272902345
Kind of a form in his
mind’s eye.	90.20628473876874
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	237.35732366500557
His hands on her hair,
for instance.	148.10075287409632
Say it was black, for instance.	116.2610033319034
We call it black.	127.16573858516256
Then passing over her white skin.	222.23212252941778
Different feel perhaps.	183.8085732694115
Feeling of
white.	56.112926026303626
Must answer.	118.11431857441268
Fag today.	104.97859235390712
Send her a postal order two
shillings, half a crown.	234.6326573410799
Accept my little present.	155.93719914014315
Stationer’s just
here too.	113.41302058925739
Think over it.	59.30734575771054
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
his ears.	286.7667701432146
Then gently his finger felt
the skin of his right cheek.	189.79724840158264
Downy hair there too.	126.3687882041128
Not smooth enough.	326.4698797304599
The belly is the smoothest.	181.13834569408618
No-one about.	75.21370651634336
There he goes into Frederick
street.	229.0914779238489
Might be settling
my braces.	364.1550124074574
Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
his belly.	299.04398726273814
Want to try in the dark to
see.	75.56778281191826
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	179.37760759368385
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	212.83773708137994
Really terrible.	156.7450148303008
What dreams would
he have, not seeing?	206.90521942355556
Life a dream for him.	89.39387387950045
Where is the justice being
born that way?	148.34261612437442
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
and drowned in New York.	511.25252300140573
Karma they call that transmigration
for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	251.30146915538532
Dear, dear, dear.	191.99981682486606
Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to
them someway.	202.93483556488707
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall.	433.3437044068465
Solemn as Troy.	166.81739156925525
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	289.7727749098233
Old legal cronies cracking a
magnum.	697.5792621626391
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat
school.	182.18045474927217
I sentenced him to ten years.	258.79988866396064
I suppose he’d turn up his nose
at that stuff I drank.	262.8498360928136
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
dusty bottle.	217.46579792595412
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.	170.55984784021118
Wellmeaning old man.	85.91838969967048
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their
percentage manufacturing crime.	996.7671411997314
Sends them to the rightabout.	93.70838020449582
The devil
on moneylenders.	303.2978977882394
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	476.7593641846715
Now he’s really
what they call a dirty jew.	168.752553696649
Power those judges have.	237.43128721561666
Bear with a sore paw.	177.2086249399107
And may the Lord have mercy on your
soul.	221.14561706359402
Hello, placard.	464.672675952932
Mirus bazaar.	196.39217042896712
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	214.36995746371022
Today it is.	44.17687065229445
_The
Messiah_ was first given for that.	174.85711025194584
What about going out
there: Ballsbridge.	199.2614591290093
Drop in on Keyes.	106.7518235529819
No use sticking to him like a
leech.	211.66595334181977
Sure to know someone on the gate.	115.34044624166897
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	289.02435713017957
First I must.	243.89566499920753
Straw hat in sunlight.	147.90577093547546
Tan shoes.	164.52428259081285
Turnedup trousers.	118.92179920641561
It is.	37.17489727918392
It is.	37.17489727918392
His heart quopped softly.	543.8034311088423
To the right.	43.414838253756116
He swerved
to the right.	113.22518399167326
Is it?	30.60773084408939
Almost certain.	121.47120052766316
Won’t look.	97.32135722655981
Wine in my face.	72.02834011667751
Too
heady.	464.672675952932
Yes, it is.	44.17687065229445
The walk.	106.5591390796162
Not see.	56.50786883456539
Get on.	32.610077424956444
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	222.82063100900936
Handsome building.	249.72410360095353
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	963.3025413524857
Not following me?	140.06441692329904
Didn’t see me perhaps.	136.2456436481733
Light in his eyes.	51.36273214457983
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	276.93268363194824
Cold
statues: quiet there.	300.3866356407677
Safe in a minute.	71.71022438433042
Didn’t see me.	90.4250458657011
After two.	58.75389545447496
Just at the gate.	75.82965180369118
My heart!
	86.90266822808451
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	462.8016398086694
Sir
Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	500.1156642187206
Look for something I.	192.19897383651247
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
Agendath Netaim.	490.4865678938219
Where did I?	214.3612385928177
Busy looking.	89.99539184205464
He thrust back quick Agendath.	482.85574071088865
Afternoon she said.	55.29788464652819
I am looking for that.	111.81611842638019
Yes, that.	29.63054047888148
Try all pockets.	130.51678739702814
_Freeman._
Where did I?	283.5154699987906
Ah, yes.	60.45787357664621
Walk quietly.	138.29686755620725
Moment more.	63.180440657542185
My heart.	86.90266822808451
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap
lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	337.5294858242407
Ah soap there I yes.	304.71731069748256
Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
	303.39043850698783
—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	322.04776019891057
A great poet on a great brother poet.	247.40734097188647
A hesitating soul taking arms
against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
real life.	477.050928574369
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	316.55046626728233
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
noiseless beck.	449.6648712106084
—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	292.14018115760376
The beautiful
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	698.4705041914826
One always
feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true.	357.7601102625473
True in the larger analysis.	182.54455522349937
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	376.52090349538554
Bald, most zealous by the door
he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was
gone.	176.40143988190138
Two left.	79.16734286126419
—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
before his death.	691.3581822652228
—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
elder’s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?	595.501059904273
_The Sorrows
of Satan_ he calls it.	193.80474693819153
Smile Cranly’s smile.	228.82850667657127
First he tickled her
	116.6947605267085
Then he patted her
	133.01649908628414
Then he passed the female catheter
	189.04681876951682
For he was a medical
	75.30592175423001
Jolly old medi...	298.2276727372766
—I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
mystic mind.	257.0813471953738
The shining seven W.B.	768.902693652541
calls them.	48.46073965995688
Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed.	750.5623326391633
He
laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.	454.56149848525916
Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
	491.34158488779394
Tears such as angels weep.	367.41541416096885
Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.	3083.8582270585252
He holds my follies hostage.	659.4836833926012
Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland.	355.5785050606003
Gaptoothed
Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.	277.14451338895014
And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve.	370.68907973681905
In the
shadow of the glen he cooees for them.	133.22213374492833
My soul’s youth I gave him,
night by night.	265.34304293778473
God speed.	287.40150812754337
Good hunting.	249.72410360095353
Mulligan has my telegram.	200.15170672215723
—Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet
though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	564.2292307357905
—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
shadow.	561.0041343793959
I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	610.3239169249777
Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus.	190.49917646139804
Art has to reveal
to us ideas, formless spiritual essences.	554.1614608664536
The supreme question about a
work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.	217.0653271218796
The painting of
Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas.	329.66103631309204
The deepest poetry of Shelley,
the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas.	396.86019935693565
All the rest is the speculation of
schoolboys for schoolboys.	181.48734566040145
has been telling some yankee interviewer.	514.863156098689
Wall, tarnation strike
me!
	534.1617573487501
—The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	765.3667783839088
Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.	280.547971108706
—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	581.3569836768269
One
can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	242.87427556210542
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	240.95853558477066
Formless spiritual.	249.72410360095353
Father, Word and Holy Breath.	408.26256885177355
Allfather, the
heavenly man.	126.88128263181876
Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
suffers in us at every moment.	301.31534002191444
This verily is that.	167.98192342570226
I am the fire upon
the altar.	146.71816630960214
I am the sacrificial butter.	256.5565995469723
Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
secret to adepts.	554.6358118227494
The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
plane of buddhi.	458.1995371915543
The life esoteric is not for ordinary person.	325.5435762160292
O.P.	203.15938669399281

Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
illustrious sister H.P.B.’s elemental.	1092.664861142835
O, fie! Out on’t! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you
naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.	389.92631463231527
Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	671.8502986890411
He bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	279.87411902280144
—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.	542.8762075621661
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
	849.6450560543221
—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato.	428.4594747189489
—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?	218.4494362565929
Unsheathe your dagger definitions.	570.3047436738892
Horseness is the whatness of
allhorse.	168.42519339526393
Streams of tendency and eons they worship.	263.59570642336985
God: noise in the
street: very peripatetic.	193.3526815688057
Space: what you damn well have to see.	124.262818134695
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they
creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this
vegetable world is but a shadow.	418.0612321909827
Hold to the now, the here, through
which all future plunges to the past.	126.53609953911723
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	549.0565517946675
—Haines is gone, he said.	82.96086375965984
—I was showing him Jubainville’s book.	212.1494094451746
He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t
you know, about Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn’t bring him in
to hear the discussion.	259.33349893532227
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.	131.57463477812442
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
	505.914244575235
To greet the callous public.	426.72127539101024
Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish
	621.5715817700045
In lean unlovely English.	877.6720137169152
—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	480.0515858431995
We feel in England.	180.16255968139976
Penitent thief.	266.01283497161296
I smoked his baccy.	433.7393624693513
Green
twinkling stone.	434.8664200405879
An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	125.50165058537185
—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
Russell warned occultly.	560.5379976286137
The movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on
the hillside.	209.69542588667298
For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
living mother.	197.2621502347277
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce
the sixshilling novel, the musichall song.	379.9490068703686
France produces the finest
flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed
only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.	232.81621639215666
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	522.0760534030363
—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	327.2619225573547
The one about
_Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don’t
you know, _reading the book of himself_.	729.8249373279228
He describes _Hamlet_ given in
a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.	384.3339517609611
They advertised it.	206.8903192239897
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	465.68568189891937
_Hamlet
ou
Le Distrait
Pièce de Shakespeare_
	1433.2334151653274
He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:
	664.3595679333371
—_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don’t you know.	224.0684370822586
It’s so French.	145.73183947544487
The French
point of view.	279.6700554019712
_Hamlet ou_...	464.672675952932
—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	1077.1110220147214
—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	146.2224598687143
Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	471.37382878249184
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	291.4492712491018
—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	362.5952118505934
Not
for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palms.	248.807205951516
Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.	164.13580400505822
Our Father who art in purgatory.	329.2808200616705
Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.	368.74502737868835
The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.	540.4254453857025
Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	657.2777369027058
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
	471.5832170264413
But we had spared...	229.13367423854606
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	357.18860146117896
The devil and the deep sea.	139.28686569420995
—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for
Mr Best’s behoof.	364.6595197918205
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
flesh creep.	248.56901128592375
List! List! O List!
	770.5244035147354
My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	805.5272733682663
If thou didst ever...	401.2623173231935
—What is a ghost?	87.39888171190178
Stephen said with tingling energy.	276.7384271168809
One who has faded
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners.	448.8338336590544
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin.	627.3043717275145
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,
returning to the world that has forgotten him?	225.74170524580245
Who is King Hamlet?	329.8458660981343
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	516.5266598773628
—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a

The flag is up on the playhouse by the

Work in all you know.	63.61017922871851
Make them accomplices.	277.23892240017193
—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks
by the swanmews along the riverbank.	238.13681028334332
But he does not stay to feed the
pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	291.11197141029845
The swan of Avon
has other thoughts.	396.5390399537149
Composition of place.	59.38654010669671
Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
	324.6824613380205
—The play begins.	334.07163332710996
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	239.3242996764745
It is
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	179.8927155159961
He speaks the words to
Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of
cerecloth, calling him by a name:
	263.11025344854176
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,
	331.705540627545
bidding him list.	136.1167453029042
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	212.6461551990763
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	335.62597569325004
—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.	297.8908047459958
Art thou there, truepenny?	337.17132183042696
—Interesting only to the parish clerk.	175.37800414361024
I mean, we have the plays.	157.24882905396822
I
mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the
poet lived?	214.64125757956273
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts.	246.1985877503753
We have _King Lear_: and it is
immortal.	234.45052161488195
Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.	326.94276257821883
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,
	146.96241280313043
Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	494.0867752080217
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	264.87637585896107
Marry, I wanted it.	218.8268904147851
Take thou this noble.	261.72657430049986
Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s
daughter.	301.80261455892446
Agenbite of inwit.	109.87096133473105
Do you intend to pay it back?	168.4406305880547
O, yes.	60.45787357664621
When, then?	51.270025270301566
I paid my way.	164.15063209575266
I paid my way.	164.15063209575266
Steady on.	32.610077424956444
He’s from beyant Boyne water.	319.266279777275
The northeast corner.	448.2964997481897
You owe

Five months.	152.28278157433402
Molecules all change.	112.68983379205137
I am other I now.	256.98601434137527

But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under
everchanging forms.	650.2622799905074
I that sinned and prayed and fasted.	220.32615112374984
A child Conmee saved from pandies.	620.57893460765

—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?	142.79107053604216
John Eglinton’s carping voice asked.	378.31859370532317
Her ghost at least has been laid
for ever.	266.1165405223695
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	234.19448929982798
She
saw him into and out of the world.	77.39292349673534
She took his first embraces.	208.795685845729
Mother’s deathbed.	162.5045248939141
The sheeted mirror.	620.5772564015308
Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers.	447.173702797544
_Liliata
rutilantium._
	164.22196255423694
I wept alone.	411.6755494701274
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	238.23310929057513
—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.	162.2609639411542
—Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	351.0884830815022
His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	277.5952663410486
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	375.6583259470152
—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine.	548.7566804293064
What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?	717.6857317146155
—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world.	192.37580160291685
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
know.	347.8993969481479
But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	359.64364086103495
—But Ann Hathaway?	494.0867752080217
Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.	369.562615655366
Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	268.57460475852105
His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
guiltless though maligned.	506.4365800620093
—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	284.0123966492995
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of
hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	324.1920300125573
That memory, _Venus
and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.	240.31514043981565
Is
Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	446.2773311226816
Hortensio calls her young and
beautiful.	164.744274125171
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	221.67552272923734
Good: he left her
and gained the world of men.	109.37113042487694
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	125.44658149707499
He chose badly?	563.7970672332062
He
was chosen, it seems to me.	152.15412718815514
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	264.22286860200455
By cock, she was to blame.	162.86196098772456
She put the comether on him, sweet and
twentysix.	207.1884866852513
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	546.2618101304254
And my turn?	117.43699100474483
—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.	829.7268703340449
He murmured then with blond delight for all:
	260.6922353535308
Between the acres of the rye
	108.09308025375512
These pretty countryfolk would lie.	509.0568817534507
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	331.00220196571354
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
cooperative watch.	533.5069369439134
—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._
	308.47416754573203
Whither away?	76.49013325525952
Exploitable ground.	134.18866311907203
—Are you going?	74.06606713742035
John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked.	507.5076597635288
Shall we see you
at Moore’s tonight?	189.49784545271675
Piper is coming.	88.7796438529052
—Piper! Mr Best piped.	916.4578019198775
Is Piper back?	219.85902491523106
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	516.9042610453306
—I don’t know if I can.	227.43597478138858
We have our meeting.	173.37623165982592
If I can get
away in time.	208.37682008762943
Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.	304.8708088653405
_Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we

Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an

Gulfer of souls, engulfer.	249.19420246994542
Hesouls,

Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,

Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses.	508.2359592147804
We are all looking
forward anxiously.	280.6102069139976
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
lighted, shone.	322.43252391173206
See this.	54.159510926722085
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
ashplanthandle over his knee.	352.1162337069359
My casque and sword.	386.0699306733607
Aristotle’s experiment.	182.05595427877563

Necessity is
that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	154.86013932354118
Argal, one hat is one hat.	136.1827566913358
Young Colum and Starkey.	249.5976425755857
George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	281.81039217108406
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he?	166.41789232040375
I
liked Colum’s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	420.69264230235257
Do
you think he has genius really?	199.1128998366917
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild
earth a Grecian vase_.	481.20600199264237
Did he?	25.706179759234487
I hope you’ll be able to come tonight.	229.1623551095474
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	214.60774430963465
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	196.931997506177
Did
you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn?	398.63119290973384
That Moore is
Martyn’s wild oats?	429.6597909411885
Awfully clever, isn’t it?	222.6946348965358
They remind one of Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza.	418.2726501023928
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr
Sigerson says.	485.74359755732075
Moore is the man for it.	55.21568413311619
A knight of the rueful
countenance here in Dublin.	288.0408954264064
With a saffron kilt?	349.1983950854044
O’Neill Russell?	494.0867752080217
O,
yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.	184.22040424791538
And his Dulcinea?	131.6894783433127
James
Stephens is doing some clever sketches.	545.7969847534275
We are becoming important, it
seems.	366.99789227773283
_Cordoglio._ Lir’s loneliest daughter.	335.09351564078185
Now your best French polish.	498.6982298899959
—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	438.16316985448356
If you will be
so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...	175.0469385394186
—O, yes.	60.45787357664621
If he considers it important it will go in.	185.02626067834044
We have so much
correspondence.	244.69071396268095
—I understand, Stephen said.	275.75322508320664
God ild you.	254.07674573488057
The pigs’ paper.	347.7785527443778
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too.	308.60698934462846
Are we going to be
read?	118.20623097517613
I feel we are.	134.59795918227218
The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.	508.5521913964894
I hope
you will come round tonight.	233.27265422757216
Bring Starkey.	203.15938669399281
Stephen sat down.	152.77358494980007
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	317.3503686822033
Blushing, his mask
said:
	147.7797065098975
—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	540.5767202840656
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
	274.18405718109244
—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	143.27286490067428
Alarmed face asks me.	229.9701550842072
Why did he come?	83.63021756146934
Courtesy or an inward light?	217.76847482397275
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.	230.8851315787415
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
from hue and cry.	477.80619868695044
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	326.7941576951553
Women
he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters’ wives.	397.94150121087335
Fox and geese.	108.963951572148
And in New Place a slack
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
grave and unforgiven.	430.09664183667155
So you think...	77.64402372845808
The door closed behind the outgoer.	289.05483766623894
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.	507.7796567581134
A vestal’s lamp.	325.75856983595264
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore
when he lived among women.	291.43692441618447
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	355.7963955318173
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	375.1678462185554
And I heard the voice
of that Egyptian highpriest.	261.4780320535688
_In painted chambers loaded with
tilebooks._
	602.2796270694063
They are still.	101.78634049032519
Once quick in the brains of men.	115.13777283972178
Still: but an itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will.	233.60326984724495
—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic.	278.55450148980856
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	171.50893167143366
Not even so
much.	152.11592127642834
Others abide our question.	424.23490731917843
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	203.722103282205
—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?	259.2592872999969
Mr Best pleaded.	665.426577163406
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
defiance.	270.82663436498063
His private papers in the original.	160.31108130413605
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	439.12709099270586
Taim in mo shagart_.	357.0498044795921
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	356.64060318964204
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
	730.7949289280941
—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	349.4655403872365
Bear with me.	49.49863361224704
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows.	847.2216099842116
A basilisk.	365.4416887200119
_E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_.	1942.2542632562502
Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	339.6020391024456
—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
artist weave and unweave his image.	367.2455988489704
And as the mole on my right breast
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
the image of the unliving son looks forth.	234.43318432306387
In the intense instant of
imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which
I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to
be.	252.86777258476943
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit
here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	233.28093041868115
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	235.45276512273364
—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	655.6895908365774
I feel Hamlet quite young.	371.30893092043505
The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son.	210.52765442340302
He is in my father.	74.15801337899781
I am in his son.	93.81265826700135
—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	204.45038552766593
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	534.2810082737557
—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
in the market.	175.47139032311995
The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit.	511.2702000689337
—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	366.8437718113158
—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.	267.0402670644939
Said that.	29.63054047888148
—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	242.27844449303464
What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre?	455.75059923295066
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	1753.6887782643464
—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	224.9948183902356
—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected.	560.9454786267094
The highroads are dreary but they
lead to the town.	303.36409853164065
Good Bacon: gone musty.	709.1152749738561
Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats.	393.42370027037214
Seekers on the great quest.	125.7761499069437
What town, good
masters?	344.5869364527824
Mummed in names: A.	227.40021615682892
E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.	1272.2477051094509
East of the
sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_.	299.56022453381473
Booted the twain and staved.	207.66055160551053
How many miles to Dublin?	313.0926620807154
Three score and ten, sir.	210.94823056688298
Will we be there by candlelight?	186.1235583489232
—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period.	269.6528629942841
—Does he?	25.706179759234487
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it?	415.5637542291037
—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost.	248.97848877138512
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s
child.	154.028018026931
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	356.7944185094373
—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	537.7520307824968
_L’art d’être
grand_...	775.3310807045233
—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
another image?	183.75709765631552
Do you know what you are talking about?	125.42166082565932
Love, yes.	60.45787357664621
Word known to all
men.	128.19046020569724
_Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
..._
	2577.9775280211493
—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
all experience, material and moral.	225.34189048249635
Such an appeal will touch him.	244.13094683483695
The
images of other males of his blood will repel him.	253.57923837697592
He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.	288.7680171969008
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	503.0240361155042
—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public.	245.7030930139056
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
George Bernard Shaw.	907.8309407256942
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	666.8031874666407
His articles
on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	429.1653959546694
Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
the sonnets.	223.29704753975898
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	782.8799961579638
I
own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more
in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
been.	281.0288897040382
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,
prize of their fray.	336.0206424968979
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	454.9143285919976
Dost love, Miriam?	261.1147925593551
Dost
love thy man?	194.3722659382398
—That may be too, Stephen said.	207.99805545312864
There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr
Magee likes to quote.	286.98052865902
Why does he send to one who is a
_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	236.55321887834882
He was himself a lord
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had
written _Romeo and Juliet_.	193.2414264032421
Belief in himself has been untimely
killed.	304.5854611940401
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)
and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play
victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	276.87206389794983
Assumed dongiovannism will
not save him.	306.10923617697387
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	488.0088415515019
The tusk of
the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	421.5962371385694
If the shrew
is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.	314.1704390942721
There is,
I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
understanding of himself.	242.74927351627457
A like fate awaits him and the two rages
commingle in a whirlpool.	299.1882394277415
They list.	170.63440658944882
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	228.92046002217012
—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear.	330.07251424680044
But those who are done to death in sleep
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	261.32900972651424
The poisoning and the
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	286.86547658622095
That is why the
speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,
backward.	429.18958928630985
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,
with its mole cinquespotted.	353.8310032795866
He goes back, weary of the creation he has
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	278.0197187951946
But,
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
has revealed.	324.7095824321971
His beaver is up.	167.68321828776035
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind
by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
consubstantial with the father.	143.94766300351543
—Amen! was responded from the doorway.	145.1372147768969
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	558.8265627104034
_Entr’acte_.	464.672675952932
My telegram.	216.98246382346196
—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	371.6581412591505
he
asked of Stephen.	140.28951380059115
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a
bauble.	279.140317292432
They make him welcome.	180.31338900570495
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._
	1859.1995982567582
Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	982.4292416606031
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,
Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,
stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on
crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and
dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	572.6635412266852
He lifts his hands.	158.05973555982868
Veils fall.	127.20994979524602
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells
aquiring.	514.6548475575449
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	203.3517442752387
A most instructive discussion.	484.75037705202016
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
Shakespeare.	240.06411864003647
All sides of life should be represented.	267.2486057991468
He smiled on all sides equally.	266.3374292604036
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
	603.4251453974568
I seem to know the name.	115.04789738832184
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	565.9257726751919
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	251.87600653713648
The chap that writes like
Synge.	317.9535837249179
Mr Best turned to him.	151.12509306775678
—Haines missed you, he said.	113.30750260862854
Did you meet him?	102.19374967307144
He’ll see you after at
the D.	135.73778795438818
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	238.58420931671105
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	295.9048946517764
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.	586.0882240989913
I hear that an actress
played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	332.36190720511325
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	102.8743537478294
Has no-one made him out to be
an Irishman?	144.5915101576707
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	539.2013435027642
He
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.	895.3364052525399
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook.	338.1633926335157
That _Portrait of Mr W.	401.1117748377571
H._ where he
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all
hues.	231.93318838461698
—For Willie Hughes, is it not?	216.65774785684454
the quaker librarian asked.	297.80255853926764
Or Hughie Wills?	494.0867752080217
Mr William Himself.	494.0867752080217
H.: who am I?	246.2044497123449
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	733.6414836271858
Of
course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out.	206.25507129686517
It’s the very
essence of Wilde, don’t you know.	158.79533102816677
The light touch.	204.62009520282376
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	412.54077686921994
Tame essence of Wilde.	290.3662259614999
You’re darned witty.	630.9957460041785
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
Deasy’s ducats.	542.4561746627836
How much did I spend?	436.36939449706415
O, a few shillings.	121.58878868852472
For a plump of pressmen.	173.3511089049278
Humour wet and dry.	175.91591733730468
You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks
in.	343.99503425783263
Lineaments of gratified desire.	287.266506493127
There be many mo.	268.0628836148137
Take her for me.	59.100222397050494
In pairing time.	292.2746122175334
Jove, a cool
ruttime send them.	318.99099477341065
Yea, turtledove her.	263.7130230438099
Naked wheatbellied sin.	677.740958790695
A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.	387.572039207145
—Do you think it is only a paradox?	140.06034293682842
the quaker librarian was asking.	289.2533551003964
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	367.36792708815835
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.	531.5570879596929
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	547.8983222002253
Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	243.86882195073474
His
mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	500.11257256026084
—Telegram! he said.	39.595082423913524
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
	1267.0518067862747
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
	375.0528354127285
—_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus.	371.82930296604
Where did you
launch it from?	148.41044143760243
The kips?	365.4416887200119
College Green.	203.15938669399281
Have you drunk the four
quid?	177.04060339557185
The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father.	234.88355309677723
Telegram!
Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	1021.7930696948354
O, you peerless mummer!
O, you priestified Kinchite!
	743.4945534998994
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
querulous brogue:
	325.53980712213803
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	235.3348561326428
’Twas murmur we did
for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with
leching.	437.9098543031042
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s
sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	343.6314818996073
He wailed:
	464.672675952932
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	272.52358802743237
Stephen laughed.	130.51080469431187
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	886.7461359615249
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	201.56506693200552
He heard
you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	250.79991574246304
That was your contribution to literature.	217.61773286612757
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
ceiling.	513.7203001347787
—Murder you! he laughed.	85.11062088987576
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of
lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts.	628.4029897776159
In words of words for words,
palabras.	225.7587102262318
Oisin with Patrick.	139.89404219474883
Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
brandishing a winebottle.	431.15810028420964
_C’est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish.	771.9588592493714
His
image, wandering, he met.	292.80530594947055
I mine.	119.73877783559664
I met a fool i’the forest.	146.71591284980886
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	254.67645810461224
in which everyone can find his own.	213.82258064844765
So Mr Justice Madden in his
_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	525.7047203503591
What is it?	44.73630436839303
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
offering a card.	186.87300554606273
From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
_Kilkenny People_ for last year.	219.99428934635966
—Certainly, certainly, certainly.	287.4824040173234
Is the gentleman?...	53.60933863805958
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
asked, creaked, asked:
	491.48877417196275
—Is he?...	25.706179759234487
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	103.83865220921791
In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
honest broadbrim.	610.3381712319227
—This gentleman?	96.93434633056324
_Freeman’s Journal?	136.70385447397808
Kilkenny People?_ To be sure.	290.4787724194884
Good
day, sir.	118.5317445733037
We have certainly...	143.94132587253006
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	1043.9744736725129
—All the leading provincial...	212.42981489497166
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,
Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903...	930.053226462034
Will you please?...	99.046562131297
Evans, conduct this
gentleman...	323.23560534637073
If you just follow the atten...	203.09967346253742
Or, please allow me...	261.8338174086898
This way...	66.03698384662606
Please, sir...	71.8721773002824
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
dark figure following his hasty heels.	315.3778163853177
The door closed.	214.63498716237714
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	910.4035099677219
He jumped up and snatched the card.	210.71954112013051
—What’s his name?	62.555919736771
Ikey Moses?	203.15938669399281
He rattled on:
	167.43270171588193
I found him over in the
museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	273.9294286990343
The Greek mouth
that has never been twisted in prayer.	318.8505837558711
Every day we must do homage to
her.	174.45545833679589
_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._
	235.37999182374676
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
	127.78855945379229
—He knows you.	94.57465974577792
He knows your old fellow.	185.99729805532493
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	558.95664313525
Venus Kallipyge.	203.15938669399281
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the
maiden hid_.	435.5046947727277
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.	548.4440834275462
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	346.3485943990705
Till now we had thought of her, if
at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	226.54499299738836
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	433.5058863374329
Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a
salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	194.36190423055052
His life was
rich.	148.75099254036488
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called
it, is the art of surfeit.	268.81806977033585
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,
honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,
ringocandies.	1326.4592677803867
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a
million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	343.52431631510126
The
gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of
Sheba.	519.3590678857056
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its
chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	463.54837164190525
You know
Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her
bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s
blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	371.21422130552446
And the gay
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	369.2187703074779
Cours la Reine.	361.6579361932423
_Encore vingt sous.	1247.7144807542668

Tu veux?_
	238.19223555623844
—The height of fine society.	273.57197414055577
And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s
mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	321.03534024833266
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
	510.87880457153796
—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
	770.5244035147354
—And Harry of six wives’ daughter.	370.0364762143298
And other lady friends from
neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	679.6855081224811
But all those
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
behind the diamond panes?	312.2562070233588
Do and do.	46.129000513659726
Thing done.	101.736722320319
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn.	455.3371611263108
An azured harebell like her veins.	660.8146551001861
Lids of
Juno’s eyes, violets.	200.41958137639202
One life is all.	86.44096204807228
One body.	104.53177758218244
But do.	55.71292897014647
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	261.27215525169186
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.	1038.9198363011221
—Whom do you suspect?	166.9324454526506
he challenged.	256.4631792874164
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	125.91732343914052
Once spurned twice
spurned.	670.0740793901768
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	238.05543080751306
Love that dare not speak its name.	218.2822415270782
—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord.	345.4258774005752
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	676.7776709595463
At Charenton I watched them.	497.7787099862608
—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
the stallion.	255.47533075113046
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he
had a shrew to wife.	156.3978060498847
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a
bedvow.	322.351785474846
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the
dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s
brother.	400.0497576771443
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	207.43959392896048
Once a wooer,
twice a wooer.	279.00097804644946
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	200.25509258758638
—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	160.84867814857347
If you
deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	206.46721202358884
All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use
granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	331.18374114965417
O, yes, mention there is.	163.46119484682885
In the years when he was living richly in
royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
father’s shepherd.	267.28910598878633
Explain you then.	58.468870572071
Explain the swansong too wherein
he has commended her to posterity.	316.2780468546084
He faced their silence.	357.5670376273935
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	443.35302233028125
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.	406.33771009496695
She was entitled to her widow’s dower
At common law.	393.45822120010956
His legal knowledge was great
Our judges tell us.	588.0536006066461
Him Satan fleers,
Mocker:
	1165.3198457737649
And therefore he left out her name
From the first draft but he did not leave out
The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
And in London.	330.0927648943263
And therefore when he was urged,
As I believe, to name her
He left her his
Secondbest
Bed.	383.54161181725107

—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	535.5793029228382
—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and
landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	331.2839069286765
Why did he not leave her
his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
peace?	189.64232057885664
—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
Secondbest Best said finely.	331.70452385784336
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
smiled on.	429.5206011476924
—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	2284.3348512712614
Let me think.	96.612457675461
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget
Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	418.1114538317277
—Do you mean he died so?	133.55272884345322
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	468.2757940559971
I mean...	105.0118366222856
—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	963.367063214891
A quart of ale is a dish for
a king.	190.7314611567664
O, I must tell you what Dowden said!

For

Dowden, Highfield house...	261.36510828262624
—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	1753.7330654938205
I asked him what he thought
of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	176.89121558550906
He lifted his
hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those
days._ Lovely!
	233.70130639368102
—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
ugling Eglinton.	672.248438920874
Steadfast John replied severe:
	793.3349089264614
—The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	287.9593242905739
You cannot eat your cake
and have it.	225.14035790866302
Sayest thou so?	134.18217086906617
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	175.9892114855676
—And the sense of property, Stephen said.	183.74684735487182
He drew Shylock out of his
own long pocket.	210.12816021495706
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
famine riots.	318.51410428294076
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	601.538656148427
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	293.50981237180457
How else could
Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	477.9793160318601
All events brought grist to
his mill.	403.71464185303466
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being
plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_
with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn
for witchroasting.	288.1824464406984
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love’s Labour Lost_.	423.5379478560419
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
enthusiasm.	604.7838183990438
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s
theory of equivocation.	282.89889722251064
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and

cousin.	567.9466631959956
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s.	805.0541125373791
As for fay Elizabeth,
otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives
of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for
deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	650.3795039598549

_Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._
	949.3688445485956
—Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	345.2516618490441

of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	271.8305544273115
_Sufflaminandus sum._
	136.87205862777765
—He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
polisher of Italian scandals.	539.2157283967451
Coleridge called him
myriadminded.	264.606391731901
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit

	2375.64961235017
—Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	591.5712946419702
—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	906.4397408241837
There he keened a wailing rune.	401.10287123861616
—_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It’s destroyed we are from this day!
It’s destroyed we are surely!
	529.5557580014033
All smiled their smiles.	270.52195051886684
—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in
his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	377.23090726132693
He means that
the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	255.68987623786018
Jews, whom christians tax with
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	359.19319014540736
Accusations
are made in anger.	173.28726139920096
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
affections too with hoops of steel.	334.4044881931211
Whether these be sins or virtues
old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	528.2982251810313
But a man who holds so
tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will
hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
his wife.	239.60937777576498
—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	985.8309311981109
—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.	766.8075119851696
—Which will?	60.46787389028839
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	788.0916398423384
We are getting mixed.	256.57484690961417
—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s
widow, is the will to die.	356.25399277393313
_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.	433.1194216738768
What of all the will to do?	55.6862179603927
It has vanished long ago...	335.19763488548176
—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of
seven parishes.	282.81294816432194
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed
with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid
for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a
soul.	264.04507889640644
Venus has
twisted her lips in prayer.	245.32556181169218
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	288.42177439425217
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	332.5922406582301
—History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.	434.6247949301592
The
ages succeed one another.	462.899220951103
But we have it on high authority that a man’s
worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	193.0571539567721
I feel that
Russell is right.	192.8936455905229
What do we care for his wife or father?	153.06186919232405
I should say
that only family poets have family lives.	375.665301190319
Falstaff was not a family
man.	102.56086834305418
I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.	260.61393371028083
Lean, he lay back.	107.23788019019611
Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid.	846.9111542720094
Shy, supping
with the godless, he sneaks the cup.	276.1494250797249
A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it
him.	407.28907733558526
Visits him here on quarter days.	181.6356779205064
Mr Magee, sir, there’s a
gentleman to see you.	131.54656917395522
Says he’s your father, sir.	97.0413869564072
Give me my
Wordsworth.	167.39202164424003
Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in
strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with
clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.	625.7688117288487
Your own?	81.26234677727427
He knows your old fellow.	185.99729805532493
The widower.	216.97884341188544
Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I
touched his hand.	371.569184521195
The voice, new warmth, speaking.	406.71867438857413
Dr Bob Kenny is
attending her.	423.01445641792685
The eyes that wish me well.	152.33359949740037
But do not know me.	107.68851363470228
—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
evil.	480.4469061200164
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.	144.52984155162895
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,
with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,
with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the
lustful queen.	457.10376540521395
The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
night.	281.04528340017777
From hour to hour it rots and rots.	274.64942501816404
He rests, disarmed of
fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.	643.996021219034
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child.	162.0801096059089
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to
man.	191.71550783356952
It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only
begetter to only begotten.	485.7141279687254
On that mystery and not on the madonna which
the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is
founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro
and microcosm, upon the void.	314.5852549729741
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.	692.5902229064504
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true
thing in life.	386.87734677430154
Paternity may be a legal fiction.	265.90764052552794
Who is the father of
any son that any son should love him or he any son?	154.09887805687367
What the hell are you driving at?	140.80176246812894
I know.	62.35918204518505
Shut up.	45.161717238889764
Blast you.	32.76073075102579
I have reasons.	196.44983656458277

Are you condemned to do this?	144.37390419527827
—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
hardly record its breach.	413.19920933756447
Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.	740.6698234701678
The son
unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
care.	1089.9926332913126
He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth
his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.	205.27806552145967
In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.	806.8911231436239
—What links them in nature?	189.3736872160528
An instant of blind rut.	279.89172543988974
Am I a father?	142.30102909907336

Shrunken uncertain hand.	273.3835443943828
—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son.	335.07704125414233
The bulldog of
Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him.	417.8079104292329
Well: if the
father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
father be a son?	124.98091102216733
When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another
poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not
the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and
felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own
grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,
never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors
perfection.	218.78702748450146
Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.	345.63320515977875
Gladly

Pallas Athena! A play! The

	534.7257571223632
He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.	464.15807326281316
—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest
of Arden.	188.6729115885899
Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
_Coriolanus._ His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare.	351.7560979325719

guess.	468.11315373988435
—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.	900.9844680466576

STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard.	764.5084027039974

playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul.	801.5104756074403
He is nowhere: but an Edmund
and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.	246.20838605040987
MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?	166.57021045970356
BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know.	234.76544890727516
I hope you are going to
say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.	183.189618386482
_(Laughter)_
	137.22421879471196
BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)
	857.7157624187907
Then outspoke medical Dick
	1022.4643328689946
To his comrade medical Davy...	414.26410735544323
STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’
names.	739.5718335461289
Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.	349.00720701231137
BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it.	281.5784694226515
I don’t want Richard, my name
...	238.79571837040422
_(Laughter)_
	137.22421879471196
QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...	374.7484701168587
STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.	247.18392263392886
He has revealed it
in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus.	233.31756780067818
What’s in
a name?	52.9592598852448
That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the
name that we are told is ours.	233.55430798268563
A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at
his birth.	304.83217783465585
It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in
the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the
recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the
stars.	268.7459520297037
His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the
bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight
returning from Shottery and from her arms.	285.7921783081703
Both satisfied.	226.02305965594886
I too.	56.16717052284047
Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.	183.60499680185882
And from her arms.	97.63705196354775
Wait to be wooed and won.	139.56557797765242
Ay, meacock.	464.672675952932
Who will woo you?	186.3421293901916
Read the skies.	104.80482517530956
Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where’s your
configuration?	346.99604639463615
Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even.	272.2586404985949
D: _sua donna.	1142.2921202053549
Già: di lui.	662.8982577969518
D._
	29.735702233990914
—What is that, Mr Dedalus?	235.49640503299156
the quaker librarian asked.	297.80255853926764
Was it a
celestial phenomenon?	183.85030641710873
—A star by night, Stephen said.	261.8090551308649
A pillar of the cloud by day.	137.3857032997688
Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.	148.213208441998
_Stephanos,_ my crown.	113.35825178167644
My sword.	236.72887101340675
His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet.	217.07389052373486
Buy a pair.	74.87385035670377
Holes in my socks.	116.32314684774357
Handkerchief too.	56.16717052284047
—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.	306.61839580466483
Your own name is
strange enough.	254.75617850281313
I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.	512.2784213490992
Me, Magee and Mulligan.	249.5976425755857
Fabulous artificer.	464.672675952932
The hawklike man.	363.2524086395394
You flew.	196.37578826838856
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger.	1444.664035904669
Paris and back.	48.555976130669166
Lapwing you are.	57.31904088463169
Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
	363.611471143773
—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know,
we find also in the old Irish myths.	297.8405144838051
Just what you say.	80.64786503147451
The three
brothers Shakespeare.	427.83983298602584
In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales.	215.1696852799391
The
third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
prize.	334.75808563601106
Best of Best brothers.	223.75352730887124
Good, better, best.	155.89313362750522
The quaker librarian springhalted near.	731.1422087786318
—I should like to know, he said, which brother you...	124.66002070596659
I understand you
to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers...	165.33153729236858
But perhaps
I am anticipating?	598.1881658311411
He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.	209.3735010813216
An attendant from the doorway called:
	200.09862914229487
—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...	823.7348079667242
—O, Father Dineen! Directly.	770.5244035147354
Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.	678.1682643696969
John Eglinton touched the foil.	383.93799405233983
—Come, he said.	39.595082423913524
Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.	161.63250104568104
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?	138.33927486115115
—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.	677.2898008967798
A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.	269.5827823126212
Where is your brother?	123.34040084691479
Apothecaries’ hall.	127.2014629412334
My whetstone.	365.4355909322164
Him, then
Cranly, Mulligan: now these.	381.39284348155314
Speech, speech.	141.33088670420966
But act.	128.2810818213596
Act speech.	141.33088670420966
They
mock to try you.	178.32363200141833
Be acted on.	196.48658234233062
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.	160.72113058700577
My kingdom for a drink.	156.47833634807913
—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
took the stuff of his plays.	196.11653257125602
Why did he take them rather than others?	210.6950823752263
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	379.00762442335866
Richard
the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	382.12827457845816
The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	294.02910109039686
Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,
the angel of the world.	234.64100607358807
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to
a Celtic legend older than history?	377.1709483989461
—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.	512.3825009204492
We should not now combine
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.	468.90063461137663
_Que
voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.	541.6353109940239
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	555.9013111430105
Stephen answered himself.	162.22567669478624
Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	152.62269577412593
The note of
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
book.	553.7176117463764
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	537.523430637614
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	296.80699693901676
But it
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	225.60021329301816
The words are those of my
lords bishops of Maynooth.	266.8680531772339
An original sin and, like original sin,
committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	363.04944943657284
It is between the
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
which her four bones are not to be laid.	212.04519714290396
Age has not withered it.	182.1997040567657
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	152.5751395060273
It is in infinite variety
everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,
twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure
for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.	298.10762899871503
He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.	193.72033165356646
Judge Eglinton summed up.	549.2921419750309
—The truth is midway, he affirmed.	337.91231322634394
He is the ghost and the prince.	79.47732747735664
He
is all in all.	56.955215832397535
—He is, Stephen said.	145.23563099035937
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	184.86208768024716
All in all.	39.012043616111974
In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	219.46467389935606
He
acts and is acted on.	202.31790763589336
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he
kills the real Carmen.	284.5303010940224
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	574.6021390588871
—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	1827.0757013198781
O word of fear!
	128.51808006526855
Dark dome received, reverbed.	974.5593852837575
—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	651.0905477178535
When
all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.	301.8032940938219
After God
Shakespeare has created most.	594.782723780847
—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	377.1621369222095
He returns after
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	205.87383263260037
Then dies.	236.72887101340675
The
motion is ended.	327.08255818941075
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A
king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	456.4099330396796
And, what
though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
they refuse to be divorced.	369.0561851468973
If you like the epilogue look long on it:
prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of
love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
place where the bad niggers go.	326.50824296947695
Strong curtain.	236.72492112764175
He found in the world
without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	169.11959017733224
Maeterlinck
says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
on his doorstep.	327.94278692926457
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day.	350.81730667508066
We walk through
ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.	724.1341582280511
_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried.	503.4926905049253
_Eureka!_
	29.735702233990914
Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s
desk.	385.06685734062114
—May I?	203.15938669399281
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	383.8237079956699
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	188.83780058224144
Take some slips from the counter going out.	198.32950109754216
—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
shall live.	500.37463954060127
The rest shall keep as they are.	209.3852175932908
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	491.2858942622883
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._
	539.8029867649461
—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	461.0038436025975
You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	254.7644502057151
Do you believe
your own theory?	242.24923096507817
—No, Stephen said promptly.	338.4805836452752
—Are you going to write it?	94.96646039330997
Mr Best asked.	255.87999104604643
You ought to make it a
dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	286.7570518013712
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	713.4506216513792
—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment
for it since you don’t believe it yourself.	230.81466180193695
Dowden believes there is
some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	269.3217696972697
Herr Bleibtreu, the man
Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	355.22550844435614
He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
wrote the plays.	233.93677607572351
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	140.96454231103067
But he
believes his theory.	204.10779150166385
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	705.4746231605546
That is, help me to believe or
help me to unbelieve?	201.5308426065494
Who helps to believe?	250.0577349555149
_Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?	227.30134950328858
Other chap.	113.07104031998887
—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	276.4757730301191
Then I don’t know about the next number.	216.61814832489452
Fred Ryan wants space for an
article on economics.	449.87048379839723
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	209.51093813843156
Tide you over.	62.23806272936599
—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	364.2102049110423
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:
	419.82302040161875
—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa
contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly
and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	349.8694493598715
He broke away.	203.51775852524847
—Come, Kinch.	203.15938669399281
Come, Kinch.	203.15938669399281
You have eaten all we left.	188.29709225791947
I will serve you your orts
and offals.	357.33660984286735
Stephen rose.	108.19094078438673
Life is many days.	160.05585546310158
This will end.	138.85420856311217
—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	363.0752886059121
_Notre ami_ Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there.	583.0077994232345
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	501.21802587499553
—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
Ireland.	259.9056531742328
I’ll be there.	100.24078172225529
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	315.1808444589154
Can you walk
straight?	188.07356353453244
Laughing, he...	25.706179759234487
Swill till eleven.	205.76283029646441
Irish nights entertainment.	589.049212924163
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	160.334309478581
His
lub back: I followed.	626.7815234051816
I gall his kibe.	433.7393624693513
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a
wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering
daylight of no thought.	437.08457304650716
What have I learned?	354.1390546381269
Of them?	48.58276040143106
Of me?	43.12221257392657
Walk like Haines now.	195.712712550257
The constant readers’ room.	644.1739540318891
In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor
Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables.	1146.0324930755644
Item: was Hamlet
mad?	273.2742662413215
The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	441.73920565183374
—O please do, sir...	184.85358136825226
I shall be most pleased...	271.7008198039934
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:
	655.9072852114025
—A pleased bottom.	368.34120167897987
The turnstile.	365.4416887200119
Is that?...	29.63054047888148
Blueribboned hat...	78.81905874603555
Idly writing...	146.402893804774
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	1758.6338042261639
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
	1086.356431073612
John Eglinton, my jo, John,
	690.4860168028038
Why won’t you wed a wife?	182.31390310524762
He spluttered to the air:
	133.4174983298197
—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	978.4084555883918
We went over to their
playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall.	344.4942169891299
Our players are creating a
new art for Europe like the Greeks or M.	371.4972766484173
Abbey Theatre! I
smell the pubic sweat of monks.	518.1665174015834
He spat blank.	556.5591730067385
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	337.1575883192366
And
left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born?	494.5117933853131
And his
first child a girl?	123.37236394261981
Go back.	60.304329750857036
The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.	467.51497605245544
I just eh...	166.10966451473888
I forgot...	156.74763020725334
—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there...	319.4539216177634
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
	1881.3862297954404
I hardly hear the purlieu cry
	390.8013738874573
Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
	275.5409577961272
Before my thoughts begin to run
	254.2474834469167
On F.	203.15938669399281
M’Curdy Atkinson,
	494.0867752080217
The same that had the wooden leg
	170.5404083467859
And that filibustering filibeg
	473.8068879447853
That never dared to slake his drouth,
	368.8291843105486
Magee that had the chinless mouth.	132.02874343125222
Being afraid to marry on earth
	223.30189471917308
They masturbated for all they were worth.	245.32828467617702
Jest on.	32.610077424956444
Know thyself.	365.4416887200119
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	243.80088217351192
I halt.	236.72887101340675
—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	1560.0178732103632
Synge has left off wearing
black to be like nature.	213.19614952229216
Only crows, priests and English coal are
black.	525.3574224728084
A laugh tripped over his lips.	295.78200504522715
—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
old hake Gregory.	264.0456505830244
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a
job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	303.11962412227246
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?	156.0136806351801
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
	401.9481778064819
—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	179.19651268071777
One thinks of Homer.	208.5536474281451
He stopped at the stairfoot.	174.69218993253628
—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.	208.6026232255346
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	1510.0111131963456
Gone the nine men’s
morrice with caps of indices.	257.4688952061857
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:
	900.1007988615381
_Everyman His Own Wife
or
A Honeymoon in the Hand
(a national immorality in three orgasms)
by
Ballocky Mulligan._
	511.56886496445736
He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:
	363.40208003266844
—The disguise, I fear, is thin.	758.6820751639611
But listen.	148.25984336927286
He read, _marcato:_
	257.1904747781831

FRESH NELLY
	203.15938669399281
ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	223.51006868830677
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
	258.28041090486863
—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
	277.7705882380601
—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
them.	336.3867225524465
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	216.02849994239085
The moment is now.	119.99837457207366
Where then?	51.270025270301566
That lies in space which I in time must
come to, ineluctably.	267.7208573390876
My will: his will that fronts me.	160.1077411987824
Seas between.	85.32214281439043
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	348.1112485913253
—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	337.1090495422424
The portico.	464.672675952932
Here I watched the birds for augury.	374.8287885479849
Ængus of the birds.	58.93893660225717
They go, they
come.	116.56087033582372
Last night I flew.	444.5046931452938
Easily flew.	196.37578826838856
Men wondered.	249.72410360095353
Street of harlots
after.	141.31255559844516
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	288.3896949349635
You will see.	93.52482953255574
—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe.	717.3821965499285
Did you
see his eye?	90.81711194373638
He looked upon you to lust after you.	169.54411240713753
I fear thee, ancient
mariner.	616.4365589234219
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	413.5563273502763
Get thee a breechpad.	261.8294948916847
Manner of Oxenford.	106.7296495237354
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	235.5256402411237
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
under portcullis barbs.	319.83206499362035
They followed.	116.60669096770116
Offend me still.	90.18923155746923
Speak on.	32.610077424956444
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	326.7973041755317
No birds.	170.63440658944882
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in
a flaw of softness softly were blown.	364.9384563939927
Cease to strive.	174.08116674064578
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:
from wide earth an altar.	391.83912351201354
Laud we the gods
	96.672074133743
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
	425.742278271532
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	555.0508352171064
reset his smooth
watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	240.9908919613346
Five
to three.	62.876838241113646
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	190.10384549688357
What was that boy’s name
again?	117.63679985749731
_Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the
person to see.	449.56854033797583
Mr Cunningham’s letter.	206.79886543350855
Oblige him, if possible.	128.4646608566811
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	640.385011425026
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
crutches, growled some notes.	720.6320375867712
He jerked short before the convent of the
sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
reverend John Conmee S.	370.7863648636298
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	229.63346448687844
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	460.05816627055276
He thought, but not for long,
of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P.	399.2298875384587
—Very well, indeed, father.	204.1864626144298
And you, father?	68.19267098682151
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	428.5515896659381
He would go to Buxton
probably for the waters.	186.99257170643256
And her boys, were they getting on well at
Belvedere?	213.9981429978695
Was that so?	53.64936247183686
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
that.	236.01097942042378
Still in London.	119.91274847764197
The house was still
sitting, to be sure it was.	133.36406485665063
Beautiful weather it was, delightful
indeed.	289.71498513304743
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would
come again to preach.	362.5155120828508
O, yes: a very great success.	192.32450738200376
A wonderful man
really.	273.57478028090026
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.	386.3880826692783
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.	359.8925340663541
—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	728.8599008387894
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	287.406183354924
And smiled yet again,
in going.	196.8866828639463
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	354.58384212582035
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.	393.79930555362176
—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?	319.20213688687426
A zealous man, however.	418.86373842501234
Really he was.	35.441684332301406
And really did great good in his
way.	153.7131852907586
Beyond a doubt.	99.4460311525303
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	176.9935234776935
Of good family too would one think it?	182.98050199208166
Welsh, were they not?	82.79226835209253
O, lest he forget.	244.71821644046574
That letter to father provincial.	202.5149014837484
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square.	333.8501058516919
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	161.44811063636666
The little house.	121.85664039975491
And were
they good boys at school?	198.52778133825979
That was very good now.	116.8661178660302
And what was his
name?	75.01536845719357
And his name?	63.12677714278271
His name was Brunny Lynam.	319.17714681596493
O, that was a very nice name to have.	101.00265317131148
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	265.2579521606882
—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	200.47215303586478
—O, sir.	71.8721773002824
—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	256.17609975377746
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	315.1484440928939
Father
Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
east.	407.32678872633835
Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?	379.180894900081
Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
farther footpath along which she sailed.	719.9228451688251
And Father Conmee smiled and
saluted.	446.20148586979076
How did she do?	95.35563132365075
A fine carriage she had.	188.03129265359732
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	339.7854369760596
And to
think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	182.6555464845278
what should he
say?...	109.39820395037482
such a queenly mien.	303.78078043765566
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
shutup free church on his left.	344.06106527956604
The reverend T.	374.7710128874529
Greene B.A.	494.0867752080217
will
(D.V.) speak.	580.0574574644604
The incumbent they called him.	250.0211930603625
He felt it incumbent on
him to say a few words.	167.76446688941343
But one should be charitable.	243.2484875217841
Invincible
ignorance.	287.39671252413314
They acted according to their lights.	373.7496616570466
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
road.	292.18604238524955
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
important thoroughfare.	175.36789681650086
Surely, there ought to be.	95.39299135435762
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	521.4413372314752
All
raised untidy caps.	707.2316924959429
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	531.6628087591946
Christian brother boys.	235.71493977951212
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	262.43387572519305
Saint
Joseph’s church, Portland row.	449.2017623209169
For aged and virtuous females.	416.17892559635925
Father
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	268.65113653567965
Virtuous: but
occasionally they were also badtempered.	350.58868864386017
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
nobleman.	561.3816810248167
And now it was an office or something.	134.6588420381127
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	315.59607331396995
Father
Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	533.7066175431752
He passed Grogan’s the
Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
catastrophe in New York.	365.3262069612035
In America those things were continually
happening.	613.7840484681803
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	222.0744794887889
Still, an
act of perfect contrition.	291.76104450989516
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged.	421.91388878795686
They saluted him and were saluted.	183.99124137284122
Father Conmee passed H.	527.4287947015703
O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny
Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	500.88523221299187
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
the constable.	524.0925267213823
In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
tubes.	466.210352742158
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
him.	393.5823259439174
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out
and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
people.	263.5510295252064
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	566.9770370494282
of saint Francis
Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
tram.	554.1457776192946
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	687.0921070670773
of
saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	393.08426979407164
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	592.2667185181787
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
his purse.	346.9626995148339
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket
inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away
the ticket.	367.8983666863601
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father
Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	290.15442180949714
Father Conmee liked
cheerful decorum.	1089.0281557575815
It was a peaceful day.	131.93080873154403
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	370.7370604749685
His wife, Father Conmee
supposed.	697.1659547885239
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
with the glasses.	137.2755677027089
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so
gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and
smiled tinily, sweetly.	666.4792727840472
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	231.36237470119627
He perceived also that
the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
seat.	139.90306710157114
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	196.97967001917536
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	222.81741870375762
The conductor pulled the
bellstrap to stay the car for her.	235.6710727990486
She passed out with her basket and a
marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
cares, poor creatures.	282.46573382807736
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
Father Conmee.	871.3660032037492
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men
and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	241.36788089911963
and the African mission
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and
brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when
their last hour came like a thief in the night.	162.53635401359455
That book by the
Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a
reasonable plea.	672.1571120080619
Those were millions of human souls created by God in
His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.	453.3351447956967
But
they were God’s souls, created by God.	345.5803536597255
It seemed to Father Conmee a
pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	251.0906624187451
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
conductor and saluted in his turn.	349.955089645036
The Malahide road was quiet.	326.06348106905955
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	440.32747018787717
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	552.7207571193418
Lord Talbot de Malahide,
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	615.8460398498545
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	147.07832714518221
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old
times in the barony.	436.99036354204105
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and
of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
Belvedere.	300.5243871087814
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
not startled when an otter plunged.	530.9045452108242
Who could know the truth?	121.61796705181283
Not the
jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
her husband’s brother?	534.9224504967763
She would half confess if she had not all sinned
as women did.	249.409718092232
Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.	139.96076651364035
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our
ways.	272.20983254182335
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	319.40935421839
He was humane and
honoured there.	207.61908893007507
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
clusters.	490.4157352279119
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	271.4123168270508
It was a charming day.	115.90745609501924
The sky showed him a flock of
small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	301.3628157279712
_Moutonner,_ the French
said.	88.97209869692331
A just and homely word.	200.02115708659548
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
over Rathcoffey.	499.57070470623245
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
Clongowes field.	482.615620538592
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
evening.	185.8762210052823
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	276.5715507211865
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	306.6412058029998
He should have read that before lunch.	240.28824572310623
But lady Maxwell had
come.	268.0789813108184
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	316.5756432717965
_Deus in adiutorium._
	134.99321263205402
He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._
	787.6931922100888
A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	223.25153457947306
The young man raised
his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	364.9627403161399
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary.	332.1797224653743
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
formidavit cor meum._
	1388.1271360537512
Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	356.89411136902254
He pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings.	389.69370760692084
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway.	150.58342041497033
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	266.9594632851262
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	553.9594860115387
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	457.79428302421474
Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	162.97377101507914
—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	246.30254998906423
—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	339.27239792854846
—It’s very close, the constable said.	149.2437050091698
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
coin.	402.94267924564605
—What’s the best news?	102.45274109623257
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
bated breath.	341.13566248268825
A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting
Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.	679.1943568927
Towards
Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
	467.3898604517939
—_For England_...	203.15938669399281
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
and growled:
	614.3155928632153
—_home and beauty._
	71.54967238147665
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
into the cap held out to her.	263.1807090403172
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself
forward four strides.	584.4974288817425
He halted and growled angrily:
	341.62918322520284
—_For England_...	203.15938669399281
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
towards a window and bayed deeply:
	436.82942572882473
—_home and beauty._
	71.54967238147665
The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	449.0371752905703
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	168.87119726622075
A card _Unfurnished
Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.	413.3851626618382
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	259.62593625575556
It fell on the path.	122.45242867026911
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrel’s cap, saying:
	186.92157652610553
—There, sir.	71.8721773002824
Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming
kitchen.	224.0006196101671
—Did you put in the books?	90.63178667990533
Boody asked.	75.71580409413632
—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.	161.6846503058598
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
tickled by stubble.	818.0298658393123
—Where did you try?	122.51698601117853
Boody asked.	75.71580409413632
—M’Guinness’s.	136.37444050802486
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	209.76810823882693
—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	223.46435794001894
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	186.80827891210043
—What’s in the pot?	65.97101118652519
she asked.	74.03092045002538
—Shirts, Maggy said.	165.5081573229974
Boody cried angrily:
	330.8133501507295
—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	135.6502885963594
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
	234.90069259044606
—And what’s in this?	62.026443697386725
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	487.91804716786305
—Peasoup, Maggy said.	165.5081573229974
Katey asked.	75.71580409413632
—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	521.8984454213411
The lacquey rang his bell.	389.08058390249613
Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
	152.86560507317049
—Give us it here.	97.71672493465448
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	338.2858190984237
—A good job we have that much.	165.1085678381884
Where’s Dilly?	136.70385447397808
—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	191.13099836653774
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
	376.76266126941215
—Our father who art not in heaven.	172.834179768007
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:
	543.8645666915879
—Boody! For shame!
	445.6969501808581
A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.	623.0451977324042
The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling
fibre.	534.6847850318991
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
and a small jar.	374.3760227114981
—Put these in first, will you?	113.41803371423335
And the fruit on top.	136.92833585557324
—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	465.74893232351735
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
shamefaced peaches.	788.0479874417982
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
tomatoes, sniffing smells.	627.6295441765761
Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
plodding towards their goal.	900.685818753331
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
his fob and held it at its chain’s length.	272.61090035550484
—Can you send them by tram?	190.44487597127602
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s
cart.	630.1748352348201
—Certainly, sir.	71.8721773002824
Is it in the city?	53.91522878687479
—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	321.5656384545453
Ten minutes.	164.52153759044862
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	324.22641874176094
—Will you write the address, sir?	146.96694682805338
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	193.58683583153507
—Send it at once, will you?	98.07726004052728
It’s for an invalid.	143.7574851416982
—Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
I will, sir.	109.91992916267223
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.	401.22276356938045
—What’s the damage?	91.48701800677499
he asked.	66.98244490415372
The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	447.8606793027677
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	203.16552459904617
A young pullet.	370.3058836492985
He
took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	292.05918694218525
—This for me?	52.38820486313549
he asked gallantly.	288.6798402763643
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
a bit crooked, blushing.	383.3353629184994
—Yes, sir, she said.	88.63865629567108
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
red flower between his smiling teeth.	259.2272044103199
—May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	317.5629306026049
_—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.	367.5134104160178
He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.	502.7850306397475
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
gripping the handrests.	613.2106345661301
Men’s arms frankly round their
stunted forms.	422.65543717748244
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	347.24692347191956
—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero
giovine come Lei.	2120.5997332115953
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	3102.2812042134897
È
peccato.	464.672675952932
Perchè la sua voce...	980.4340408107408
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	1803.831240750175
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._
	569.7195299874418
—_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.	551.9429701801146
_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	299.6188826030488
_Ma, dia retta
a me.	352.64694986576916
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	650.2830023307519
—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	472.39380799520234
—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	759.5426240434105
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly.	402.24277507654
Human eyes.	62.2820201442977
They gazed curiously
an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	403.6721113087155
_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	456.10364766142965
_Venga a trovarmi
e ci pensi.	644.1257082328398
Addio, caro._
	184.79456031736208
—_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
was freed.	298.3860674994436
_E grazie._
	238.19223555623844
—_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	393.66693490556605
_Scusi, eh?	118.07692457180981
Tante belle cose!_
	446.7368833111395
Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram.	370.3495291973358
In vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through Trinity gates.	676.1207363867181
Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
typewriter.	423.1277768421788
Too much mystery business in it.	189.16040664519562
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	109.2115118709572
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	287.29742972980404
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
six.	426.59562953764157
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
	362.07083034832857
—16 June 1904.	494.0867752080217
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab
where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	574.0498041171653
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.	223.27733415943175
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens
and capital esses.	559.2439070447688
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	280.9305870478549
She’s not
nicelooking, is she?	134.17764876566824
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.	133.33140208036252
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	162.0880767234515
If I could get that
dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s.	377.67410769824716
They kick out
grand.	256.75795637554705
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	175.26239293864205
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.	235.5209213478899
The telephone rang rudely by her ear.	440.4613224912926
Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
No, sir.	71.8721773002824
Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
I’ll ring them up after five.	217.0148137586556
Only
those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	229.28315048434038
All right, sir.	119.82443275331963
Then I can
go after six if you’re not back.	240.8591437203144
A quarter after.	183.50356885579652
Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
Twentyseven
and six.	70.8063964331454
I’ll tell him.	117.43994347935016
Yes: one, seven, six.	217.64963974020932
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	387.56555024118023
—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	311.7979519410633
Mr Lenehan, yes.	220.23206265744474
He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four.	116.886534384857
No, sir.	71.8721773002824
Yes,
sir.	71.8721773002824
I’ll ring them up after five.	217.0148137586556
Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	260.73159727767717
—Who’s that?	37.77232725523974
Ned Lambert asked.	255.87999104604643
Is that Crotty?	137.15405456813983
—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	348.64993490965975
—Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	196.2109336456311
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
pliant lath among the flickering arches.	535.4854436476521
Come on.	32.610077424956444
Mind your steps
there.	154.9576255058398
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
soft flame and was let fall.	296.6027352534526
—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	228.32105248885375
—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	497.55592516984456
We are standing in the historic
council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
himself a rebel in 1534.	476.567190329747
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	204.62574040636449
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.	228.11802959165718
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their
synagogue over in Adelaide road.	226.68980998974178
You were never here before, Jack, were
you?	213.82858271695233
—No, Ned.	203.15938669399281
—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
serves me.	438.8544807712781
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.	220.61503185308607
—That’s right, Ned Lambert said.	253.88941067425378
That’s quite right, sir.	146.7783622729817
—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
allow me perhaps...	171.54790088416064
—Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	339.27239792854846
Bring the camera whenever you like.	188.35038622176057
I’ll
get those bags cleared away from the windows.	303.06998799562894
You can take it from here
or from here.	140.3141670074687
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the
piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	256.7479408552061
I won’t trespass
on your valuable time...	311.28085239319495
—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	477.2674437279202
Drop in whenever you like.	113.26141591027385
Next
week, say.	191.24436649619383
Can you see?	60.92039389475258
—Yes, yes.	60.45787357664621
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	728.8599008387894
Very pleased to have met you.	153.61839692497978
—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	444.8665637204516
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away
among the pillars.	260.0440137876919
With J.	203.15938669399281
He stood to read the card in his hand.	106.38682041905426
—The reverend Hugh C.	626.2654745030283
Love, Rathcoffey.	203.15938669399281
Present address: Saint
Michael’s, Sallins.	576.8761349154736
Nice young chap he is.	116.85329918693863
He’s writing a book about
the Fitzgeralds he told me.	148.07006324832076
He’s well up in history, faith.	164.9667581142858
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
twig.	366.9267799586688
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	314.29275730671253
O’Molloy said.	165.5081573229974
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	185.53081721373013
—God! he cried.	76.0021948691469
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	236.09665732246737
You know that one?	77.78884842282268
_I’m bloody
sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the
archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.	385.6257192824442
God, I’ll
tell him anyhow.	286.7088644896545
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	212.1888001282806
Hot
members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	143.25183799291452
He
slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
	434.5555993251271
—Woa, sonny!
	365.4416887200119
He turned to J.	172.05752927281063
O’Molloy and asked:
	151.73419238249812
—Well, Jack.	203.15938669399281
What is it?	44.73630436839303
What’s the trouble?	66.6231165019152
Hold hard.	109.93699766835074
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
instant, sneezed loudly.	292.3837662250316
—Chow! he said.	39.595082423913524
Blast you!
	32.76073075102579
—The dust from those sacks, J.	486.9179471658904
O’Molloy said politely.	387.86193962233654
cold night before...	119.16600552667765
night before last...	125.90273740226031
and there was a hell of a lot of
draught...	109.67097083165882
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	182.63727972429453
—I was...	32.5875824183266
Glasnevin this morning...	111.70485568228652
poor little...	63.367136603864665
what do you call
him...	98.56769241520253
Mother of Moses!
	106.7296495237354
Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
claret waistcoat.	339.1051978039367
Say it’s turn six.	131.61377126431293
In here, see.	98.02540777349999
Turn Now On.	494.0867752080217
He slid it into the left slot for them.	192.16257786339148
It shot down the groove,
wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	425.74590129789067
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly
female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
great amplitude.	434.02640431975226
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	237.91278210734245
The impact.	317.5334699131929
Leverage, see?	56.50786883456539
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	206.24948998544724
—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	593.0848506888144
So a fellow coming in late
can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	166.88707233193963
Tom Rochford said.	165.5081573229974
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	399.4967822193057
Turn Now On.	494.0867752080217
—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	166.4357881871651
One good
turn deserves another.	351.2677523595154
—Do, Tom Rochford said.	339.27239792854846
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.	349.37983081118267
—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly.	545.0697453225247
When you two begin...	154.75096780111082
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	369.11213447172224
—But how does it work here, Tommy?	262.8968457568576
he asked.	66.98244490415372
—Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	165.5081573229974
See you later.	128.7273381079319
He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.	427.3924621290711
—He’s a hero, he said simply.	111.35702151063602
The drain, you mean.	287.23319981284607
Lenehan said.	39.3877482893773
It was down a manhole.	133.87394870653026
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	563.8432413850456
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was.	382.3182176931438
One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,
half choked with sewer gas.	258.965798896806
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest
and all, with the rope round him.	314.2453638355453
And be damned but he got the rope
round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	172.209090335055
—The act of a hero, he said.	103.29864561898596
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
them for Jervis street.	297.3296448666159
—This way, he said, walking to the right.	89.1820476152537
I want to pop into Lynam’s to
see Sceptre’s starting price.	323.7674657973763
What’s the time by your gold watch and
chain?	134.25582840466984
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at
O’Neill’s clock.	840.1376105701426
—After three, he said.	71.77538901873426
Who’s riding her?	119.06095406091258
And a game filly she is.	186.34919293955545
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	406.13916168644806
Fellow might damn easy
get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	277.6533608535658
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
cavalcade.	289.19485899464496
—Even money, Lenehan said returning.	360.2022076254855
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an
earthly.	333.4805755941882
Through here.	64.56289892777333
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch.	226.54115948886343
A darkbacked figure
scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	483.94859232065204
—There he is, Lenehan said.	114.49862523260752
—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.	344.5987547961158
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.	149.25608126300952
—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said.	413.86851286129644
I was with him one day and he
bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	148.65385365777706
There were
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
comets with long tails.	211.80706682483324
Astronomy it was about.	59.312174071770315
Lenehan laughed.	130.51080469431187
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.	216.6164497969979
Come over
in the sun.	64.09475165531755
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
riverwall.	270.85162005367954
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s,
carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	320.5892934324721
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
eagerly.	375.7922692124523
Boiled shirt affair.	397.23843673588647
The lord
mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
Dawson spoke and there was music.	314.7856916930293
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin
Dollard...	494.5602268869579
—I know, M’Coy broke in.	355.0981384649436
My missus sang there once.	343.2047531451918
—Did she?	39.93019424155908
Lenehan said.	39.3877482893773
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number
7 Eccles street.	560.0133529140525
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	283.8221980460147
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	187.41211353104381
Delahunt of Camden street had the
catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	338.1706696364246
Bloom and the wife
were there.	69.03672349394134
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and
curacoa to which we did ample justice.	324.382738817197
Fast and furious it was.	93.63962850594177
After
liquids came solids.	758.7148224766042
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	1000.9514275806013
The year the missus was there...	132.14707185991793
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	397.6518439593754
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	187.41211353104381
We had a midnight lunch too after
all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
morning after the night before.	215.0177107435905
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
night on the Featherbed Mountain.	219.60096915537676
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	131.22648445747308
We started
singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	606.7495430811609
Every
jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	356.289210207456
Hell’s
delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	412.6883314132543
Like that.	29.63054047888148
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
	324.8264791397261
Know what I mean?	254.29939423455684
His hands moulded ample curves of air.	439.61712082458683
He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	288.97909903695324
—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	208.5160397178902
She’s a gamey
mare and no mistake.	204.83853930276248
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the
comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear
and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	188.84234661237338
But, by God, I
was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	222.43938776897951
He knows them all, faith.	194.46792978935642
At
last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away.	476.0847539781039
_And what star is that,
Poldy?_ says she.	165.22593200024943
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	509.66426750639795
_That one, is it?_
says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._
By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.	275.48853251375635
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
laughter.	293.6361521388828
—I’m weak, he gasped.	283.00589456881386
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	310.19752837378644
Lenehan
walked on again.	127.51509361236444
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
rapidly.	412.6808777490387
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.	339.9284305461247
—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	281.66663702537744
He’s not one
of your common or garden...	143.9488234169679
you know...	55.82832326580159
There’s a touch of the artist
about old Bloom.	148.7804428047725
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.	662.4316147435326
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of
slaughtered cows.	546.2922009575404
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the
world.	100.69213603356386
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	151.18443038561387
Child born every
minute somewhere.	393.8760382210249
Mrs Purefoy.	203.15938669399281
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the
Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	434.94230029577216
—That I had, he said, pushing it by.	168.6074527439569
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	335.57434380450854
—Them are two good ones, he said.	146.61105307368823
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	158.9063182093205
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	287.9812286758829
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.	697.3042609306063
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	292.0682446791921
_Fair Tyrants_ by James
Lovebirch.	518.6777291480659
Know the kind that is.	62.3497736146393
Had it?	30.60773084408939
He opened it.	114.37026054478356
Thought so.	50.1242710750977
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain.	230.1616611002757
Listen: the man.	38.20459309151699
No: she wouldn’t like that much.	135.86139633117946
Got her it once.	80.65466498222486
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	263.7733234163352
More in her line.	81.86401119020172
Let us see.	101.70763766610784
He read where his finger opened.	235.88164068848286
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
wondrous gowns and costliest frillies.	408.1812648505157
For him! For Raoul!_
	235.08472226677173
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._
	322.37041554272906
Take this.	54.159510926722085
The end.	102.17950527386172
—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	381.8268039576079
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	694.5312530037321
An imperceptible smile played
round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	351.49400173513317
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._
	397.64809862168056
Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	462.6209404841394
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).	611.8141109410299
Armpits’ oniony sweat.	945.167089190548
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).	922.1086877434531
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!
	770.4820652448411
Young! Young!
	203.15938669399281
An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the
lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of
appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean
Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	332.2316650523984
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains.	305.76661405052363
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing.	462.72914654049436
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on
the floor.	515.8331898855522
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along
it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	400.74664434482634
Mr Bloom beheld it.	315.4351282233454
Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
	144.39929507772737
—I’ll take this one.	150.16482044639568
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	607.9026828596624
—_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it.	116.43426544505377
That’s a good one.	64.09482007893253
The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.	283.6704040278789
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,
the cries of the auctioneer within.	231.81747655571593
Four and nine.	76.50422778457208
Those lovely
curtains.	336.11285814800107
Five shillings.	118.11431857441268
Cosy curtains.	236.7209714979307
Selling new at two guineas.	209.0762683808218
Any advance on five shillings?	336.4846904770593
Going for five shillings.	158.1801650855478
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
	278.0061163636266
Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	378.6503325651964
Jackson, W.	203.15938669399281
Wylie, A.	203.15938669399281
Munro and H.	109.91965027550245
Gahan, their stretched
necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	486.52701972208524
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.	395.22237057959904
He halted near his daughter.	218.51941722704512
—It’s time for you, she said.	76.58321667606164
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	203.97446314182872
Are
you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
shoulder?	409.46142445986936
Melancholy God!
	203.15938669399281
Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	325.8395429085518
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
held them back.	202.37668763145388
—Stand up straight, girl, he said.	142.76957164920404
You’ll get curvature of the spine.	213.72293935595718
Do you know what you look like?	104.51895142832947
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
and dropping his underjaw.	322.466939778815
—Give it up, father, Dilly said.	151.85256197443627
All the people are looking at you.	106.63265755374454
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	361.0484734818464
—Did you get any money?	146.9129946032074
Dilly asked.	75.71580409413632
—Where would I get money?	287.22200210846677
Mr Dedalus said.	165.5081573229974
There is no-one in Dublin
would lend me fourpence.	256.43040903907587
—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	174.39732858174798
—How do you know that?	78.94683137394529
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	200.78696197373523
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
James’s street.	347.86010226892324
—I know you did, Dilly answered.	235.46302546183205
Were you in the Scotch house now?	112.65819272430048
—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling.	268.6986020279985
Was it the little nuns
taught you to be so saucy?	189.26444460436053
He handed her a shilling.	157.40407106245786
—See if you can do anything with that, he said.	102.20206668169564
—I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	243.2818179130594
Give me more than that.	102.95786162614682
—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	804.5227439350713
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor
mother died.	511.5827749955111
But wait awhile.	245.8018567563399
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long
day from me.	160.82879054318408
Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you.	290.4097915050623
Wouldn’t
care if I was stretched out stiff.	335.7416395080826
He’s dead.	76.44241857724501
The man upstairs is dead.	217.1490880312283
He left her and walked on.	97.22875406399342
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	238.82592614231666
—Well, what is it?	57.78703597408876
he said, stopping.	161.98633895612122
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	480.31231470503064
—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	473.8001530817841
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell
but feebly:
	483.05120822816076
Mr Dedalus stared at him.	242.27486800258063
—Watch him, he said.	49.20682246735107
It’s instructive.	146.15176527424234
I wonder will he allow us to
talk.	207.80485230856468
—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	207.52439541765784
—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	246.03982284288603
I’ll leave you
all where Jesus left the jews.	226.51913108895965
Look, there’s all I have.	135.64601009565683
I got two
shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
funeral.	350.1774318653049
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	458.56814938374583
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere?	172.37635582456898
Dilly said.	39.3877482893773
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	266.6430981273046
—I will, he said gravely.	121.30001367384465
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell
street.	282.32359043977476
I’ll try this one now.	181.05224852679333
—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	492.564847359204
—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	500.23578125237674
Get a glass of milk
for yourself and a bun or a something.	138.93658005433733
I’ll be home shortly.	264.5430107861257
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	139.54500904313747
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
Parkgate.	598.9955968741972
—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	277.2417758658279
The lacquey banged loudly.	778.3664556144768
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
mincing mouth gently:
	425.3495570439464
—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do
anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!
	520.3257286557324
From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with
the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s
street, past Shackleton’s offices.	505.104225531131
Got round him all right.	107.41871810258597
How do you
do, Mr Crimmins?	271.0223219899474
First rate, sir.	241.33363147230787
I was afraid you might be up in your
other establishment in Pimlico.	196.3508825881783
How are things going?	156.54510965690343
Just keeping
alive.	406.0279696694463
Lovely weather we’re having.	283.49336983006407
Yes, indeed.	141.3356023164092
Good for the country.	62.643658257258714
Those farmers are always grumbling.	603.8260364675144
I’ll just take a thimbleful of your
best gin, Mr Crimmins.	398.6275949898768
A small gin, sir.	394.82964110526956
Yes, sir.	71.8721773002824
Terrible affair that
_General Slocum_ explosion.	852.6205276603066
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	927.3720672784453
And heartrending scenes.	805.2966518766614
Men trampling down women and children.	277.05301178508427
Most
brutal thing.	339.0953165795804
What do they say was the cause?	108.58244691306352
Spontaneous combustion.	287.3919172316162
Most scandalous revelation.	787.5548644660721
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever
allowed a boat like that...	285.2233832091958
Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	459.8214980089028
You know why?	115.81116426447431
Palm oil.	174.05411526313088
Is that a fact?	68.35518203370583
Without a doubt.	99.4460311525303
Well now, look
at that.	95.32947622333486
And America they say is the land of the free.	119.74509570600117
I thought we
were bad here.	199.77099334204559
I smiled at him.	110.96701945234066
_America,_ I said quietly, just like that.	177.6932533138174
_What is
it?	44.73630436839303
Isn’t that true?_
That’s a fact.	149.2814096675219
Graft, my dear sir.	148.067543431511
Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s
always someone to pick it up.	157.900373374826
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	184.3788744711203
Dress does it.	82.72415975155268
Nothing like a dressy
appearance.	230.67144913565892
Bowls them over.	80.81804189783632
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	521.8984454213411
How are things?	115.82538575362706
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	675.4243655135759
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
Kennedy, hairdresser.	529.7042274042941
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	275.5643644420485
Scott of Dawson
street.	137.90427250599456
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.	314.42762840142035
Fits me down to the ground.	79.37569484448426
Some Kildare street
club toff had it probably.	421.7475951069143
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
remembered me.	288.9124246721187
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	275.2964825434237
Knight of the road.	48.656876214821864
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
again, sir.	287.56691220288667
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
has it.	215.68369151232733
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	299.67685186175686
High colour, of course.	118.58830157549801
Grizzled moustache.	156.73716971662776
Returned Indian officer.	516.2519738027555
Bravely he bore his stumpy
body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	441.3434753308769
Is that Ned
Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam?	253.1297578648965
He’s as like it as damn
it.	97.20434478820253
The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	167.76443486055757
Damn like him.	59.46143109085171
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	463.8883274640858
Good drop of gin, that was.	153.95870654090126
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to
his fat strut.	538.0177192461377
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	373.9478443516875
Greasy black rope.	270.5367709878111
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife
drove by in her noddy.	201.34033248809484
Bad times those were.	156.30353657408187
Over and done with.	67.85335348899001
Great topers too.	282.23259047130705
Fourbottle men.	81.43773038555204
Let me see.	74.57324301981852
Is he buried in saint Michan’s?	184.48227747730212
Or no, there was a midnight
burial in Glasnevin.	210.82025891880892
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
wall.	130.45770978373227
Dignam is there now.	82.0242547479311
Went out in a puff.	94.22721235468266
Better turn
down here.	164.9725588187678
Make a detour.	163.73695834995112
Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the
corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom.	276.5831724901891
Outside the Dublin
Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey
stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	434.79581820916655
Damn dangerous thing.	372.39814711904046
Some
Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	401.89420083962324
Runaway
horse.	114.43820905442307
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for
the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	435.3287646143837
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	691.7872800882517
Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.	504.24718049643343
When you look back on it all now
in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	144.38809753329733
Gaming at Daly’s.	128.0794119492292
No
cardsharping then.	342.3684830693359
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the
table by a dagger.	172.02056641315698
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from
major Sirr.	787.6192102476097
Stables behind Moira house.	305.1349072240575
Damn good gin that was.	150.09126521005044
Fine dashing young nobleman.	724.0482560644336
That ruffian, that
sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	388.7314440785734
Course they were on
the wrong side.	112.2376045347821
They rose in dark and evil days.	195.98539683078295
Fine poem that is:
Ingram.	269.51394801240036
They were gentlemen.	158.06854901549798
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
touchingly.	613.2690628154049
Masterly rendition.	365.4416887200119
_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._
	197.28565097019666
A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
leaping in their, in their saddles.	564.2279382013423
Cream sunshades.	317.52817152557833
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	1130.6217589864978
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	403.1533119004553
Damn it! What a
pity!
	158.67879319189362
Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s
fingers prove a timedulled chain.	467.19709552812174
Dust webbed the window and the
showtrays.	179.56065623202574
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	433.75613854037994
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on
rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	520.3125936332315
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
shining in the darkness.	310.7989005196728
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
them.	643.6912379688961
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	551.6029898585601
A sailorman,
rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	494.696704222418
A long and seafed
silent rut.	389.0959233605495
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	634.6292323415469
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned
it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.	302.56952824384643
Grandfather ape
gloating on a stolen hoard.	588.9467423473628
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	285.1157216128151
The brainsick words
of sophists: Antisthenes.	602.4598860578946
A lore of drugs.	334.0017153273812
Orient and immortal wheat
standing from everlasting to everlasting.	377.9347618904711
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	404.2464085402994
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	438.1174417808397
Beingless beings.	249.71993668557914
Stop! Throb always
without you and the throb always within.	240.83685504342625
Your heart you sing of.	114.00420804243953
I
between them.	106.21066832351727
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	603.7837292810173
Shatter them, one and both.	92.74360767514828
But stun myself too in the blow.	245.43792276797336
Shatter me
you who can.	97.12739715963964
Bawd and butcher were the words.	113.92394280956664
I say! Not yet awhile.	457.7805865486986
A
look around.	171.33348794833407
Yes, quite true.	203.82621677512518
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.	262.87775586647194
You
say right, sir.	152.84714899621093
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
his shoulderblade.	339.4615389194213
In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
boxing Sayers held his eye.	534.7793553337763
Staring backers with square hats stood
round the roped prizering.	552.9207207904603
The heavyweights in tight loincloths
proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	645.2052962866242
And they are
throbbing: heroes’ hearts.	481.4155372435642
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	246.70408845193612
—Twopence each, the huckster said.	165.25506091237537
Four for sixpence.	159.1257281179329
Tattered pages.	152.28024069459843
_The Irish Beekeeper.	494.0867752080217

	199.18735338682959
I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes.	313.51963733826005
_Stephano Dedalo,
alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._
	1462.3644417169849
Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.	428.49926043168153
Binding too good probably.	181.88906214263457
What is this?	65.40039978533191
Eighth and ninth book of
Moses.	221.1010013684472
Secret of all secrets.	98.44859331822376
Seal of King David.	244.1449739478468

How to win a woman’s love.	117.76759703149874
For me this.	72.78475281824353
Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:
	302.7950523744201
—_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._
	1346.404860658299
Who wrote this?	149.7213416625583
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
Salanka to all true believers divulged.	421.9295506677007
As good as any other abbot’s
charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.	357.25710634661414
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your
wool.	501.9077392415616
—What are you doing here, Stephen?	228.905952200311
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.	272.32527877063154
Shut the book quick.	112.38548080410912
Don’t let see.	118.70058120577863
—What are you doing?	113.71896553040249
Stephen said.	39.3877482893773
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	710.1959415024639
It
glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	387.62474807039575
I told her
of Paris.	138.01254614312924
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.	700.0011494426903
_Nebrakada femininum._
	184.79456031736208
—What have you there?	71.17665575784584
Stephen asked.	75.71580409413632
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
nervously.	251.276982568987
My eyes they say she has.	127.74407828356131
Do others see me so?	145.0717169413874
Quick, far and daring.	205.20298695702553
Shadow of my mind.	77.79638800278988
He took the coverless book from her hand.	188.46245881512803
Chardenal’s French primer.	367.4902776092098
—What did you buy that for?	107.8628731800666
he asked.	66.98244490415372
To learn French?	404.03590466386964
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	433.0585445743327
Show no surprise.	168.2469366363603
Quite natural.	126.18729046306154
—Here, Stephen said.	165.5081573229974
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.	257.7441850593763
I suppose all my books are gone.	224.19916803337577
—Some, Dilly said.	165.5081573229974
We had to.	44.038583346708556
She is drowning.	152.58517964178674
Save her.	34.64317786172705
All against us.	134.6799072214876
She will
drown me with her, eyes and hair.	154.29853012854966
Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
my heart, my soul.	323.1297929674875
Salt green death.	184.31378668596386
Agenbite of inwit.	109.87096133473105
Inwit’s agenbite.	146.14851395391557
Misery! Misery!
	203.15938669399281
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	521.8984454213411
How are things?	115.82538575362706
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	675.4243655135759
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s.	445.3509279727743
Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	452.0062290248624
—What’s the best news?	102.45274109623257
Mr Dedalus said.	165.5081573229974
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	282.2266767507266
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	397.1280826152202
Who is it?	44.73630436839303
—O, Father Cowley said.	339.27239792854846
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	346.75881387722086
—With a broken back, is it?	104.83352897033117
Reuben of that ilk.	99.74280040346665
I’m just
waiting for Ben Dollard.	361.4840485412232
He’s going to say a word to long John to get
him to take those two men off.	152.60963295117796
All I want is a little time.	170.2586975843663
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck.	226.2074850999207
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	436.3910029335163
Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always
doing a good turn for someone.	374.17526883009145
Hold hard!
	109.93699766835074
He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	226.97592043556222
—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	159.45721008215378
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	438.44910663207605
He came towards
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	505.90827606815293
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
	439.49820482541907
—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	117.10650701029071
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	255.7313015480039
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
Dollard’s figure.	598.2525450897434
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he
muttered sneeringly:
	383.5924403600718
—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?	171.9732098892044
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	624.9612584702246
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
	442.62576395885264
—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	180.72597379281882
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	254.5153585779585
Thanks be to
God he’s not paid yet.	159.78528075842178
—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	435.7416004667732
Father Cowley asked.	255.87999104604643
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	1169.128405359808
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth
a deep note.	390.9799972655634
—Aw! he said.	39.595082423913524
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	312.2978245106672
—What about that?	55.36712022076279
Ben Dollard said.	165.5081573229974
Not too dusty?	208.78362283927626
He turned to both.	115.49072915490532
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	436.0929469787094
The reverend Hugh C.	626.2654745030283
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles.	460.33920809004263
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air.	273.8397248988614
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.	107.99749369598557
I want to show
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	204.06218118248924
He’s a cross between
Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	220.4307310813618
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.	214.51459099132543
Come along.	89.45905125811306
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
cost me a fall if I don’t...	339.844185989025
Wait awhile...	177.74094089514128
We’re on the right lay,
Bob, believe you me.	189.58922762515877
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	351.3322325748144
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	423.7522796584051
—What few days?	193.206047051976
he boomed.	216.05461328616468
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?	406.4033744767318
—He has, Father Cowley said.	330.93667819478776
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
Dollard said.	249.08696153493747
The landlord has the prior claim.	394.46217269623315
I gave him all the
particulars.	140.19296576513173
29 Windsor avenue.	483.04221353745453
Love is the name?	53.57152513498671
—That’s right, Father Cowley said.	253.88941067425378
The reverend Mr Love.	626.2654745030283
He’s a
minister in the country somewhere.	129.32775844879666
But are you sure of that?	76.86786900467737
—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
writ where Jacko put the nuts.	312.29416198877595
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	617.758514698489
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
glasses on his coatfront, following them.	342.95603041302525
—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
passed out of the Castleyard gate.	276.1159130283385
The policeman touched his forehead.	365.6442933161458
—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	558.8893328802454
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards Lord Edward street.	311.43373136134056
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared
above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	341.3799028170248
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	473.9322581333692
I wrote to Father
Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	243.7822733070584
—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	743.765592608508
Touch me not.	63.119218805026925
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down Cork hill.	575.0808297165604
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	750.9586854678478
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	736.9330479063665
—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
office.	535.349483947709
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	238.73622128584284
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	327.8109176115804
And put down the
five shillings too.	160.85899235175077
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	337.3793540936059
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	525.0151395599286
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	658.2524163328522
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	277.1145861904206
They went down Parliament street.	256.24220202273005
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.	494.8340126049248
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	339.27239792854846
Here goes.	125.17961479271972
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	834.3974984275985
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.	518.319397215022
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John
Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	814.5262305881373
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.	384.3949108141843
The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	517.4403626715625
Martin Cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
glance.	474.41897957553397
—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
life.	429.69810073650336
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	323.07119918327953
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted.	432.5459980137762
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	274.51954942640975
He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
their faces.	554.9458026544953
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	771.9275843369804
he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	351.4204430039136
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
about their damned Irish language.	520.3249018496512
Where was the marshal, he wanted to
know, to keep order in the council chamber.	170.75420011276705
And old Barlow the
macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	387.13198288299117
Damned Irish language,
language of our forefathers.	410.32679634773
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	334.7338006800057
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to
the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
his peace.	377.9813864594368
—What Dignam was that?	117.54063837981339
long John Fanning asked.	470.39340133043726
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	258.7892243937369
—O, my corns! he said plaintively.	234.6170953985392
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake
till I sit down somewhere.	600.7186019468991
Uff! Ooo! Mind!
	494.0867752080217
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
passed in and up the stairs.	230.7576429485583
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.	182.5732078270341
I don’t think
you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	176.7614724683885
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	647.8779427024033
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	337.74844843407317
—Rather lowsized.	464.672675952932
Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham
said.	219.85146944762343
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	317.0889254675331
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	206.51107818581576
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
Martin Cunningham said.	165.5081573229974
All turned where they stood.	173.81618528652243
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	388.63891905767804
From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	330.7961046709263
Gaily they went
past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	310.181873931704
In saddles of the
leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	638.2012574584588
—What was it?	41.07499382372229
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
staircase.	171.63906113857843
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	521.177546335552
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
Panama to Haines:
	543.5198058312559
—Parnell’s brother.	86.25326690998207
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	372.57285809515264
—Is that he?	34.28474813271015
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	222.20446043904727
—Yes, Mulligan said.	165.5081573229974
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	399.9245279583626
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	418.7190832791653
An instant after,
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
fell once more upon a working corner.	360.76218763286107
—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.	209.60264119257315
—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.	484.1996780718713
And bring us some scones and
butter and some cakes as well.	273.92474138819114
When she had gone he said, laughing:
	126.56075980474789
—We call it D.B.C.	488.68530635785066
O, but you missed
Dedalus on _Hamlet._
	262.8092181433473
Haines opened his newbought book.	352.61466503463856
—I’m sorry, he said.	126.56669069847221
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
minds that have lost their balance.	228.29361232170442
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
	422.7041260110606
—_England expects_...	464.672675952932
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	417.7999930491391
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	232.51627264835807
Wandering Ængus I call him.	366.0183345221836
—I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	427.1129103483725
Now I am speculating what it
would be likely to be.	267.8414595275258
Such persons always have.	256.1096059451825
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	351.833816950749
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	288.2375191894778
He will never
capture the Attic note.	347.0447441969567
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth.	201.5942494165023
That is his tragedy.	130.21536196434178
He can never be a poet.	142.85588061801
The joy of creation...	211.0935946246146
—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	782.4805635794139
I tackled him
this morning on belief.	338.8643345937961
There was something on his mind, I saw.	183.17240930103105
It’s
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
interesting point out of that.	300.112274871064
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	322.94571827877047
He helped her to
unload her tray.	299.9870205935108
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
the cheerful cups.	499.51802164145806
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
of retribution.	425.72034300046954
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	260.1746957404899
Does he write anything for your movement?	201.33309849786363
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	579.922016110969
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
its smoking pith.	575.5486021155867
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	154.5616891440603
He is going to write
something in ten years.	163.9592807552046
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	314.75191415892147
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.	266.603145392242
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	277.1025466852177
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	324.5489700958866
I don’t
want to be imposed on.	159.282163846069
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
from Bridgwater with bricks.	691.139509702612
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.	565.4520462897623
Distantly behind him
a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	226.08915687035977
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	787.6870381854831
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke’s lawn.	295.8814825394241
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	332.43123899413166
With ratsteeth
bared he muttered:
	626.8860752537632
—_Coactus volui._
	202.92359078335122
He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	408.88490998462805
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
having buffeted a thewless body.	616.0804075886529
The blind stripling turned his sickly
face after the striding form.	377.18498333046716
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder
nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!
	390.3806618591267
Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been
sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	513.6205936363488
It was too blooming
dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.	364.6107846952722
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
blooming time and sighing.	383.7433067189166
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
stopped him.	598.6011881311147
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
pelts and putting up their props.	280.72467864381207
From the sidemirrors two mourning
Masters Dignam gaped silently.	853.5905244536275
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will
meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of
fifty sovereigns.	617.5439395869658
Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.	179.15038930090682
Myler
Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	173.7266754437743
Two bar
entrance, soldiers half price.	726.8202326085221
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	270.5202793053105
Master
Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	160.64337297912343
That’s me in mourning.	90.07294675271515
When is
it?	44.73630436839303
May the twentysecond.	135.0889093418962
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	132.86277802785227
He
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap
awry, his collar sticking up.	236.54410475483652
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he
saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
puckers.	321.66391585845287
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
out.	218.85573778150695
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	248.4402409669646
The best pucker going
for strength was Fitzsimons.	388.75434611386567
One puck in the wind from that fellow
would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	192.5765683248593
But the best pucker
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out
of him, dodging and all.	319.6315858031557
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
telling him and grinning all the time.	206.8354774288887
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand.	344.2351830961111
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	216.21822962547566
The
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
end to it.	248.446926880541
He met schoolboys with satchels.	430.3390219195079
I’m not going tomorrow
either, stay away till Monday.	461.8876043328764
He met other schoolboys.	317.68833858827134
Do they notice
I’m in mourning?	275.3972790827468
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.	185.71375222309027
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
name.	143.88968868779097
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
fly walking over it up to his eye.	159.4850464143499
The scrunch that was when they were
screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
bringing it downstairs.	254.1713176961302
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
the men how to get it round the bend.	202.06389866923556
How was that?	40.27220657095264
Never see him again.	100.19292705262916
Death, that is.	43.620860083286054
Pa is dead.	89.31113874496783
My father is dead.	120.1033454418274
He
told me to be a good son to ma.	130.31840104414306
I couldn’t hear the other things he
said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	185.06195691418608
Poor
pa.	174.05701931214955
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	268.87355773673295
I hope he’s in purgatory now because
he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	258.79797659752353
William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the
viceregal lodge.	546.4312004582786
In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs
Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.	479.01432859471356
in
attendance.	186.15292118384926
The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
quays.	497.8437275046228
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
metropolis.	295.6578310653647
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
him vainly from afar.	699.3053739580567
Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord
Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
White, B.	668.5432780018405
L., M.	203.15938669399281
A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M.	570.2151548559808
White’s,
the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose
with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	354.2265584241936
In the
porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	354.6914414473772
Past Richmond bridge at the
doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously
on the representative of His Majesty.	450.4825039278643
From its sluice in Wood quay wall
under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
liquid sewage.	577.561713375998
Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by
bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired.	329.7837708004232
On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse
for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his
hat low.	391.6191283364596
His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting.	1550.0123689912498
From
Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C.	347.9410902200396
Love, M.	203.15938669399281
A., made obeisance
unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held
of yore rich advowsons.	894.9871522885035
On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking
leave of each other, watched the carriages go by.	424.14356252301826
Passing by Roger
Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,
carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid
up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she
couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s
big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its
being the lord lieutenant.	287.779239055444
Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of
Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	502.10355642414515
The
Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	975.8544954858564
O., passed
Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax
smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_
James.	852.9676483518842
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the
approach of the cavalcade.	465.8772682515832
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley
fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret
waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	229.98543869208325
A charming _soubrette,_ great
Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from
her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon
lieutenantcolonel H.	716.4681709569297
Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald
Ward A.	350.45572604941646
From the window of the D.	79.67790061141922
Buck Mulligan gaily, and
Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders
of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon
John Howard Parnell looked intently.	640.9360635560892
In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus,
straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw
sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	663.6696126917637
John Henry
Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from
winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in
his fat left hand not feeling it.	439.7887224610786
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	172.99291389064024
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the
second carriage.	220.02015882576373
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	882.4387949083407
C., agreeably
surprised, made haste to reply.	707.0535162938472
At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white
flagon H.	497.7999990527732
halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,
E.L.Y.’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages.	803.6644403752889
Opposite Pigott’s
music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily
apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.	789.4687403633212
By
the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl’s a Yorkshire
girl._
	396.367574004533
His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
the red flower between his lips.	197.08678859080555
As they drove along Nassau street His
Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
music which was being discoursed in College park.	362.89499937602505
Unseen brazen
highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_:
	757.7411364753966
But though she’s a factory lass
	205.50187274981332
Yet I’ve a sort of a
	159.28739592046415
Yorkshire relish for
	164.7148098577769
My little Yorkshire rose.	318.36189958287804

Adderly and W.	109.91965027550245
Huggard, started in pursuit.	277.37154413972485
Striding
past Finn’s hotel Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell
stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr
M.	638.4175500300051
Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.	196.26508862136316
Deep in Leinster street by Trinity’s postern a loyal king’s man,
Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap.	413.81721544595564
As the glossy horses pranced by
Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes
being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black
cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper.	534.2808645454951
His collar too sprang up.	286.3645007995199
The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds
for Mercer’s hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount
street.	358.90062059607635
He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent’s.	314.39008609428754
In Lower
Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,
passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’s path.	466.9527311818814
At the Royal
Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips
agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township.	834.9179375859972
At Haddington road
corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in
which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady
mayoress without his golden chain.	402.5365819268866
On Northumberland and Lansdowne
roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male
walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the
house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the
Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the
salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing
door.	415.7567509364021

My eppripfftaph.	464.672675952932
Be pfrwritt.	464.672675952932
Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the
crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
steel.	303.7340137756829
—Is that her?	42.15007115571141
asked miss Kennedy.	275.4144470460144
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._
	401.6368990334325
—Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	384.10655236560024
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
	437.27866952994714
—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	104.88760424524864
gold asked more eagerly.	255.18172422192941
—In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the
sun.	214.38784933766465
He’s looking.	79.25452366058212
Mind till I see.	263.0158899434605
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	346.66715167828676
Her wet lips tittered:
	537.7315554171456
—He’s killed looking back.	187.50722534460934
She laughed:
	130.51080469431187
—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?	878.284655373521
With sadness.	464.672675952932
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
behind an ear.	566.4394441431426
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
hair.	354.23981612156064
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	400.41875056271095
—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	167.82894181663374
A man.	56.04326828471096
Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of
sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	438.11422826890436
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	169.71236319489878
For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.	288.68662948144464
—There’s your teas, he said.	117.73078352889448
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	544.9106300372381
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
loud boots unmannerly asked.	426.85381560707606
—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	605.334082429318
—Your _beau,_ is it?	154.04912700254286
A haughty bronze replied:
	635.9246013995088
—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence.	438.46754959628015
—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
she threatened as he had come.	457.34873146973575
—Most aggravating that young brat is.	354.9790842042225
If he doesn’t conduct himself
I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	299.057522265783
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	266.7570377460789
—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	557.9747309244088
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	215.20629571664804
They cowered
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
waiting for their teas to draw.	554.7351184747416
They pawed their blouses, both of black
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
seven.	291.78363711668436
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,
hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	569.1125989631016
—Am I awfully sunburnt?	903.4336512709086
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	403.97672431329437
—No, said miss Kennedy.	220.18138879220166
It gets brown after.	268.0966140300375
Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water?	269.8335037379832
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
midst a shell.	438.64582821639715
—And leave it to my hands, she said.	116.04312906806747
—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	289.44607828689703
—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	455.5895013609879
I asked that
old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.	200.12173510809666
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
	510.9626838725323
—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!
	206.04782563119508
—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	553.6088792935718
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
with little fingers.	486.8093854444002
—No, don’t, she cried.	140.56004021578266
—I won’t listen, she cried.	239.2021646357585
But Bloom?	203.15938669399281
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:
	702.1925909125576
—For your what?	72.31808109401435
says he.	25.478264492909325
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
again:
	304.50447155685106
—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire.	236.6205029563812
The hideous old wretch! That
night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	542.2843663355135
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	804.6353023988094
—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
ruffling her nosewings.	444.940385743783
Hufa! Hufa!
	203.15938669399281
Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat.	428.4340750267206
Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
snout in quest.	501.22318612468814
—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	679.1706780133632
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	259.74616697624856
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
	528.2349548153435
—And your other eye!
	142.97157582856457
Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name.	377.5550036404535
Why do I always think
Figather?	419.85972068605474
Gathering figs, I think.	661.2486411119089
And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.	468.2849764171604
By
Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by.	334.9408464735427
Bluerobed, white
under, come to me.	123.92735112112572
God they believe she is: or goddess.	181.73378270969283
Those today.	104.97859235390712
I
could not see.	104.49659597040535
That fellow spoke.	202.5163168562702
A student.	161.75487270836388
After with Dedalus’ son.	199.33512569362037
He might be Mulligan.	219.59646402533568
All comely virgins.	517.5240549901158
That brings those rakes of
fellows in: her white.	246.35188357720736
By went his eyes.	93.22849663455473
Sweet are the sweets.	98.77568208257102
Of sin.	144.63316540358124
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
your other eye.	644.599601839371
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
high piercing notes.	591.8502214488268
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	812.20868867244
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled.	527.0668897707167
Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes.	535.4163047307869
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her
fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
coughing with choking, crying:
	533.6953232326616
—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	220.3099830609868
With his bit of beard!
	110.27954963661601
Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
delight, joy, indignation.	473.5389828759937
—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	207.10766250259542
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	591.0609955054299
And then laughed more.	171.98672846852855
Greasy I
knows.	319.28570886394556
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	587.5831124318132
All flushed (O!),
panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	1104.516533564697
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	209.72404580926664
—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	616.2872922403195
I
wished I hadn’t laughed so much.	492.9372835198464
I feel all wet.	185.16783447264476
—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	818.168446839596
You horrid thing!
	301.3449004451944
And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	487.3640717314927
By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of
their oils.	535.9899156544711
Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at
doors as I.	405.68600898804897
Religion pays.	216.98246382346196
Must see him for that par.	126.43592126856441
Eat first.	66.0501842233661
Not yet.	100.44525951168114
At four, she said.	102.54293118787521
Time ever passing.	183.78443886875155
Clockhands
turning.	124.20844047526026
Where eat?	126.17886980988847
The Clarence, Dolphin.	494.0867752080217
For Raoul.	203.15938669399281
If I
net five guineas with those ads.	556.1800984916301
The violet silk petticoats.	523.0380660831574
Not yet.	100.44525951168114
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	825.2066976314095
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	648.3667750502864
Chips, picking chips off one of his
rocky thumbnails.	372.7022629539623
He strolled.	236.73282115525478
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.	409.6630797677664
He held her hand.	130.10477550752773
Enjoyed her holidays?	202.58240310110924
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	370.5191194513252
—Gorgeous, she said.	55.29788464652819
Look at the holy show I am.	212.14109763240066
Lying out on the
strand all day.	101.54966348057057
Bronze whiteness.	317.52817152557833
—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
her hand indulgently.	333.3049777245474
Tempting poor simple males.	395.1150298896737
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	413.98054776772017
—O go away! she said.	119.13393677175014
You’re very simple, I don’t think.	358.2086125805996
He was.	32.5875824183266
—Well now I am, he mused.	288.1700726963728
I looked so simple in the cradle they
christened me simple Simon.	321.6920700606086
—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	352.4709067996528
And what did the
doctor order today?	185.59481565433302
—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	250.00834807453305
I think I’ll trouble
you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	259.41047713527473
—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	496.87641320011716
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s
she turned herself.	333.2955799516495
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
her crystal keg.	389.60167506527404
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
pouch and pipe.	300.3873324477524
Alacrity she served.	148.16663725267537
He blew through the flue two husky
fifenotes.	566.8493383404208
—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	413.00961068235813
Must be
a great tonic in the air down there.	128.5328146123609
But a long threatening comes at
last, they say.	211.41714518063333
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into
the bowl.	334.10389064734665
None nought said nothing.	215.089317523855
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
	599.4508989648606
—_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_
	237.3402286195785
—Was Mr Lidwell in today?	328.8890333095882
In came Lenehan.	253.05443754653265
Round him peered Lenehan.	316.6975887277763
Mr Bloom reached Essex
bridge.	759.3497415325322
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	556.759399194396
To Martha I must write.	520.8405480692994
Buy paper.	98.03816495330732
Daly’s.	29.459917166355844
Girl there civil.	191.10100019773694
Old Bloom.	203.15938669399281
Blue bloom is on
the rye.	94.17300549714375
—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	216.18420758168753
Lenehan came forward.	157.71457611305485
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	297.8763056787765
He asked.	75.71580409413632
She answered:
	108.7308941271073
—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	457.85357104877806
She asked.	75.71580409413632
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
gaze upon a page:
	349.1617933129009
He was not.	51.62970223707327
Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.	246.2757537321281
Lenehan round the
sandwichbell wound his round body round.	259.5175349054891
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?	98.96452896529455
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	430.86786288882337
To mind her
stops.	209.9601804734763
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	278.3532797194625
Jingle jaunty jingle.	534.0171071104334
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	143.99479293478424
Take no notice.	151.6559063997198
She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
	462.9369874910963
—Ah fox met ah stork.	617.1658177576302
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	711.4564795180856
He droned in vain.	315.1673553588146
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	257.2936933673303
He sighed aside:
	366.5765829181067
—Ah me! O my!
	167.7040675798798
He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	379.4800619665218
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	131.85137984119132
—Who may he be?	85.6441756081065
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	504.60945080342145
—Who may he be?	85.6441756081065
he asked.	66.98244490415372
Can you ask?	99.0221983847016
Stephen, the youthful bard.	219.8844977744877
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	489.8247109135979
—I see, he said.	61.21326021120972
I didn’t recognise him for the moment.	163.82123425737237
I hear he is
keeping very select company.	328.6652728694082
He had.	45.53102268675821
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	270.7480608294573
In
Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the
rhino for the labour of his muse.	360.63042530824004
He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
	297.1715474241521
—The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	373.87109335094794
The ponderous pundit, Hugh
MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel
boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of
the O’Madden Burke.	489.32738492728174
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
	435.59232234763124
—That must have been highly diverting, said he.	241.99440903289357
He see.	56.50786883456539
He drank.	148.2722109817067
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	721.3868581807678
Set down his
glass.	114.98364267725194
He looked towards the saloon door.	221.7656086013492
—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	446.7621208304941
—Is that a fact?	68.35518203370583
—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy?	175.12221234383506
The real classical, you know.	256.2132725856134
And blind too,
poor fellow.	226.7841847105623
Not twenty I’m sure he was.	229.56294160208796
—Is that a fact?	68.35518203370583
Mr Dedalus said.	165.5081573229974
He drank and strayed away.	266.7867953690386
—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	311.5579228852171
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.	235.7895167598204
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.	198.16758863478557
To the door of the bar and
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of
Ormond.	383.10844769698815
Lager for diner.	168.88964421853092
Lager without alacrity she served.	370.41604927062195
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
jinglejaunty blazes boy.	632.1735782915018
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the
oblique triple (piano!) wires.	298.64562753426804
He pressed (the same who pressed
indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the
thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in
action.	340.05611969611084
Are you not
happy in your home?	131.97255301178177
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	270.9154355776972
Means
something, language of flow.	200.80085150996356
Was it a daisy?	119.94866486706441
Innocence that is.	43.620860083286054
Respectable girl meet after mass.	317.4607994545103
Thanks awfully muchly.	610.8712931436855
Wise Bloom
eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	467.48989049017234
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	457.15589739676864
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	886.2143201871785
For
some man.	95.91521952484074
For Raoul.	203.15938669399281
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat
riding on a jaunting car.	375.7897298208739
It is.	37.17489727918392
Third time.	59.26338156361836
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	333.28338055313947
Risk it.	30.60773084408939
Go quick.	118.12613677020784
At four.	96.20811568147619
Near now.	56.330396450281164
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	214.55488014572904
I was forgetting...	147.81715718789138
—And four.	96.20811568147619
At four she.	101.42211809881438
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	207.45640431752545
Bloo smi qui go.	718.0001908978788
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?	156.37784990837096
Does that to all.	44.00585959648728
For men.	81.43773038555204
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	407.7925627353643
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	167.45236007723443
That was a tuningfork the
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	159.71662011396577
A call again.	140.29516039040357
That he now
poised that it now throbbed.	200.5465155147999
You hear?	86.19829124840263
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	1112.314676158758
Longer in dying call.	142.47092637766582
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
Douce.	450.6906184096629
—_The bright stars fade_...	599.7854376127685
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
	653.5461855991457
_the morn is breaking._
	225.45101596346686
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
hands.	937.123735814975
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s
leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.	283.3086376725179
—_The dewdrops pearl_...	1247.7144807542668
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	274.9297042824568
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	168.33636910056637
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	214.12104302814583
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily rose.	569.586510905667
—Did she fall or was she pushed?	174.75273626396023
he asked her.	72.4653143537343
She answered, slighting:
	473.9268337751211
—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.	203.853846637381
Like lady, ladylike.	356.60174087172567
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode.	397.62226838807663
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	281.86107636919445
Lenehan heard and
knew and hailed him:
	153.2451718674332
—See the conquering hero comes.	335.9610949782404
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
hero.	520.5688474050354
See me he might.	75.32804199801082
The seat he sat on: warm.	210.914730704168
Black wary hecat
walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	1171.5191800637635
—_And I from thee_...	394.0806807146094
—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	278.14077029242634
She smiled
on him.	101.67076869786169
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
hair, a bosom and a rose.	300.2321086010053
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	1444.664035904669
—What’s your cry?	117.44109400116021
Glass of bitter?	99.9658932368221
Glass of bitter, please, and a
sloegin for me.	160.4837030952522
Wire in yet?	74.50415838853807
Not yet.	100.44525951168114
At four she.	101.42211809881438
Who said four?	100.83183113256382
Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s
office.	191.5726393203768
Goulding a chance.	91.317786558934
What is he doing in the Ormond?	102.8997266076945
Where off to?	52.923601173988274
Something to eat?	81.31053418397356
I too was just.	91.87107956572335
In here.	64.56289892777333
What,
Ormond?	203.15938669399281
Best value in Dublin.	255.00360359618085
Is that so?	53.64936247183686
Sit tight there.	145.03030676383213
See, not be seen.	114.6262704205925
I think I’ll join you.	354.26246756770433
Come on.	32.610077424956444
Richie led on.	118.23707078586469
Bloom
followed bag.	273.9636720503264
Dinner fit for a prince.	158.50725665816898
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
bust, that all but burst, so high.	387.9088711688728
—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	1115.1487866436719
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	316.27943838883454
—Why don’t you grow?	164.86188264887568
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
syrupped with her voice:
	350.89779204838464
—Fine goods in small parcels.	361.1936739520906
That is to say she.	70.0076972855038
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	646.1826130855792
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.	251.30026832615704
He pitched a broad coin down.	375.21900127364955
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	283.6854454195247
—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	428.0493839024414
—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	148.70670866975135
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	342.88223695611293
Not on my own, you
know.	102.34162070456118
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	324.8485107546449
The eastern seas.	584.582307780802
Clock whirred.	287.39671252413314
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
bearing away teatray.	500.7709860797209
Clock clacked.	287.3919172316162
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	574.3973376236464
It
clanged.	365.4416887200119
Clock clacked.	287.3919172316162
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
and hummed and handed coins in change.	255.2667747834071
Look to the west.	62.579360754405656
A clack.	365.4416887200119
For
me.	43.12221257392657
—What time is that?	67.64375444684761
O’clock.	138.29917444927327
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged
Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.	904.6416308480165
—Let’s hear the time, he said.	70.34521940430253
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered
tables.	1009.7127922844766
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table
near the door.	432.18569836649357
Be near.	89.7308842152844
At four.	96.20811568147619
Has he forgotten?	100.78300785593602
Perhaps a trick.	98.42272066635557
Not
come: whet appetite.	638.7690484172932
I couldn’t do.	148.4901692134335
Wait, wait.	88.86839359446913
Pat, waiter, waited.	408.79068129787436
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.	550.7522063991144
—Go on, pressed Lenehan.	312.66593317897355
He never heard.	133.06392266825048
_to Flora’s lips did hie._
	286.1218727244191
High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	270.63287128694424
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes
Boylan’s flower and eyes.	351.50076678621946
—Please, please.	121.44283619207401
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	622.1661944995705
—_I could not leave thee_...	293.4968289266111
—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	784.0033476467655
—No, now, urged Lenehan.	411.1220353678517
_Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There’s no-one.	327.726605884359
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	252.50990299067405
Sudden bent.	130.53040008767556
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
and lost and found it, faltering.	254.28565114614895
—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_
	224.4820391604603
Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	290.9694449287529
Taunted
them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	433.6950039411614
_—Sonnez!_
	137.22421879471196
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.	647.5671101618578
—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan.	622.8004704255711
Trained by owner.	162.3963651425724
No sawdust
there.	219.40669758330077
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	950.4677211386828
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	215.79328009749156
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	502.6386268292019
His spellbound
eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with
sunnier bronze.	574.6857682998581
Yes, bronze from anearby.	326.9702506845002
_Sweetheart, goodbye!_
	123.76145095511502
—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.	251.85889822323816
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	515.3792990613043
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	539.3820803181262
I wanted to tell you.	106.40397956757657
Tom Rochford...	203.15938669399281
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	254.5742057397052
Lenehan gulped to go.	225.56347768008186
—Got the horn or what?	100.15382766966245
I’m coming.	130.91439059244917
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	375.3611286471837
How do?	55.71292897014647
How do?	55.71292897014647
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.	302.58165885711827
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	182.3097625594546
We’ll put a barleystraw in
that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.	259.5163456573361
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
eyelid.	470.03681324591787
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	986.7988821793252
Come on, Simon.	146.0554807867269
Give us a
ditty.	171.1840585498292
We heard the piano.	114.62761352040827
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	763.3681718907517
Power for Richie.	148.84243288685786
And Bloom?	203.15938669399281
Let me see.	74.57324301981852
Not make him walk twice.	217.57564099374264
His corns.	249.72410360095353
Four now.	56.330396450281164
How warm this black is.	168.4746925701491
Course nerves a bit.	149.82575591789507
Refracts (is it?) heat.	109.28995862361859
Let me see.	74.57324301981852
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
Mr Dedalus said.	165.5081573229974
I was only vamping, man.	216.15482239802836
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	283.38879930090246
Begone dull care.	289.34571796462734
Come, Bob.	203.15938669399281
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
hold him now) into the saloon.	344.5295790447148
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	280.0066601110271
His
gouty paws plumped chords.	1209.0202902454212
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	541.7309907398837
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	389.7374486797623
Bothered, he wanted
Power and cider.	227.21964375001446
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	212.4077416764307
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	313.07284964242416
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	210.79777392553368
He’s off.	60.36788623682725
Light sob of breath Bloom
sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	475.8842385135198
He’s gone.	81.13213681790569
—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	448.33494660415727
God be with old times.	113.0399809498432
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight.	457.00739526659515
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	402.7629366588952
She drew down
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar
where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast
inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of
shadow, _eau de Nil._
	652.647351919219
—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
them.	373.070301695136
There was.	32.5875824183266
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	354.208639738199
The devil wouldn’t stop him.	248.24701849271216
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	196.62568539203204
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
punished keyboard.	478.62773482147975
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	472.0671304755521
He had no wed.	178.23158606366755
All trio laughed.	634.3100178961151
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	402.62406408927205
Where’s
my pipe, by the way?	103.0261004616125
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	210.02445338528628
Bald Pat carried
two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	771.7890910111361
And Father Cowley laughed again.	546.3510020446759
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	498.95569468499474
—You did, averred Ben Dollard.	723.8455993870032
I remember those tight trousers too.	310.5073838168006
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	259.1176460020038
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	721.2913536384716
He saved the
situa.	247.12808904943566
Tight trou.	464.672675952932
Brilliant ide.	464.672675952932
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	83.01554329542434
The wife was playing the piano in
the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	209.0026324014837
Do you
remember?	90.02715305543849
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap
in Keogh’s gave us the number.	201.20051667403993
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	566.3332184954422
—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	338.039132877532
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	373.1768569965856
—Merrion square style.	329.25958994432625
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	296.8379472341543
He
wouldn’t take any money either.	301.1930823045787
Any God’s quantity of cocked hats
and boleros and trunkhose.	382.9800621092421
—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	759.2784397838891
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
all descriptions.	378.97930758907717
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	232.68275672231846
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	600.6961079733686
Liver and bacon.	102.95258952404772
Steak and kidney pie.	210.46410389050132
Right, Pat.	203.15938669399281
Mrs Marion.	203.15938669399281
Met him pike hoses.	251.92934959389552
Smell of burn.	121.10479643485958
Of Paul de Kock.	555.3847453302915
Nice
name he.	62.29157890209951
—What’s this her name was?	86.04335586760762
Is she alive?	144.89832739833233
—And kicking.	249.71577004034094
—Daughter of the regiment.	74.53744538846499
—Yes, begad.	365.4416887200119
I remember the old drummajor.	189.78082129701275
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
	1375.486714338064
I don’t know, faith.	193.20025177362663
Is she, Simon?	167.07627106949548
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.	570.0414342357643
O, she is...	53.52941162587551
My Irish
Molly, O.	770.5244035147354
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.	753.6405463249648
—From the rock of Gibraltar...	118.22860818480281
all the way.	40.716667583081936
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
maraschino, thoughtful all two.	427.9671973991476
Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.	787.0451958298258
Pat served, uncovered dishes.	895.8822008447493
Leopold cut liverslices.	467.0119280329052
As said before
he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes
while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then
kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.	758.3803611502333
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.	293.9613026768495
Dinners fit for princes.	269.278509890819
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.	1030.6937152039616
Have you
the?	27.545073559159096
Have you the?	27.545073559159096
Haw haw horn.	556.5158447969292
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
chords:
	1214.9802758079527
—_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	644.8828686701394
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.	417.6981897752559
—War! War! cried Father Cowley.	761.6072905529783
You’re the warrior.	164.23347058501082
—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.	758.4320094689064
Love or
money.	100.99213044611865
He stopped.	132.91603643076527
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	761.4235395062587
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	363.76882263524533
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.	704.9427777469066
He would.	59.025104395069896
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.	664.392332852724
Half time, Ben.	217.54848169656952
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.	441.4278773048839
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.	471.494601122684
She
passed a remark.	156.68438383908855
It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful
weather.	300.20819550205823
They drank cool stout.	508.2911696779745
Did she know where the lord lieutenant
was going?	148.08311481276786
And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring.	732.6728325205006
No, she couldn’t say.	149.91945751307634
O, she need not trouble.	212.86570678099622
No trouble.	134.18194889375738
She
waved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord
lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten.	502.7768626514997
Too much
trouble, first gentleman said.	233.67153559200187
O, not in the least.	63.656818006639426
Way he looked that.	66.81696107833842

for that concert.	210.65178369528047
Trousers tight as a drum on him.	147.30040644671166
Musical porkers.	464.672675952932
Molly did laugh when he went out.	150.7707483567764
Threw herself back across the bed,
screaming, kicking.	370.3186053865591
With all his belongings on show.	150.44889910563361
O saints above,
I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so
many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone.	382.9668199770207
For
instance eunuchs.	542.9807783605025
Wonder who’s playing.	126.69437472177592
Nice touch.	123.26178829205236
Must be Cowley.	178.32828446699574
Knows whatever note you play.	294.76663813174054
Bad breath he has, poor chap.	193.6728161762617
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
Lidwell, gentleman, entering.	1373.014231005944
Good afternoon.	181.7704264911698
She gave her moist (a
lady’s) hand to his firm clasp.	222.8483031703755
Yes, she was back.	73.72340118323915
To the
old dingdong again.	147.38036396052573
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.	576.7484365188916

Bloom ate liv as said before.	312.98263491321677
Clean here at least.	140.08307193683967
That chap in the
Burton, gummy with gristle.	290.5420102279612
No-one here: Goulding and I.	237.42878183585012
Clean tables,
flowers, mitres of napkins.	596.5827536925242

Piano again.	69.07159083352626
Cowley it is.	44.17687065229445
Way he sits in to it, like one together,
mutual understanding.	206.52472283535946
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the
bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache.	622.8767049973895
Her high long snore.	338.33190096854156
Night we were in the box.	92.63199212099806
Trombone under blowing like a grampus,
between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.	619.1504082552175
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy.	620.0334477313438
Do right to hide
them.	137.8967400259064
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.	808.5035366992877
Only the harp.	91.78564947314693

Ben Howth, the rhododendrons.	221.50642679498407
We are their
harps.	211.70893037682967
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.	676.6710134914574
—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled.	498.8946068030763
Get it out in bits.	97.32419924508773
—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.	584.4487018188083
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
arms outheld.	514.7237045608803
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.	244.8470964831086
Softly
he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a
ship, a sail upon the billows.	427.42309735457474
A lovely girl, her veil awave
upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.	331.242521131376
Cowley sang:
	136.8825237855926
_—M’appari tutt’amor:
Il mio sguardo l’incontr..._
	2071.4386853211545
She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
wind, love, speeding sail, return.	601.2973483821762
—Go on, Simon.	146.0554807867269
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben...	396.44302892663535
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
touched the obedient keys.	357.5235586956863
Play it in the original.	61.274425623089535
One flat.	152.27515942925112
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.	1309.5114024283923
—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said.	308.73235911395034
Get up.	45.161717238889764
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.	789.7727304704661
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
and Goulding.	712.0525308444977
Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.	288.41277408860145
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
heard Joe Maas sing that one night.	577.3915937528003
Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes.	539.5887627124409
In his way.	61.121889312960825
Choirboy style.	177.74687135640693
Maas was the boy.	58.40031297090201
A lyrical tenor if you like.	338.77116431719554
Never forget it.	102.34208596977382
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.	715.6991872932851
Backache he.	25.706179759234487
Bright’s bright eye.	150.25654654320013
Next item on the programme.	191.74921238817564
Paying
the piper.	99.28325517640305
Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.	421.57364201561916

Best value in.	113.0284449042383
Characteristic of him.	33.590752399471135
Particular about his drink.	106.27499231644065
Flaw in the
glass, fresh Vartry water.	212.59360967138667
Fecking matches from counters to save.	340.53437771532106
Then
squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.	354.67405455055723
And when he’s wanted not a
farthing.	129.08956484655937
Screwed refusing to pay his fare.	274.5566529130816
Curious types.	287.40150812754337
Never would Richie forget that night.	249.35650343790417
As long as he lived: never.	147.88483105406138
In
the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.	152.4278787888083
And when the first note.	115.2017816696052
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.	286.5887057588494
Coming out with a whopper now.	134.80693484034995
Rhapsodies about damn all.	132.72260621979035
Believes his
own lies.	143.03857998948362
Wonderful liar.	266.0083962612288
But want a good memory.	145.59680665759987
—Which air is that?	83.22925831092948
asked Leopold Bloom.	494.0867752080217
—_All is lost now_.	253.00609631189067
Richie cocked his lips apout.	379.67205707997095
A low incipient note sweet banshee
murmured: all.	739.9662414722674
A thrush.	317.52287348145126
A throstle.	287.39671252413314
His breath, birdsweet, good teeth
he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe.	433.2365610830774
Is lost.	98.83158871308555
Rich sound.	150.21429608575608
Two
notes in one there.	124.85817460463919
Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.	310.88665418342663
Taking my
motives he twined and turned them.	224.9884279213505
All most too new call is lost in
all.	166.51325879447552
How sweet the answer.	117.65033284079145
How is that done?	88.09581481095262
All lost now.	129.48858253961012
Mournful he whistled.	166.00775293431013
Fall, surrender, lost.	450.6564038391862
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.	370.52280737071715
Yes, I remember.	316.260267234867
Lovely air.	89.68900373598827
In sleep she went to him.	116.57566860087242
Innocence
in the moon.	54.136652193404736
Don’t know their danger.	193.57297840633214
Still hold her back.	130.13961597981367
Call
name.	71.84248504265817
Touch water.	88.13372890005441
Jingle jaunty.	287.39671252413314
Too late.	126.18097476849964
She longed to go.	200.03420227911914
That’s
why.	69.90675123651354
As easy stop the sea.	182.48422061922287
Yes: all is lost.	96.25266290211663
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.	486.7555217928127
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.	186.43583072279964
He knows it well too.	138.50173948973207
Still harping on his daughter.	204.96251457520697
Wise
child that knows her father, Dedalus said.	213.24725832712943
Bloom askance over liverless saw.	519.5298424120465
Face of the all is lost.	59.65380780877224
Rollicking
Richie once.	280.0044540891873
Jokes old stale now.	200.23178596367774
Wagging his ear.	86.37143076711561
Napkinring in his
eye.	61.7813303643689
Now begging letters he sends his son with.	262.04329396412743
Crosseyed Walter sir I
did sir.	395.91493327214454
Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money.	380.25791602451784
Piano again.	69.07159083352626
Sounds better than last time I heard.	332.9699026246825
Tuned probably.	135.4939018501051
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	259.46550334655393
—With it, Simon.	140.3907322034375
—It, Simon.	203.15938669399281
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
solicitations.	488.8395418141815
—It, Simon.	203.15938669399281
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	253.7139380151596
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	402.50090618896616
The harping chords of prelude closed.	582.4001222830099
A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
drew a voice away.	628.4876567015988
—_When first I saw that form endearing_...	403.11709083490643
Richie turned.	85.09382951480983
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.	150.2620468711827
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	719.3760677171323
Bloom signed to
Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the
bar.	261.7480478167555
The door of the bar.	79.02509230798924
That will do.	92.39225287922123
Pat, waiter, waited,
waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	167.09223660313998
—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._
	170.91286259298613
Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem
dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their
each his remembered lives.	338.6143470005604
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	265.4765855253589
When first they saw,
lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect
it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	372.2335897693221
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.	195.80518250958139
Bloom unwound slowly the
elastic band of his packet.	358.9578543003383
Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	403.5998502060434
Bloom
wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	618.9452026166504
—_Full of hope and all delighted_...	138.2904219607139
Tenors get women by the score.	159.32607396835547
Increase their flow.	160.92043928172455
Throw flower at his
feet.	138.7053312300833
When will we meet?	167.3414287927016
My head it simply.	125.6882358475456
Jingle all delighted.	179.1508476557688
He
can’t sing for tall hats.	279.6023743712691
Your head it simply swurls.	245.63350315009424
Perfumed for him.	46.851937621378404
What perfume does your wife?	262.1514054326227
I want to know.	91.24992067098948
Last
look at mirror always before she answers the door.	217.65070433671332
The hall.	127.2014629412334
How
do you?	60.930362284952714
I do well.	98.89783200767285
Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,
in her satchel.	378.926461313027
Hands felt for the opulent.	132.61446991796993
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	491.40918035536697
—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...	1240.7766954869671
Glorious tone he has still.	159.3016554883194
Cork air softer also their brogue.	511.6477494267481
Silly
man! Could have made oceans of money.	297.5476444227691
Singing wrong words.	211.1628313418802
Wore out his
wife: now sings.	169.951385843334
But hard to tell.	117.0147629171451
If he
doesn’t break down.	192.92898336011493
Keep a trot for the avenue.	131.45111437484272
His hands and feet sing
too.	182.88888464022358
Nerves overstrung.	464.672675952932
Must be abstemious to sing.	233.61548852478
Jenny Lind
soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream.	833.1885284405005
For creamy dreamy.	665.6809560834968
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed.	520.7027601070179
That’s the
chat.	89.26387303075698
Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.	615.9110370936487
No: it’s what’s behind.	76.92083237427423
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.	2098.9839981820705
Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music
out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading.	535.9817822487292
Tipping her tepping her
tapping her topping her.	309.9755153321696
Pores to dilate dilating.	400.3408924377704
The joy
the feel the warm the.	100.71397663908458
To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes.	1006.746354015148
Now! Language of love.	148.96540721643626
_ray of hope is_...	205.69955675365102
Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse
unsqueaked a ray of hopk.	577.5439322271664
_Martha_ it is.	44.17687065229445
Just going to write.	110.744792066179
Lionel’s song.	103.47778088782168
Lovely
name you have.	88.13351532423358
Can’t write.	128.4897273386476
Accept my little pres.	223.02520049283663
Play on her
heartstrings pursestrings too.	303.7412260741914
She’s a.	30.978450567811755
I called you naughty boy.	228.5803337204931
Still
the name: Martha.	125.7385323043734
How strange! Today.	404.03590466386964
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.	576.6199897866982
It sang again to
Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to
wait.	530.6918962599894
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,
how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.	487.19401810772285
Wish I could see his face, though.	210.05852758427176
Explain better.	85.52706137596047
Why the barber in
Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.	211.4293815389779
Still
hear it better here than in the bar though farther.	194.52596266652176
—_Each graceful look_...	824.7533730312146
First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure.	307.2740412156065
Yellow,
black lace she wore.	312.2370124120304
Musical chairs.	216.97884341188544
We two the last.	68.34291271723083
After her.	34.64317786172705

—_Charmed my eye_...	263.89032335881024
_Waiting_ she sang.	127.42296114967954
I turned her music.	145.93807677898226
Full voice of perfume
of what perfume does your lilactrees.	249.41065905457086

She thanked me.	201.68422932861066
Why did she me?	83.97056674653061
Spanishy

Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant
to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony.	385.0112406222809
In
cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel.	347.58114070630637

Lydia, admired,

But Bloom sang dumb.	720.0681356994149
Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice.	333.3619983210342
He remembered
one night long ago.	260.5739152452329
Never forget that night.	135.1233976231779
Si sang _’Twas rank and
fame_: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas.	448.01328736394834
Good God he never heard in all his life
a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so
clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice
lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.	344.8141871217744
Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang _’Twas rank and fame._
	374.5176269475245
Brothers-in-law: relations.	203.36781548857874

Rift in the
lute I think.	191.8170286561393

He admires him all the more.	137.86703646099284
The night Si sang.	371.1131829807008
The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,
more than all others.	514.3044719836558
That voice was a lamentation.	157.37497743391648
Calmer now.	56.330396450281164
Now silent air.	203.83380745025448
Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the
slender catgut thong.	588.397975885076
He drew and plucked.	206.7827029903433
It buzz, it twanged.	348.17300571585884
While
Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan,
harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening
Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played.	534.9342314815777
While
big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he
smoked, who smoked.	721.8315733003615
Thou lost one.	114.98271881041363
All songs on that theme.	243.2337808552107
Yet more Bloom stretched his
string.	447.9337948783281
Cruel it seems.	100.14898836472902

—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.	272.5635927626721
George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.	245.13229962023956
First gentleman told Mina that was so.	193.82115324262685
She asked him was that so.	87.17219336087591
And

With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch’s

At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave (her heaving
embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose.	814.3558138353969
Heartbeats: her breath:
breath that is life.	153.14224501946697
And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of

Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.	767.8713485864479
All lost in pity for croppy.	215.63845749007135
Fro, to: to, fro: over the
polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and
finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid
so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding
through their sliding ring.	412.42004564326214

At Geneva barrack that young man died.	448.8496044247537

Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to
dolorous prayer.	488.8741614735466
By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,
by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze
and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so
lonely Bloom.	569.6708706856206
Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard.	169.86969396425135
You who hear in peace.	157.31021056685196
Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people.	271.9672254527046

Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with.	257.0579719013579

Six bob.	108.7635306310704

Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking

Robert
Emmet’s last words.	224.54607210951224
Seven last words.	147.2839057387678
Of Meyerbeer that is.	124.79714326538486
—True men like you men.	129.58936206503293
—Ay, ay, Ben.	342.73298504914084
—Will lift your glass with us.	234.09220033294284
They lifted.	132.9359939155301
An unseeing stripling stood in the door.	230.91312409958516
He saw not bronze.	172.94335129890325
He saw

	29.735702233990914
I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.	136.21137831683453
I turned around to let him have
the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony
Batter only Joe Hynes.	393.67877955415554
—Lo, Joe, says I.	400.79936811672553
How are you blowing?	143.13700053287272
Did you see that bloody
chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	263.24631636490085
—Soot’s luck, says Joe.	238.2551873201339
Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?	124.59736525714882
—Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	202.16649607603827
—What are you doing round those parts?	220.9622426367268
—Devil a much, says I.	168.09579724819216
There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving
me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to
pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
street.	284.25124537742477
—Ay, says I.	206.69219148679485
A bit off the top.	124.68842396435299
An old plumber named Geraghty.	625.3759707601973
I’m
hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a
penny out of him.	180.52565242018193
—That the lay you’re on now?	100.9247760831069
—Ay, says I.	206.69219148679485
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful
debts.	332.14077734702965
But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a
day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of
rain.	192.12898579849266
_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him
summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst.	275.982094367352
Jesus,
I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	233.63362999773358
_He drink me
my teas.	240.77840992469123
He eat me my sugars.	286.1431817693435
Because he no pay me my moneys?_

—Are you a strict t.t.?	123.88217787379511
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	502.84588513017104
—What about paying our respects to our friend?	297.4972991871871
Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.	141.11447240452145
—Drinking his own stuff?	143.95295002655774
—Ay, says I.	206.69219148679485
Whisky and water on the brain.	93.54125342014713
—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe.	339.6753674787239
I want to see the citizen.	86.19679202395236
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I.	257.9734243282997
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	423.56060575787745
—Not a word, says Joe.	169.88515940278484
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	155.52433061317984
—What was that, Joe?	117.7086484191082
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	275.43104373856545
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
courthouse talking of one thing or another.	175.2877133142891
Decent fellow Joe when he
has it but sure like that he never has it.	156.01672404655565
Jesus, I couldn’t get over
that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	463.81250593359164
For trading without a
licence, says he.	229.41194869448665
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	219.86311424014065
There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	391.75549761279007
There sleep the mighty dead as
in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	317.47641978085363
A pleasant
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated.	442.6359428379431
In the mild breezes of the west and of the
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	404.97330543196625
Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing
the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects
as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts
of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful
insects.	571.3839063361805
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to
Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht
the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of
Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the
sons of kings.	293.9062006498789
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
descended from chieftains.	548.0914968930974
Thither the extremely large wains bring
foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets
of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and
red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples
and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and
pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their
canes.	664.3905468482371
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	243.27101204402808
Come out here, Geraghty, you
notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
	500.3690897382249
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance
of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins
and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great
hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	500.63833965926017
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
drop in the way of drink.	203.5200363807611
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
load of papers, working for the cause.	226.465182415785
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	205.65548476406303
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that
bloody dog.	196.6102953022896
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off
a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
about a licence.	191.70585668825944
—Stand and deliver, says he.	111.43430141199319
—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.	193.57032433312278
Friends here.	64.56289892777333
—Pass, friends, says he.	117.72526031678917
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
	98.07699114265968
—What’s your opinion of the times?	105.94614721711332
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	145.2442560666833
But, begob, Joe was equal to
the occasion.	252.7443109563185
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
fork.	198.02311045061822
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
	179.83967867030796
—Foreign wars is the cause of it.	118.9698093097668
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
	239.87297932570797
—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	208.66729124361765
—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	489.3064966048997
I’ve a thirst on me
I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.	297.0229168867756
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	171.98462026318654
—Wine of the country, says he.	60.68359670503475
—What’s yours?	115.64066505172929
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	622.3302954444845
And how’s the old heart, citizen?	117.57552784065702
says
he.	25.478264492909325
—Never better, _a chara_, says he.	313.16747740933084
What Garry?	203.15938669399281
Are we going to win?	154.0396530573474
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	163.72430419884975
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
hero.	872.0534525366731
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	456.790486302077
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	523.593980308989
The eyes in
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	201.80082954210266
A powerful current of warm
breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his
mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations
of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the
summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to
vibrate and tremble.	437.68756296741793
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	358.2518848512106
His nether extremities were
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast.	562.985178514707
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled
at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with
rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and
heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine
hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane
O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh
O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael
Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley,
Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain
Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	1178.9918977448665
Fursa, S.	203.15938669399281
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone,
the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of
Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn’t, Benjamin Franklin,
Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	622.2494447465942
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish,
Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell,

Philip O’Sullivan Beare.	1291.1006877070267
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested
by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe
whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which
his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a
mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	565.0764554650684
O, as true as
I’m telling you.	239.43106318808134
A goodlooking sovereign.	517.5413236330644
—And there’s more where that came from, says he.	110.15409095230295
—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	352.16170243745154
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	195.6594075021551
’Twas the prudent member gave me the
wheeze.	233.01269772966796
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	306.53252790855885
Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour?	535.9187216877264
O’Bloom, the
son of Rory: it is he.	129.0119309221503
Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the
prudent soul.	164.0898968960568
—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised
organ.	162.58409974679893
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	158.82373676867445
And look at
this blasted rag, says he.	243.87178573028982
Look at this, says he.	78.43987513525617
_The Irish
Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s
friend.	287.4105353084902
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland
Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.	201.59041248332372
And he starts reading them out:
	165.19527469567157
—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s
on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	459.6652171144976
How’s that, eh?	83.92379709165694
Wright
and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
dean of Worcester.	571.64043821141
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:
Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the
Moat house, Chepstow...	607.5405821704217
—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	331.8720229835571
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	908.856321857359
How’s that for a national press, eh, my
brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	319.01545519831853
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	370.48293197318566
Thanks be to God they had
the start of us.	130.53780656541224
Drink that, citizen.	82.25132154289903
—I will, says he, honourable person.	189.09706108705893
—Health, Joe, says I.	400.79936811672553
And all down the form.	85.30491068918265
Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	296.2446323112653
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	267.270679384064
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
fairest of her race.	322.0416290469693
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s
snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	330.9348669347869
And who was sitting up there in
the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
Doran.	285.14014161836775
I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
door.	196.83174703755694
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter
and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting
like a poodle.	393.1347526660153
I thought Alf would split.	430.0348417239696
—Look at him, says he.	67.09236695150167
He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a
postcard someone sent him with U.	306.1121851907668
p: up on it to take a li...	111.62915569008827
And he doubled up.	135.83371726887464
—Take a what?	39.81685055244747
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	258.83164539790897
—O hell! says I.	307.47650388052165
_—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.	310.21864856196714
—Breen, says Alf.	206.69219148679485
He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round
to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round
to the subsheriff’s for a lark.	205.57778660231952
O God, I’ve a pain laughing.	533.5666970040947
p: up.	44.5676377971097
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody
old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	210.09798950867818
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	242.32817574061474
—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	514.9832818501636
Is that Alf Bergan?	294.67308089767585
—Yes, says Alf.	206.69219148679485
Wait till I show you.	261.26447701585755
Here, Terry, give us a
pony.	324.2581065292886
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	529.4776040597313
You should have seen
long John’s eye.	278.67042093055187
And he started laughing.	191.8088340813282
—Who are you laughing at?	112.53782154638039
says Bob Doran.	494.0867752080217
Is that Bergan?	137.15405456813983
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	369.42454928006964
Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full
of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
deathless Leda.	497.5371288337245
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	339.1594850539342
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	287.01054671208414
But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a
testoon of costliest bronze.	390.1695459578378
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork
was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of
Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of
God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress
of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the
wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to
the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	303.1153950544266
—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
down outside?	230.06440236062215
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
Talking about hanging,
I’ll show you something you never saw.	285.25588222051414
Hangmen’s letters.	99.97131419590256
Look at here.	75.98382578491346
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his
pocket.	161.19208141255282
—Are you codding?	195.34605217246676
—Honest injun, says Alf.	537.3269741599461
Read them.	48.58276040143106
So Joe took up the letters.	194.2674679869455
—Who are you laughing at?	112.53782154638039
says Bob Doran.	494.0867752080217
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	138.9830678198858
Bob’s a queer chap when
the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:
	172.82008284330752
—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	460.8955463016869
—I don’t know, says Alf.	220.43171474948352
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
Dignam.	282.02878998484033
Only I was running after that...	191.41977896383236
—You what?	42.76162057125033
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	281.01223336951836
With who?	53.101614489396674
—With Dignam, says Alf.	400.79936811672553
—Is it Paddy?	140.3907322034375
—Yes, says Alf.	206.69219148679485
—Don’t you know he’s dead?	91.71227556063867
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	425.65352537649284
—Ay, says Joe.	206.69219148679485
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
a pikestaff.	392.7601834695106
—Who’s dead?	76.44241857724501
says Bob Doran.	494.0867752080217
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
Good Christ, only five...	306.8243739341611
And Willy Murray
with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s...	188.65961562491717
Dignam
dead?	87.62856066913204
—What about Dignam?	200.29045675767188
says Bob Doran.	494.0867752080217
Who’s talking about...?	108.09846548697178
—Dead! says Alf.	206.69219148679485
He’s no more dead than you are.	134.56242449144614
—Maybe so, says Joe.	198.65487115034455
They took the liberty of burying him this morning
anyhow.	229.47124227005173
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
—Ay, says Joe.	206.69219148679485
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	244.27453383443208
—Good Christ! says Alf.	400.79936811672553
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	163.7343238848906
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	353.7273669264898
Communication was
effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the
orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar
plexus.	371.49720418638157
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the
heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return
but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty
entities on the lower astral levels.	249.62187491595043
In reply to a question as to his
first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously
he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	260.93165210278215
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the
spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort
such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	361.01340840249526
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
afforded relief.	410.67400827219535
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted
all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true
path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were
out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	275.3437610031888
It was
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are
still in the body.	230.9544347425139
Mind C.	203.15938669399281
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained
that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	391.089199555637
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the
defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment
arrangements.	301.0634856807444
Before departing he requested that it should be told to
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for
was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair
should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still
good.	208.96716233764676
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in
the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made
known.	299.25386175055814
He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning.	429.8855181934811
Fleet was
his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	204.85351883570084
Wail, Banba, with
your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	429.68026034390766
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	122.26214755287216
—Bloom, says he.	51.809446218198566
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten
minutes.	162.24728609018783
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	318.1397702898372
Faith, he was.	35.441684332301406
—Good Christ! says he.	141.98441890484816
I could have sworn it was him.	146.82277536016022
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:
	205.68652675068768
—Who said Christ is good?	165.726302798368
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	536.0832685678151
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
Dignam?	364.623366812174
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	229.69286366134872
He’s over all his troubles.	120.74414012041116
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	269.7290481400379
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	345.7701780930575
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	229.44429308043317
And Bob
Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.	468.9224245471773
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	406.4281153476364
Talking through his bloody hat.	146.21659357547261
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	296.6293715200077
—The noblest, the truest, says he.	200.65848740837606
And he’s gone, poor little Willy,
poor little Paddy Dignam.	342.0186700624626
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
the door.	361.57828649213974
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.	118.14283008352055
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
Martin Cunningham there.	283.50141639461924
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	376.7399867963409
Listen to
this, will you?	74.46470889365
And he starts reading out one.	163.52436941986406
_7 Hunter Street,
Liverpool._
	466.39385676175857
_To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
	242.122544597213
Dublin._
	29.735702233990914
_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
hanged..._
	363.6055157055179
—Show us, Joe, says I.	385.54276363125365
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._
	387.512251513715
—Jesus, says I.	206.69219148679485
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._
	492.57042598985976
The citizen made a grab at the letter.	168.68742438739756
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
terms is five ginnees._
	355.48991200152335
Master Barber._
	137.22421879471196
—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	200.5689204253252
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	231.25316763531157
Here, says he, take them
to hell out of my sight, Alf.	173.4604176212379
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you
have?	140.88354373232835
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and
he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said
well he’d just take a cigar.	186.96660549608015
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.	165.7563871659761
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	412.01042105993514
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with
a black border round it.	237.63214526314488
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	309.0548886560255
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his
heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	231.51109474115458
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	244.57687748959208
Their
deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
saith the Lord.	590.0804507766238
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those
jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about
I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	228.31510221119822
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	260.20623337821735
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.	365.13143279916295
—That so?	50.1242710750977
—God’s truth, says Alf.	239.00906291777488
I heard that from the head warder that was in
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	265.1840453378755
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	325.364007244209
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	354.24847262204986
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science
and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	194.19850912536734
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
	516.9142783078823
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe
with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported
for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,
that and the other.	171.46121892045625
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a
new dog so he ought.	179.56484594523528
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all
round the place and scratching his scabs.	404.7715687529093
And round he goes to Bob
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could
get.	230.38404605308045
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
	265.04071146659277
—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
here! Give us the paw!
	458.7041375848599
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	299.5053909084256
Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to
bring.	235.1008124022056
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more.	175.83598059891088
Near ate the tin and all, hungry
bloody mongrel.	287.50169673151373
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
she’s far from the land.	327.48542911572684
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	335.98681170554545
Phenomenon! The fat heap he
married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	228.51230210279954
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me
there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating
meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and
taking the lout out for a walk.	221.15639562665896
And one time he led him the rounds of
Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought
him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him
the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near
roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd
that kept the hotel.	233.92808824698466
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them
off chewing the fat.	343.05615583409076
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but
on the other hand_.	197.1317646774313
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in
Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
samples in the bloody establishment.	275.7748974142244
—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
glaring at Bloom.	209.02789463495384
—Ay, ay, says Joe.	303.3787122314264
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.	359.2076038347831
What I mean is...	236.97282707075811
—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen.	122.79469010198964
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	360.9187250165838
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	232.7626515095981
The deafening
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	468.10333080072365
A torrential rain
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared
heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest
computation five hundred thousand persons.	468.63433160823644
A posse of Dublin
Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.	572.5477462159696
Special quick excursion trains
and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	453.4455228904585
Considerable
amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
mirth-provoking fashion.	826.901856740503
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will
grudge them their hardearned pennies.	484.77872348756006
The children of the Male and
Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the
scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s
entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the
Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and
motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	339.77115244266935
The viceregal
houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their
Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while
the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald
Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	519.4764608479796
The delegation,
present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone

All the
delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
they had been called upon to witness.	464.51528356280386
An animated altercation (in which
all took part) ensued among the F.	424.3857864686195
as to whether the eighth
or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s
patron saint.	221.59853023684047
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
and blows were freely exchanged.	887.8524773923178
The baby policeman, Constable
MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
parties.	670.5092077618511
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to
all and was unanimously accepted.	413.59227413250426
Constable MacFadden was heartily
congratulated by all the F.	315.9812132457256
I., several of whom were bleeding
profusely.	393.54810947053284
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
senses.	369.683213813901
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and
gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	623.4260893210909
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
Cruentus_.	424.4302447539509
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking
yet withal so characteristic of the man.	473.38866295868763
The arrival of the
worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani
beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	627.2649042995167
It
was exactly seventeen o’clock.	343.90242203625616
The signal for prayer was then promptly
given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the
commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession
of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his
medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	371.21119799871127
The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	360.69023533589615
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested
the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	382.1491029510277
On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering
knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially
supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and
Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
precious blood of the most precious victim.	695.3282314636762
The housesteward of the
amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	458.8432011312716
Quite an
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and
onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and
invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for
the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital
spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying
wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in
aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’
association as a token of his regard and esteem.	376.11560286099433
The _nec_ and _non
plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into
eternity for her sake.	373.765247593324
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving
embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	746.5211164462322
Encouraged by this use of
her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
ardour to reach.	364.9513870745315
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would
never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips
as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	238.16137212539437
She
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
pastor, joining in the general merriment.	323.8385538152357
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
their hands for the last time.	247.17675994666
A fresh torrent of tears burst from
their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being
the aged prebendary himself.	502.616553841638
Big strong men, officers of the peace and
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
in that record assemblage.	282.6188310879285
A most romantic incident occurred when a
handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and
genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	421.0996116360762
Every
lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the
occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and
generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most
timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his
blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in
the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	292.55489011894605
Nay,
even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had
blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	546.6600070795588
With his mailed
gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
	362.1613203981108
—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	450.3151972661939
Blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	344.5744114590678
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he
cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	255.26889128516825
Antitreating is
about the size of it.	79.05754515481892
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down
his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth
of his pint.	225.88415753085042
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and
oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
entertainment, don’t be talking.	318.26788342816735
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	387.09181893627255
And
then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	250.61143691012353
And one or two
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
females, hitting below the belt.	314.52440082634473
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me.	371.4190053021773
I’d train him by kindness, so I
would, if he was my dog.	249.65224141956557
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
where it wouldn’t blind him.	222.3071882189194
—Afraid he’ll bite you?	132.0858905831173
says the citizen, jeering.	142.38318833719353
—No, says I.	206.69219148679485
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	191.6732005504522
So he calls the old dog over.	121.1240869467063
—What’s on you, Garry?	107.72388925914072
says he.	25.478264492909325
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	223.63455339779534
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	222.2942583644585
Someone
that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono
publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of
that.	208.08136734846806
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth
is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	171.1117805072766
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_
of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends
and acquaintances Owen Garry.	408.70628816423675
The exhibition, which is the result of
years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary
system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	420.8674591863669
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with
which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym
of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but
rather (as a contributor D.	405.75734727853165
points out in an interesting
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	287.9440027351722
We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar
whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we
believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more
than an indication.	429.2854274663649
The metrical system of the canine original, which
recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh
englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will
agree that the spirit has been well caught.	502.9527483774738
Perhaps it should be added
that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat
slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	404.4884122512258
The curse of my curses
	235.19106591993972
Seven days every day
	197.67085506396964
And seven dry Thursdays
	535.611131295286
On you, Barney Kiernan,
	309.89583267231285
Has no sup of water
	198.286278958048
To cool my courage,
	312.0513733580507
And my guts red roaring
	379.5371765982028
After Lowry’s lights.	263.83952346418596
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off.	210.68500165270189
And Joe asked him would he have
another.	187.24635986675128
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.	254.3072446654896
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.	121.50222697530708
Arsing around from one
pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	271.307844159769
Entertainment for
man and beast.	112.91847331590796
And says Joe:
	206.69219148679485
—Could you make a hole in another pint?	175.06715312775722
—Could a swim duck?	248.3898217684419
—Same again, Terry, says Joe.	387.48357100098866
Are you sure you won’t have anything in
the way of liquid refreshment?	183.57165712777257
says he.	25.478264492909325
—Thank you, no, says Bloom.	161.40643601053827
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor
Dignam’s.	287.3195442146955
Martin asked me to go to the house.	83.7768427212345
You see, he, Dignam, I
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the
policy.	255.54073420235378
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is
landed.	274.1206479587708
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	193.28948081724928
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.	148.77360953911915
—Whose admirers?	266.0083962612288
—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	489.6904235194851
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in
himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
friend in court.	194.96181218881333
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
Hungarian privileged lottery.	468.89730353940774
True as you’re there.	92.5309106771186
O, commend me to an
israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	648.5480015498201
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.	239.3419947747341
Choking with bloody foolery.	245.05723887790876
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic
to tell her that.	221.63054424445392
Shake hands, brother.	175.63249395954688
You’re a rogue and I’m another.	250.0038267213141
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to
request of you this favour.	330.401345041577
But, should I have overstepped the limits
of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my
boldness.	319.7155531032697
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
of the cup.	315.970698164452
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	148.33022444296864
The goodness of your heart,
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech.	434.1982670610684
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	145.05774202259366
Boosed at five
o’clock.	179.71974378312632
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
bobby, 14A.	433.97573649401005
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,
drinking porter out of teacups.	277.57464915512435
And calling himself a Frenchy for the
shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he
serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut,
who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and
smugging.	274.28308860318754
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed
and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	212.04864971263956
_How is your
testament?	185.27055291192576
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing
there, I tell you what.	295.57519025502046
Then see him of a Sunday with his little
concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as
pie, doing the little lady.	199.74875119736663
Jack Mooney’s sister.	233.27690812699566
And the old
prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	250.3361464276699
Gob, Jack
made him toe the line.	255.55798188630862
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus,
he’d kick the shite out of him.	200.34802469727305
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	294.8552819516244
Here, citizen.	95.12188758851237
—_Slan leat_, says he.	214.63091418819513
—Fortune, Joe, says I.	400.79936811672553
Good health, citizen.	261.21703751715256
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	182.45022450175634
Want a small
fortune to keep him in drinks.	193.72832939455708
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	205.34567766710148
—Friend of yours, says Alf.	213.4340437185259
The mimber?	464.672675952932
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.	432.34920708886887
—I thought so, says Joe.	244.35335349664663
I saw him up at that meeting now with William
Field, M.	283.2377204803196
P., the cattle traders.	192.5222282799445
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
all countries and the idol of his own.	196.48475265866878
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	260.3877329590407
Because he was up one time in a
knacker’s yard.	132.7538022344533
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head
and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
for giving lip to a grazier.	231.91597378480057
Mister Knowall.	203.15938669399281
Teach your grandmother how
to milk ducks.	348.1891159892
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out
with her eight inches of fat all over her.	251.01311253433022
Couldn’t loosen her farting
strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
it.	319.03763061512984
What’s your programme today?	202.8307554301815
Humane methods.	266.0083962612288
Because the poor
animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t
cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	292.6606112843709
Gob,
he’d have a soft hand under a hen.	169.37912844637543
Ga Ga Gara.	494.0867752080217
Klook Klook Klook.	494.0867752080217
Black Liz is our hen.	353.89611368448817
She lays eggs for
us.	315.90924072195133
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	247.060609018562
Klook Klook Klook.	494.0867752080217
Then
comes good uncle Leo.	456.62351329608924
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
fresh egg.	333.7170746200675
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	1065.2966454398065
Klook Klook Klook.	494.0867752080217
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	210.50855090855947
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	207.22853395814593
I wanted to see
him, as it happens.	149.01962087081137
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	204.94636501943558
—That’s too bad, says Bloom.	206.57213618501297
I wanted particularly.	297.3973277654076
Perhaps only Mr
Field is going.	336.47392602464396
I couldn’t phone.	310.82393653323356
You’re sure?	171.57904966849316
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.	188.68501834587795
The league told him to ask a question
tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
park.	322.5783388909563
What do you think of that, citizen?	100.44961179584173
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.	934.5287135464007
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	770.5244035147354
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that
these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is
forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	403.934009144829
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	494.0867752080217
Con.): Honourable members are already in
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
house.	258.45762736988763
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	526.4027008456535
The answer to the
honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.	176.93472225516408
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.	1005.9497775117529
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
Phoenix park?	474.9653976541894
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	262.1558206257162
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
bench?	471.6223263891373
(O! O!)
	203.15938669399281
Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	299.7941010204739
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	494.0867752080217
Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.	400.4101913851083
(Ironical opposition cheers.)
	699.5280257275507
The speaker: Order! Order!
	963.3105787097486
(The house rises.	238.6736608981511
—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	246.06831921250216
There
he is sitting there.	95.51970511324778
The man that got away James Stephens.	309.1530114628734
The champion
of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	352.2510144249773
What was your best
throw, citizen?	211.32235295773248
—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	244.7542645783108
There was a
time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	157.32035105269406
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	194.96692426453754
You were and a bloody sight better.	139.83333196991472
—Is that really a fact?	118.73162968874584
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
—Yes, says Bloom.	206.69219148679485
That’s well known.	134.22020350972633
Did you not know that?	75.21920476460504
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
and building up a nation once again and all to that.	244.7823223559401
And of course
Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart
violent exercise was bad.	211.74761655646077
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	231.38900486294403
Do you see that straw?	117.32964515313121
That’s a straw_.	117.24061467099973
Declare to my aunt he’d talk
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	191.79117039777668
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	458.2109877260218
The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions.	199.49995979621093
After an instructive discourse by
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
forefathers.	386.45396797569794
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
ages.	494.5682281700655
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	497.3370639537633
The Irish
Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were
heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only
our citizen can sing it.	376.6095028556036
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its
superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was
vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be
noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives
of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	442.30435709839617
The
proceedings then terminated.	535.3991239928914

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
Keogh-Bennett match?	447.29918177823777
—No, says Joe.	206.69219148679485
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	361.6294842121751
And says Bloom:
	206.69219148679485
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
the eye.	299.1554002157716
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	400.79936811672553
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
the odds and he swatting all the time.	152.55876354964803
—We know him, says the citizen.	88.61708079252138
The traitor’s son.	238.50416488066236
We know what put
English gold in his pocket.	195.09368492371718
—True for you, says Joe.	138.95307600727264
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
blood, asking Alf:
	324.1771432127163
—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?	202.75964608758608
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	246.4091433113237
Heenan and Sayers was only
a bloody fool to it.	136.24283969159978
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	87.25161924944386
See
the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	182.4024376075461
God,
he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
him puke what he never ate.	234.1573666957467
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	283.22552740899664
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up
for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	334.5852818730562
The final bout of fireworks
was a gruelling for both champions.	416.08871946999477
The welterweight sergeantmajor had
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had
been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in
some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	494.2773956517696
The
soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which
the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the
point of Bennett’s jaw.	351.7373770239644
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him
with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	299.8712041376602
The men came to
handigrips.	232.62942373208185
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout
ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	348.45640461403104
The
Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he
was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey
and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in
jigtime.	378.7890040292913
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	97.37669837910948
The two
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	530.970930243457
The referee twice
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
footwork a treat to watch.	451.97865089907305
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him
flat.	366.2591595207034
It was a knockout clean and clever.	209.8739555501023
Amid tense expectation the
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	425.1996477002542
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	317.6458804399073
I hear he’s
running a concert tour now up in the north.	161.13998588761174
—He is, says Joe.	171.28679857079734
Isn’t he?	48.059065995079436
says Bloom.	203.15938669399281
Ah, yes.	60.45787357664621
That’s quite true.	148.71812554478555
Yes, a kind of summer
tour, you see.	152.3859632549391
—Mrs B.	203.15938669399281
is the bright particular star, isn’t she?	254.40711152749228
—My wife?	84.00345988435129
says Bloom.	203.15938669399281
She’s singing, yes.	128.78123649479517
I think it will be a success
too.	152.80461792431626
He’s an excellent man to organise.	203.04789544844604
Hoho begob says I to myself says I.	378.5401156818795
That explains the milk in the
cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest.	186.86555016432735
Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off
Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to
fight the Boers.	282.6461328750246
Old Whatwhat.	203.15938669399281
I called about the poor and water rate,
Mr Boylan.	290.09914385134755
You what?	42.76162057125033
The water rate, Mr Boylan.	693.6477525423052
You whatwhat?	365.4355909322164
That’s
the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip.	236.91356243861128
Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy.	333.7796448885571
There
grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air.	384.84048493149766
The
gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.	318.3957922769015
The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.	403.88718205928126
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned
in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
Lambert.	254.2323555742891
—Hello, Ned.	203.15938669399281
—Hello, Alf.	203.15938669399281
—Hello, Jack.	203.15938669399281
—Hello, Joe.	203.15938669399281
—God save you, says the citizen.	109.89005480124023
—Save you kindly, says J.	283.1946915946251
What’ll it be, Ned?	168.30401025949706
—Half one, says Ned.	192.6360997699471
So J.	203.15938669399281
ordered the drinks.	93.5162634301646
—Were you round at the court?	91.8122656326516
He’ll square that, Ned, says he.	194.77105842580832
—Hope so, says Ned.	198.65487115034455
Now what were those two at?	117.26910678834008
getting him off the grand jury list
and the other give him a leg over the stile.	175.70812780169058
What’s your name, sir?	117.65926774293258
Dunne, says he.	51.809446218198566
Ay, and done says I.	181.93724757703154
Gob, he’ll come home by weeping
cross one of those days, I’m thinking.	291.59645340937584
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	253.829497600801
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
p: up.	44.5676377971097
Looking for a private detective.	171.73539962389444
—Ay, says Ned.	206.69219148679485
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting
examined first.	296.72521705184056
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	483.8549744259771
God, I’d give anything to
hear him before a judge and jury.	257.9690604037999
—Was it you did it, Alf?	121.98331499839976
The truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	272.64693196906745
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	310.50440824577413
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
against you.	280.185991586767
—Of course an action would lie, says J.	373.2153137550235
It implies that he is not
_compos mentis_.	363.00621584015573
p: up.	44.5676377971097
_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	427.13495330205006
Do you know that he’s balmy?	105.43783823435906
Look at his head.	69.6523131999008
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
on with a shoehorn.	147.34525767056172
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	155.91422714717697
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	560.5822711712335
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	211.39084402021547
—Pity about her, says the citizen.	82.2332161960813
Or any other woman marries a half
and half.	207.03443348411946
—How half and half?	106.06399332158193
says Bloom.	203.15938669399281
Do you mean he...	76.39016823923087
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	170.5333804138118
A fellow that’s neither fish
nor flesh.	301.30028724217885
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.	416.7556959374405
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.	155.17187191081288
A pishogue, if you know what
that is.	153.37041130681342
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	279.0819292970525
And Bloom explaining he meant on
account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old
stuttering fool.	249.4584329632907
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
bringing down the rain.	244.59144906869736
And she with her nose cockahoop after she
married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the
pope.	186.4251367250397
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s
moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal
Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	295.11512837344134
And who was he, tell us?	104.35318408132773
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven
shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding
defiance to the world.	281.5264937251314
—And moreover, says J.	537.3269741599461
J., a postcard is publication.	227.82695501443993
It was held to be
sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	319.78365431808345
In my
opinion an action might lie.	363.61125053895375
Six and eightpence, please.	178.8112550995728
Who wants your opinion?	290.35117645009467
Let us drink our
pints in peace.	302.51400115007766
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.	221.04971929381227
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	480.74509596158913
—Good health, Ned, says J.	552.0048687375606
—-There he is again, says Joe.	152.5251188924343
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
secondhand coffin.	208.5733516338933
—How did that Canada swindle case go off?	336.5602589497172
—Remanded, says J.	206.69219148679485
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	334.02071512968655
Do you see
any green in the white of my eye?	111.77708965481193
Course it was a bloody barney.	117.98349917811794
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
his own kidney too.	266.11534867835445
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	253.6476881525491
—Who tried the case?	128.00082587767946
—Recorder, says Ned.	206.69219148679485
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	210.3605233947418
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	220.4494545778201
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve
in tears on the bench.	221.45270913208063
—Ay, says Alf.	206.69219148679485
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for
the corporation there near Butt bridge.	305.4506158340208
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
	218.54550064877427
—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	711.8509194467664
Ten, did you say?	93.96326597437702
—Yes, your worship.	212.78898653585637
And my wife has the typhoid.	175.85297097013827
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
immediately, sir.	403.6703456116965
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.	348.53180689633115
How dare
you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor
hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	372.89055935155443
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	436.0868306713707
And to the solemn
court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	243.08812893205555
And he sat
him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
and for the county of the city of Dublin.	147.55384646510953
And there sat with him the
high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of
the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen
and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the
tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte
and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and
true.	133.72384970265844
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should
well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined
between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss
the book.	282.8852033825156
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they
swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
rightwiseness.	288.58434200870414
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
in consequence of information received.	350.8566806290891
And they shackled him hand and
foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
against him for he was a malefactor.	290.9894882406667
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
filling the country with bugs.	268.12513634232147
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first
but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	266.3091709265193
And so Joe swore high
and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.	156.21662560680505
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
repetition.	256.0291788629468
—Rely on me, says Joe.	153.84967920661467
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	109.15182917414822
We
want no more strangers in our house.	217.54194467293698
—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	311.5447719517508
It’s just that
Keyes, you see.	135.56653571419076
—Consider that done, says Joe.	208.57383215762638
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.	150.4123338474207
—The strangers, says the citizen.	152.70453288751273
Our own fault.	232.28177835353148
We let them come in.	102.89905925913685
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
robbers here.	424.97312503014564
—Decree _nisi,_ says J.	384.36131238911986
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite
and when.	207.3986668766229
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all
our misfortunes.	162.06302176119294
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	234.45575772694522
—Give us a squint at her, says I.	203.487259181558
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows
off of Corny Kelleher.	355.5094411592227
Secrets for enlarging your private parts.	371.56501634380015
Misconduct of society belle.	221.55854577176166
Norman W.	203.15938669399281
Tupper, wealthy Chicago
contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.	940.3123804631274
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling
for her tickles and Norman W.	384.16318216898054
Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter
just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with
officer Taylor.	222.98791557302437
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
	567.5797640146278
—There’s hair, Joe, says I.	308.2247427052579
Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
of that one, what?	218.96346620771774
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
him as long as a late breakfast.	222.85678645553446
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?	126.65298451887737
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
about the Irish language?	359.5482389496258
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,
after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken
solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once
more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided
Gael.	342.5833664050995
—It’s on the march, says the citizen.	86.23330824548123
To hell with the bloody brutal
Sassenachs and their _patois._
	250.63694973303907
So J.	203.15938669399281
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting
your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to
impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and
botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	282.39182531255534
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	203.71392522090807
To hell with them!
The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody
thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature
worthy of the name.	332.85212893614903
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	280.0281593958894
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.	437.45909283442523
—The European family, says J.	499.4607031084257
—They’re not European, says the citizen.	170.5732682587766
I was in Europe with Kevin
Egan of Paris.	264.0440497155795
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	286.1558787097724
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
	160.6660569598813
He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
silent as the deathless gods.	413.58217455024527
—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	153.12036944410718
You look like a fellow that had
lost a bob and found a tanner.	158.64127030499967
—Gold cup, says he.	110.13866204966791
—Who won, Mr Lenehan?	560.9130524265852
says Terry.	203.15938669399281
_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one.	141.6110863241503
A rank outsider.	511.1191671054587
And the rest
nowhere.	158.6134584112309
—And Bass’s mare?	271.25653636066363
says Terry.	203.15938669399281
—Still running, says he.	112.77637467897809
We’re all in a cart.	117.77822834077415
Boylan plunged two quid
on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.	287.5599139057899
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
gave me.	353.2795564986159
Lord Howard de Walden’s.	357.5857383056818
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan.	140.776785736054
Such is life in an outhouse.	164.38426402126137
_Throwaway,_
says he.	54.22783869262825
Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.	211.9486286927496
Frailty, thy
name is _Sceptre._
	214.68097207188694
So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
luck with his mangy snout up.	259.52307706453587
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.	291.22284371312463
—Not there, my child, says he.	116.02348176091319
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.	365.1067187811318
She’d have won the money only for the
other dog.	148.60454020113892
And J.	203.15938669399281
and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
sticking in an odd word.	299.3719388103383
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they
can’t see the beam in their own.	220.5359286205296
—_Raimeis_, says the citizen.	65.88023201584484
There’s no-one as blind as the fellow
that won’t see, if you know what that means.	144.24896647260886
Where are our missing
twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
tribes?	451.2145699448153
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite
convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	369.12911665508426
Where are
the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the
Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian
purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?	277.80958136198825
Read Tacitus and
Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.	561.7051770323785
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,
silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,
the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs
duties for the right to fish in our waters.	549.586277078984
What do the yellowjohns of
Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?	420.4660124632765
And the beds
of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of
marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?	253.04889492989
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.	369.6345036162439
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.	268.0937648488903
I
was reading a report of lord Castletown’s...	188.07260351358576
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	281.80167723804453
Save the
trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
Eire, O.	224.25302596549335
The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
Valley.	751.7170788984916
The bride who was
given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked
exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised
silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of
broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,
the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
bronze.	452.88095821870894
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce
Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a
pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form
of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	484.5557543335658
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at
the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed
numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of
_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	312.80434980755143
On leaving
the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the
happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,
beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,
mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	793.9470180300118
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan
will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	498.12029175431934
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	158.73446540360328
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh.	170.43107692043975
Our harbours that are empty will be full
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a
fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the
O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	370.5123678398041
And will again, says he, when
the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own
flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag
afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns
on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	317.1383887932427
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	127.85831171332906
All wind and piss like
a tanyard cat.	293.2046648393098
Cows in Connacht have long horns.	243.5643569734174
As much as his bloody
life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
holding of an evicted tenant.	271.29628146774974
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	230.6220910617576
What will you have?	80.60655211199142
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	247.101735025047
Terry! Are you
asleep?	296.11249027052645
—Yes, sir, says Terry.	238.42038348459403
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	238.80853801691563
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
of attending to the general public.	295.632080195248
Picture of a butting match, trying
to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
head down like a bull at a gate.	208.0400152920404
And another one: _Black Beast Burned
in Omaha, Ga_.	602.982545960599
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing
at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
him.	272.98225923734515
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
crucify him to make sure of their job.	177.52136827670677
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
bay?	365.8393217529582
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	112.59602154908161
Hell upon earth it is.	128.90883154409443
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on
the training ships at Portsmouth.	210.12300031456272
A fellow writes that calls himself
_Disgusted One_.	508.6421577215156
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of
tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend
of a gun.	289.1562415389527
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on
the breech.	321.57846087614644
—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	206.98060782632535
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
till he yells meila murder.	242.49444076552408
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
earth.	254.71028839365704
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a
dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	229.84110952759488
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	240.89786459901507
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	103.16236763371042
The
unfortunate yahoos believe it.	478.9623149200924
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was
scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day
he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend
till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be
paid.	411.5841192942038
—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere.	379.10629442216674
I mean wouldn’t
it be the same here if you put force against force?	225.28706275773726
Didn’t I tell you?	185.9565995082048
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his
last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.	275.24980997289407
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.	255.36909727074632
We have our greater
Ireland beyond the sea.	298.50273531514523
They were driven out of house and home in the
black 47.	168.6252027534336
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
redskins in America.	364.42690635585706
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	364.9687915255418
But the
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	322.6740682368272
Ay,
they drove out the peasants in hordes.	222.5642044714732
Twenty thousand of them died in
the coffinships.	161.77833701023877
But those that came to the land of the free remember
the land of bondage.	116.33418825414789
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	301.8247316154715
—Perfectly true, says Bloom.	296.3502887006677
But my point was...	104.31381930612483
—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	197.37736754167125
Since the
poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
Killala.	167.7819830752341
—Ay, says John Wyse.	400.79936811672553
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	304.6237471101511
Remember Limerick and the
broken treatystone.	252.05976319876436
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
wild geese.	307.82348388835925
Fontenoy, eh?	118.07692457180981
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan
in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
Teresa.	449.5184541941984
—The French! says the citizen.	140.65373739453315
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what
it is?	192.51472268308189
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	370.9661482350976
Aren’t they
trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with
perfidious Albion?	504.4098965229839
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	121.1893786823927
—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	837.4228070292755
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George
the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s
dead?	262.13665197960046
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old
one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every
night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by
the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the
Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	241.81809309306976
—Well, says J.	206.69219148679485
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	253.05361154077028
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	81.62895444065259
There’s a bloody sight more pox
than pax about that boyo.	359.24138652062896
Edward Guelph-Wettin!
	494.0867752080217
—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
jockeys rode.	305.9121860741779
The earl of Dublin, no less.	299.58892485062466
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
Alf.	218.06754056257134
And says J.	206.69219148679485
—Will you try another, citizen?	201.1876330580881
—Yes, sir, says he.	84.45638559971286
I will.	60.46787389028839
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	207.95839259569456
May your shadow never grow less.	378.48983712290817
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.	306.38518619223
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling
about.	270.064243480686
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	80.70026786302776
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	840.8845230811376
—But do you know what a nation means?	156.71107272742458
says John Wyse.	494.0867752080217
—Yes, says Bloom.	206.69219148679485
—What is it?	44.73630436839303
says John Wyse.	494.0867752080217
—A nation?	170.64864202474547
says Bloom.	203.15938669399281
A nation is the same people living in the same
place.	155.88747753311154
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m
living in the same place for the past five years.	249.72899095661035
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to
muck out of it:
	158.04304478593244
—That covers my case, says Joe.	379.56935211691825
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
—Ireland, says Bloom.	206.69219148679485
I was born here.	120.02879516736436
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	229.9700138042436
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
swab himself dry.	238.5441653853684
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	204.61691962395267
Take that in your right hand and
repeat after me the following words.	158.52937395783354
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,
authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and
called forth prolonged admiration.	774.1836330431931
No need to dwell on the legendary
beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly
discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the
four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American
puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said
in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	387.0562498554858
The
scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and
raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive
stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as
when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy
long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	421.8581845394871
Glendalough, the lovely
lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh
and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh
Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company
(Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the
Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of
Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at
Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,
Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.	706.0013681408299
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,
Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,
the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,
Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today
rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed
over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	344.9898344348393
—Show us over the drink, says I.	194.42587215469885
Which is which?	65.05692896844023
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	172.0111917527093
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	334.2959075460155
Also now.	56.330396450281164
This very moment.	149.34143089758163
This very instant.	183.27580902475873
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	170.5181949573642
—Robbed, says he.	51.809446218198566
Taking what belongs
to us by right.	160.8614889248059
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	353.81408843051565
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	168.7681126410839
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	427.54705702178035
—Right, says John Wyse.	400.79936811672553
Stand up to it then with force like men.	129.33930476763558
That’s an almanac picture for you.	181.25195856758648
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	257.2533528572432
Old
lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	214.6417094652996
Gob, he’d adorn a
sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him.	186.32025932616267
—But it’s no use, says he.	95.92826703093301
Force, hatred, history, all that.	240.14506948999184
That’s not
life for men and women, insult and hatred.	197.89396879705353
And everybody knows that
it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.	142.47453483790233
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
—Love, says Bloom.	206.69219148679485
I must go now, says
he to John Wyse.	222.0359050706858
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
there.	130.7016422475561
If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second.	183.29932583437972
Just a moment.	63.39169238285437
Who’s hindering you?	156.32005012034298
And off he pops like greased lightning.	421.9273881253937
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	180.02019294175093
Universal love.	78.01990710471843
—Well, says John Wyse.	400.79936811672553
Isn’t that what we’re told.	138.83880840349187
Love your neighbour.	186.61339269089353
—That chap?	113.07104031998887
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	212.25250801187403
Love,
moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	303.9484151587482
Love loves to love love.	183.54621599607378
Nurse loves the new chemist.	241.95707183578122
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	206.37438734386802
loves a fair gentleman.	125.19167731035836
Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	1392.927009007873
Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant.	321.06692804667216
Old Mr Verschoyle with
the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	468.54611687161326
The man
in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	182.57437742921303
His Majesty the King
loves Her Majesty the Queen.	507.9504921527953
Mrs Norman W.	494.0867752080217
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	708.1287458574128
You love a certain person.	170.43430375000338
And this person loves that other person
because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	586.24196918324
More power,
citizen.	179.66124796662152
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.	190.59016641814532
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.	182.40986423965475
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	213.07690666680534
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	325.98335419227055
The bible! Did you read that skit
in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting
England?	417.7380866694042
—What’s that?	37.77232725523974
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
reading out:
	185.33444601529965
—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in
Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the
heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in
his dominions.	478.9197068342683
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of
which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely
translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod
Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the
cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,
stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an
illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of
England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief
woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the
august hand of the Royal Donor.	375.18209077300224
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of
firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty
Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and
signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a
charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed
several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	429.92283898790373
—Widow woman, says Ned.	238.71139856009376
I wouldn’t doubt her.	205.25461934777073
Wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as I would.	177.12462144276333
—Same only more so, says Lenehan.	228.7410210889797
And thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	707.9055647413524
—Is that by Griffith?	128.64967142702747
says John Wyse.	494.0867752080217
—No, says the citizen.	65.88023201584484
It’s not signed Shanganagh.	248.15095503475587
It’s only
initialled: P.	321.4018813382218
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.	253.29298413440603
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen.	117.91935548660368
Trade follows the flag.	186.98218223443817
—Well, says J.	206.69219148679485
J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the
Congo Free State they must be bad.	326.63796933563106
Did you read that report by a man
what’s this his name is?	123.34129396370345
—Casement, says the citizen.	65.88023201584484
He’s an Irishman.	143.97847672526615
—Yes, that’s the man, says J.	103.38630199397863
Raping the women and girls and
flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they
can out of them.	166.51553477134306
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	238.2273620476361
—Bloom, says he.	51.809446218198566
The courthouse is a blind.	188.91655208616592
He had a few bob on
_Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.	163.26660586875607
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	288.5458059484642
says the citizen, that never backed a
horse in anger in his life?	154.56974910381638
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan.	147.59652019026754
I met Bantam Lyons going to back
that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	256.4291054685109
He’s the
only man in Dublin has it.	111.75225785046459
A dark horse.	186.04830361155834
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	226.54497260930228
—Mind, Joe, says I.	400.79936811672553
Show us the entrance out.	129.55570087683753
—There you are, says Terry.	163.54862798948255
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
about selling Irish industries.	371.9291239874086
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	340.6109862012386
Gob, that
puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	240.586173957136
Give us a bloody chance.	172.89376366788116
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
mouseabout.	258.99201431625517
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	424.67297891008343
And his old fellow before
him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	383.35342249355784
Loans by post on easy terms.	257.65590061170064
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	229.01120902564216
Distance no object.	160.4362475343428
No
security.	287.40150812754337
Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the
road with every one.	179.0497414945867
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse.	200.47816448253283
And there’s the man now that’ll
tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	156.13700616434417
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the
collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
country at the king’s expense.	304.3572347806901
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
palfreys.	583.4010289987222
Saucy knave! To us!
	598.8655725546819
So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	320.2426979337774
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	300.7999182070996
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	281.8652059489557
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	470.6593719070662
Look to our steeds.	173.57683739079013
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	248.61484875679642
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
larder.	256.38178261199334
I know not what to offer your lordships.	227.92464830300915
—How now, fellow?	116.3627536249918
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?	290.6423711744206
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.	507.04658026185086
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	245.6078446126071
An you be the king’s
messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	373.0239120776816
The
king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
house I warrant me.	623.626356868184
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
trencherman by his aspect.	296.3936570056675
Hast aught to give us?	191.2558063663854
Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
	267.30991932212
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s
head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a
flagon of old Rhenish?	458.6244406636321
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	197.712970048455
That likes me well.	187.58450640102018
—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	141.07693268835587
A poor house and a bare
larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.	447.4260589958027
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	327.54502522091684
—Where is he?	40.04036031893841
says Lenehan.	203.15938669399281
Defrauding widows and orphans.	310.9098224325163
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	268.96752568810547
—That’s so, says Martin.	156.98413341470055
Or so they allege.	210.077935067247
—Who made those allegations?	319.8660226398218
says Alf.	203.15938669399281
—I, says Joe.	206.69219148679485
I’m the alligator.	144.28528748606414
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like
the next fellow?	239.5462264371335
—Why not?	43.63875407829325
says J.	203.15938669399281
J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.	141.58928386033008
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
hell is he?	159.56638892183904
says Ned.	203.15938669399281
Or who is he?	59.50237583575334
No offence, Crofton.	530.5057920717607
—Who is Junius?	159.40530101824655
says J.	203.15938669399281
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	276.1859521516494
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	209.50984539373485
We know
that in the castle.	78.62611742972248
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	157.44654750482155
Only namesakes.	464.672675952932
His name was Virag, the
father’s name that poisoned himself.	182.25306826079478
He changed it by deedpoll, the
father did.	177.97693323243135
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	151.13240882732453
Island of saints
and sages!
	186.88461238785854
—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	317.84193930807487
For that
matter so are we.	131.20695279889088
J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their
Messiah.	193.18198562142473
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
that died was born.	247.46512546295548
I met him one day in the south city markets buying
a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	307.69051741294834
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J.	1296.4876867987143
—Do you call that a man?	78.05969456913483
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	192.83402132794282
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	407.2197824037225
—And who does he suspect?	197.11182402036226
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest.	218.33457293551444
One of those mixed
middlings he is.	176.72887912549982
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
month with headache like a totty with her courses.	227.62071768837652
Do you know what I’m
telling you?	195.95259867532513
It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	122.09032019714873
Justifiable homicide, so it
would.	205.79969336828427
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
stuff like a man.	224.95909218065546
Give us your blessing.	221.2483023599398
Not as much as would blind
your eye.	191.99286767843856
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	155.96928552797436
But where is he?	64.38719365194252
We can’t wait.	139.26934326050272
—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen.	232.42058376097287
That’s what he is.	54.52981402224962
Virag
from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	419.4748362484562
Cursed by God.	163.80936724363383
says Ned.	203.15938669399281
—Only one, says Martin.	192.6360997699471
We must be quick.	157.46461724753016
and S.	203.15938669399281
—You, Jack?	203.15938669399281
Three half ones, Terry.	459.6062490382362
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
shores.	324.9228721076738
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	346.46740542376745
God bless all here is my
prayer.	233.85153000565333
—Amen, says the citizen.	65.88023201584484
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.	491.3554555173822
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and
Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
of S.	434.4910120411383

And all came
with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,
forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	1305.8649541516422
And as they wended their way
by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little
Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which
beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual
_Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as
casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,
healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had
been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and
prophesying.	697.2674092061776
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the
reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	423.49426201480196
And when the
good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard
Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale
grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine
and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the
house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults
and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and
the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the
lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that
house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	306.6300420335976
And entering he
blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed
answered his prayers.	168.29210636390397
—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._
	410.0471033356832
—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._
	966.7259059966882
—_Dominus vobiscum._
	238.19223555623844
—_Et cum spiritu tuo._
	766.346352716063
And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he
prayed and they all with him prayed:
	147.60939883599406
—_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore
percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._
	4101.208626453124
—And so say all of us, says Jack.	161.9736322426271
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	351.0173650104759
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	391.23623666080545
And butter for fish.	227.86568952075328
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike
when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a
hurry.	180.43655772788063
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	130.41658305338862
I hope
I’m not...	267.65594544525106
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.	340.62453011975214
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	200.86152050907276
Mean bloody scut.	390.6058044436987
Stand us a drink itself.	165.5297911639265
Devil a sweet fear! There’s
a jew for you! All for number one.	213.64714484162644
Hundred to
five.	72.05506879200829
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.	153.89834463788972
—Beg your pardon, says he.	153.8553779285359
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	265.6804952859751
Come along now.	121.53246414038202
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	179.48920955170513
It’s a
secret.	77.36421089726585
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	204.2624802395964
—Bye bye all, says Martin.	331.9157484459187
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be
all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	165.50470925599504
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	121.58305594681626
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off
forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	385.1663750760063
A many comely
nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the
sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the
cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds
them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas
they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	340.2058009047812
Even so
did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	315.3559822559664
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark
clave the waves.	242.17268545096357
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little
Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	267.7522763112704
—Let me alone, says he.	111.93696699158549
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
out of him:
	133.95610333689623
—Three cheers for Israel!
	307.8998906457215
Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake
and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	270.7843004884936
Jesus, there’s
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
bloody nothing.	295.4991850962338
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
would.	210.7223052595293
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and
Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews
and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him
to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a
patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,
jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:
	211.73438081222577
—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
	659.3238532803699
And says he:
	51.809446218198566
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	222.83453457994102
And
the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	103.12354012338119
Your God.	203.15938669399281
—He had no father, says Martin.	198.6934458695516
That’ll do now.	125.32767380603612
—Whose God?	203.15938669399281
says the citizen.	44.480144466065326
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	115.07082305848604
Your God was a jew.	151.92294011781146
Christ was a
jew like me.	91.01393034868937
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	164.66093538064288
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
name.	357.88108500044615
By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will.	538.3417572942805
Give us that biscuitbox here.	222.22352951422693
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.	400.79936811672553
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for
the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of
Murmuring Waters).	496.8919300426745
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	435.26340039853307
An illuminated scroll
of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	449.10898993269507
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of
Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,
followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.	502.6823893162497
Tarbarrels and bonfires
were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the
Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains
of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of
M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	433.5124085173049
Amid
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a
big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,
the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and
Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	373.19729975119265
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not
forgotten.	687.5992793776696
Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s
royal theatre:
	216.27868648646015
And Ned and J.	249.5976425755857
paralysed with the laughing.	61.534044635587485
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.	298.81059141649706
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other
way and off with him.	142.30290124450005
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	211.08774518409234
Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	167.60143919998697
Mercy of God the
sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.	121.86761099716396
Gob, he near sent
it into the county Longford.	204.66959841394927
The bloody nag took fright and the old
mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting
and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	250.91630409835352
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	326.09319957882207
The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the
fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a
similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,
the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	349.31286695367436
The epicentre appears to
have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay
ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,
two roods and one square pole or perch.	443.3371676852719
All the lordly residences in
the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble
edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal
debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it
is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	281.89566811222664
From the
reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were
accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character.	436.0654623630504
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the
much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a
silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat
of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of
quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been
discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island
respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s
causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in
the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	383.95659635707597
Other
eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of
enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying
velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	645.071431574593
Messages of
condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the
different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously
pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be
celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority
of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff.	129.45778763568697
Gob, if he got that
lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he
would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and
battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	256.7298853424717
The jarvey saved his life by
furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	483.5299595338951
And
he let a volley of oaths after him.	164.9379495855993
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?	194.21400076824844
And he shouting to the bloody dog:
	131.96602124940708
—After him, Garry! After him, boy!
	300.43272795101313
And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	215.72512989129342
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
you.	167.72158539037127
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	354.2933511140238
And they beheld Him in
the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having
raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they
durst not look upon Him.	259.72797036280497
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:
_Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And
they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels
ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	459.69524468624604
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace.	356.69820282191046
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a
beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	272.63062866911844
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	253.9789587316495
Many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name _H.	356.73358196946134
Belleisle_ printed on both.	183.63185202843545
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	437.19606432946136
They
were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building
castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy
as the day was long.	304.8308000961942
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight.	365.47655570823605
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a
tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	315.65899992604284
Cissy
Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty
dimple in his chin.	272.7950286528209
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	451.4050032462717
Say out big, big.	154.15055010664148
I want a drink of
water.	117.35963178377844
And baby prattled after her:
	322.1258296687146
—A jink a jink a jawbo.	408.14092595778845
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of
children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could
never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that
held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown
bread with golden syrup on.	366.6547053311552
What a persuasive power that girl had! But
to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in
his new fancy bib.	314.3123087611307
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	285.5318234483959
And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	338.0768022514608
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
Master Jacky.	398.9010611223355
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to
this golden rule.	287.8824080945569
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like
the Martello tower had.	321.1935457043271
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky
was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s
house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose
that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too.	370.3123235622538
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master
Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	233.52935945643742
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	440.6173940928564
At once! And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	327.98639994341033
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister’s word was law with the twins.	327.37676857949157
His little man-o’-war top and
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	268.62603538046153
Still the blue
eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed
away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and
said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing
in admonition.	242.88880698257032
—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	376.01499027629234
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
	335.5931919742568
—What’s your name?	88.75750520813591
Butter and cream?	88.75746038015083
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	419.78405148814784
Is Cissy your
sweetheart?	378.45437769756927
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.	513.1062126338354
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	569.5842963517823
Cissy queried.	226.01928839956565
—Nao, Tommy said.	165.5081573229974
—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
her shortsighted eyes.	444.02433041321905
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.	227.81259504921073
Gerty is
Tommy’s sweetheart.	226.9396352305248
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	176.09679141857458
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.	278.5798013751651
But who was Gerty?	157.22957797993504
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	339.9621055882372
She was
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,
she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	268.82064494826045
Her figure was slight and
graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had
been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the
Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges
she used to get and that tired feeling.	299.24200538589963
The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth
was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.	531.6150254807294
Her hands were of finely
veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and
queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used
to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	335.1097210985913
Bertha Supple
told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black
out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their
little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or
she’d never speak to her again.	218.89107986266438
Honour where honour is due.	249.37062431584704
There
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	604.7387612645499
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their
devoirs to her.	310.11994990708075
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that
lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed
meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful
eyes, a charm few could resist.	302.5204384304458
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	230.32489015374617
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and
dark expressive brows.	394.1144056822986
Time was when those brows were not so silkily
seductive.	357.9191852749492
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	345.1084960518057
Then
there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase
your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	271.2252240230881
But Gerty’s crowning
glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	369.35995077288015
It was dark brown with a
natural wave in it.	157.73343626043405
She had cut it that very morning on account of the
new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	274.1095819750735
And
just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet
girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not
hold her equal.	374.3482507671642
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	287.3615994058328
She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	202.70088831124184
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	241.42540181971933
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young
May morning.	268.01702217456534
She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
lovers’ quarrel.	290.51802876636964
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about
the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding
up and down in front of her window.	224.39761767181108
Only now his father kept him in in
the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate
that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a
doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	183.65225255731232
Wylie who
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	322.8223399929145
Little
recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart
sometimes, piercing to the core.	338.42267500968075
Yet he was young and perchance he
might learn to love her in time.	138.69281026090673
They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	311.4115216044888
But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the
bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice
perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front
of her bit of a garden.	180.31838377016413
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
out.	193.3677729651735
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because
it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be
worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful
figure to perfection.	400.1983560214007
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	357.5219932844734
All Tuesday
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she
found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	333.15529952466574
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to
her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew
that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	189.64675435444573
Her shoes
were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she
was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a
five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle over her higharched instep.	474.52669912318555
Her wellturned ankle displayed
its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount
and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with
highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	599.803686151768
As for undies they were Gerty’s
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet
seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in
his heart to blame her?	311.0008275840355
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty
stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,
and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the
wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because
she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching
the things.	409.5167106446199
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her
own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and
because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside
out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things
on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so
long as it wasn’t of a Friday.	220.67368283569934
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time.	331.2301006924193
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror.	250.8868030380038
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	186.9882572101221
The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	451.72772609344565
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	492.01706108105003
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	311.32641793481196
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs
Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
was not to be.	350.40390842461824
He was too young to understand.	127.27613180658159
He would not believe in
love, a woman’s birthright.	172.2850480218991
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	198.89205996479416
He called her
little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
the room with a remark about refreshments.	187.7479275769907
Impetuous fellow! Strength
of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would
woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	349.6378932129969
But waiting,
always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be
over.	195.17083351190328
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort
her with a long long kiss.	272.8368556482643
It would be like heaven.	153.3694622990738
For such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.	363.5409939593922
With all the heart of her she longs to be
his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in
health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	231.62562543388347
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be.	240.73172984757153
Then they could talk about her till they went blue
in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she
would be twentytwo in November.	300.29473318430837
She would care for him with creature
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked
that feeling of hominess.	316.9511493315858
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue
and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same
direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of
eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people
that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something
poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully
appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph
of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was
so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in
Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	360.8442883167154
He would be
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	341.47653088332106
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then
she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	190.36220538942715
But Tommy
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with
the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said
it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please.	175.41770917837488
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	234.26402773400852
Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	128.90401128145515
—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	316.7359917858139
It’s my ball.	110.01355023440314
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	274.5452013440571
—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	246.49194568695467
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played
here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
chin.	316.3893448581967
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.	295.0056651069189
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t
say.	241.03326068958327
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	654.5722256150925
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	285.5848213328849
But not a pin cared
Ciss.	315.7675267496887
—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose.	179.70744482607503
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
him.	148.92543362618036
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	413.0961141341492
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	136.8606051843239
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea
and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on
her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to
go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the
Miss White.	239.32167165235242
That was just like Cissycums.	170.74009954174818
O, and will you ever forget
her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the
burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a
cigarette.	221.42075490652775
There was none to come up to her for fun.	125.73285269074557
But she was
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	297.0899451185074
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ.	163.8676909202371
It was the men’s temperance retreat
conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	377.1058427263968
J., rosary,
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	465.9856805756322
They were there
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins.	357.9817228884441
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided
the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders
the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in
her carriage, second to none.	334.6376613560571
Over and over had she told herself that
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	266.240038908866
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had
cast its shadow over her childhood days.	514.8546086627722
Nay, she had even witnessed in
the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen
her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself
completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it
was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	215.89438343636868
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful.	382.5031150298277
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	334.21457435887044
You never saw him
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	186.08942852048722
Poor
father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper
and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died
suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	436.500848947144
Her
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken.	245.7920364559601
No-one would have thought the end was so near.	143.42199830997214
Now
he was laid to rest.	106.25710323227088
And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.	210.46439184965234
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
gold.	262.64668847124614
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t
like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	330.21001192133923
Everyone thought the
world of her for her gentle ways.	134.12639280067768
It was Gerty who turned off the gas
at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of
that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime
Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	302.9031274667738
You could see there was a
story behind it.	132.39756507257508
The colours were done something lovely.	330.2885240973127
She was in a
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	197.9295290268657
She often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.	294.6441500047387
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till
at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no
getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	361.99802888848257
Needless to say poor Tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball.	241.4354626174511
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries
and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it
to her please.	357.96870010851984
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the
rock.	290.85894443833126
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it
away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she
wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a
kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	287.09636476067226
—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	446.96517984998286
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	324.2729998951028
A delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball
a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it
down towards the shingle.	254.99563929588584
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	217.1367305980344
She
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,
surging and flaming into her cheeks.	491.81998255634096
Till then they had only exchanged
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had
ever seen.	223.24213041425213
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	369.19275815978415
And
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,
the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in
any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever
abandoned by her.	327.9193892237818
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	402.6099178318689
Cissy Caffrey played with
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	516.417265278801
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was
Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my
word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say
papa.	250.72551761855215
—Say papa, baby.	347.0038817970501
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	810.2799989535658
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
to be something great, they said.	199.1359717584286
—Haja ja ja haja.	1323.9445574685471
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
blanket the other way under him.	278.9813048362313
Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
	359.18174371150957
—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	1247.7144807542668
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	423.3291480729459
It was all
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen
was quickly appeased.	253.95238854213946
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins.	206.5154182109378
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	226.01153839855328
It was like the
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,
the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and
to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they
burned in the church like a kind of waft.	173.24617050349048
And while she gazed her heart
went pitapat.	330.743404506492
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning
in his look.	96.07921951908608
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her
through and through, read her very soul.	231.74856728715412
Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	314.8930902539533
People were so queer.	164.84105564951523
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face
that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin
Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred
because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they
two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see
whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he
was sitting.	244.21701543758272
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story
of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	161.28440371148818
She would have given
worlds to know what it was.	159.96525458130378
He was looking up so intently, so still,
and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the
toes down.	213.8726168257072
She was glad that something told her to put on the
transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was
far away.	241.5506515942401
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	141.48039712591006
It was he
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.	186.4248277937324
The very
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she
knew on the instant it was him.	157.72641909495667
If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
man, she cared not.	296.04548170403945
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could
convert him easily if he truly loved her.	254.74472407803268
There were wounds that wanted
healing with heartbalm.	433.086617394287
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the
past.	239.60175686485692
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for
herself alone.	315.637574528284
Refuge of sinners.	155.25731673228717
Comfortress of the afflicted.	72.24123518182918
_Ora pro nobis_.	732.9361714425288
Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her
own heart.	270.9482524573199
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
cast down.	288.9253009685271
He told her that time
when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots
of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was
only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he
said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the
nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady
herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to
Thy Word.	206.49315500180543
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and
thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or
some place.	215.0387860195994
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	293.65499760004553
Little
monkeys common as ditchwater.	616.3782969834517
Someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them.	154.0857237802116
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	225.76155246612242
—Jacky! Tommy!
	203.15938669399281
Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
last time she’d ever bring them out.	240.27136019399038
She jumped up and called them and
she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow
long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat
at it.	213.50180882664395
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible.	214.36350485709315
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up
over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French
heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	291.0604520290727
_Tableau!_
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness.	217.88081066294532
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy
handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and
censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and
she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she
didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a
bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking
that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed
the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the
Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she
just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	288.2842986745322
Three and eleven she paid for those
stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was
looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
head to see the difference for himself.	193.5367730396796
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought
only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her
petticoat hanging like a caricature.	211.59538016365488
Gerty just took off her hat for a
moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown
tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	302.4241352946004
You would have to travel
many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	153.01121912838997
She
could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes
that set her tingling in every nerve.	287.178562006419
She put on her hat so that she
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster
for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	251.15314660082572
He was
eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	258.80249132890384
Her woman’s instinct told her that
she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a
glorious rose.	222.45329210865555
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby.	347.0723234255701
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no
concern of hers.	187.03670508122016
And she said to Gerty:
	115.72613689024156
—A penny for your thoughts.	213.3726323137768
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	237.88410254894958
I
was only wondering was it late.	185.22764803196495
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late.	247.1131145867002
And when Cissy came up Edy
asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was
half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	266.6148490140513
But Edy wanted to know
because they were told to be in early.	191.91539417675793
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the
time by his conundrum.	299.3999664545972
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.	174.04485384727806
Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	265.3649004586553
One moment
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	267.9615771040664
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set.	181.2087941940397
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	229.4502072852708
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
his waterworks were out of order.	172.16237205658183
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon
got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he
told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and
she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the
works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	224.20387416819673
It was getting
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it
back and put his hands back into his pockets.	134.0853417520743
She felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.	178.10875605432014
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her
every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	422.4597216988498
If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to
be seen on that man’s face.	187.84359028540197
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you
know it.	138.57826304100695
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	270.4985759364767
Gerty winced sharply.	945.156575694437
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn
immeasurable.	525.2654505310803
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was.	319.5103934799411
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but
she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	362.29793976809407
She had loved him better than he knew.	183.90062852387018
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle
like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and
for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	191.7114821387492
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them
to see.	302.6575962448276
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
flashed up.	414.85045247511346
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.	290.7390121117745
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	363.8756624742961
There was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	126.2752048788005
As
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a
dozen pieces.	249.46526015377418
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	256.69139127954327
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	252.06408769948206
And Cissy told
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	296.4232933812675
—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	884.2172483927325
He has his bib destroyed.	333.0306396453566
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
that little matter to rights.	397.90116298435134
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	275.3402819631675
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time
a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
thither, with a tiny lost cry.	311.85735049487204
And she could see far away the lights of
the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church
grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked
and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn
his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss
Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	333.94316068376173
For Gerty had her
dreams that no-one knew of.	182.20550080404374
She loved to read poetry and when she got a
keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the
coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of
her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was
scrupulously neat and clean.	274.80226761040706
It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs.	311.66566258943544
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J
Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt
thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the
years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	306.0950024438143
But it must end, she felt.	164.3914099163175
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
would be no holding back for her.	189.50643906841213
Love laughs at locksmiths.	361.3497781470523
She would
make the great sacrifice.	190.7961790476095
Her every effort would be to share his
thoughts.	270.5311237031855
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
days with happiness.	172.61314541818973
There was the allimportant question and she was
dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	182.62920635617695
But
even if—what then?	127.56973706124677
Would it make a very great difference?	183.09440229346146
From
everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
recoiled.	521.8166443042657
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and
being taken up to the police station.	264.1605385827641
No, no: not that.	66.31711962090286
They would be
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	207.74622934923252
Perhaps it was
an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	164.90167890762268
She
thought she understood.	205.91303770192363
She would try to understand him because men
were so different.	227.72329751081122
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	299.14325925546063
Heart of mine! She would
follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
the master guide.	139.93840590491308
Nothing else mattered.	489.9629025999086
Come what might she would be
wild, untrammelled, free.	297.60675482095553
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked
wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
	395.43260197878965
—O, look, Cissy!
	253.3521602119922
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	226.79182671557817
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	373.2296763945595
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.	231.90101678112393
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	362.362670230305
It’s the bazaar fireworks.	157.40992690465487
But Gerty was adamant.	408.93118489314026
She had no intention of being at their beck and
call.	200.815621031522
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she
could see from where she was.	200.47143282776048
The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling.	373.3507694160802
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her.	163.14134145131962
Whitehot passion was in that face,
passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	149.58879664260235
At last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.	245.74308724374174
His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her.	186.3548647406647
She leaned back far to look up where the
fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall
back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she
revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of
men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead
secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that
was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had
pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and
she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine
sometimes in the bed.	245.0127486350143
But this was altogether different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips.	191.26147040642357
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on
the way it did.	243.76605808116415
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	189.54032763768637
And
she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so
immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	251.67294512254057
She
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry
that has rung through the ages.	269.25869364877843
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot
blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh
of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a
stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,
soft!
	381.0084810846792
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	256.1144297315909
Ah! She
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	376.2813126096832
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	205.7776226263298
Leopold Bloom (for it is
he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	297.1706508446547
What a brute he had been! At it again?	174.1786216811816
A fair unsullied soul had called
to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	196.96781846621388
An utter cad he
had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in
those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and
sinned and wandered.	281.98280533901874
Should a girl tell?	102.44588827265703
That
was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there
was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly
through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.	240.87597632458466
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:
	239.12675185529957
—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going.	483.34262802921603
Come on.	32.610077424956444
We can see from farther up.	173.65126985819649
Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.	190.2422631298832
She slipped a hand into
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
course without letting him and then slipped it back.	232.80742807668335
Wonder if he’s too
far to.	87.62824063576024
Was it goodbye?	124.73862325169601
She had to go but they would meet
again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
dream of yester eve.	198.6357635417307
She drew herself up to her full height.	243.2539675482996
Their
souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her
heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet
flowerlike face.	302.0871564224666
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	348.65125747080305
It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
slippy seaweed.	235.75503705595656
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell
was...	286.1743736579115
Tight boots?	115.85783954169504
She’s lame! O!
	309.06162541160484
Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	338.26130490447616
Poor girl! That’s why she’s
left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	172.9121837138027
Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib.	161.42142628863763
Jilted beauty.	119.75275850328055
A defect is ten times worse
in a woman.	236.29316609826827
But makes them polite.	299.94014816028124
Glad I didn’t know it when she was
on show.	179.8900408062695
Hot little devil all the same.	117.94122609627661
I wouldn’t mind.	189.0198389528172
Curiosity like
a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	175.6009303784145
That squinty one is
delicate.	344.7050609875587
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	726.2040457135075
I
have such a bad headache today.	244.01120309820416
Where did I put the letter?	188.06781777100113
Yes, all
right.	76.4165853829928
All kinds of crazy longings.	491.87361079506536
Licking pennies.	216.97884341188544
Girl in Tranquilla
convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	397.86769154027917
Virgins go mad in the
end I suppose.	220.49430763713224
How many women in Dublin have it today?	222.22252970631934
Martha,
she.	39.93019424155908
Something in the air.	44.602231448042986
That’s the moon.	61.40367502143435
But then why don’t all
women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	225.29257035271172
Depends
on the time they were born I suppose.	170.23607593582108
Or all start scratch then get out
of step.	244.67401712749185
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	323.7237400699108
Anyhow I got the best of
that.	113.17962878916178
Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her
silly I will punish you letter.	304.47270733731494
Made up for that tramdriver this
morning.	172.1120510354827
That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing.	566.790938748621
And his wife
engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	233.45953200265456
Thankful for
small mercies.	296.0996473454908
Cheap too.	56.16717052284047
Yours for the asking.	73.02819560770183
Because they want it
themselves.	137.7060649704259
Their natural craving.	523.2435264313274
Shoals of them every evening poured
out of offices.	210.18839208067303
Reserve better.	85.52706137596047
Don’t want it they throw it at you.	120.89745279147279
Catch em alive, O.	702.7596800020691
Pity they can’t see themselves.	158.83991629520082
A dream of
wellfilled hose.	432.2670881890615
Where was that?	40.27220657095264
Ah, yes.	60.45787357664621
Mutoscope pictures in Capel
street: for men only.	254.5885634437948
Peeping Tom.	203.15938669399281
Willy’s hat and what the girls did
with it.	88.63946737146671
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	207.21634845881619
_Lingerie_
does it.	82.72415975155268
Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also
when they’re.	258.0503214771612
I’m all clean come and dirty me.	177.45686638246656
And they like dressing
one another for the sacrifice.	180.89425008920813
Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.	359.4644323828835
At first.	66.0501842233661
Put them all on to take them all off.	103.20201739078816
Why I bought her
the violet garters.	327.7929457640097
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and
turnedup trousers.	258.91010026727577
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we
met.	188.57924534878578
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	263.1368754882144
of jet.	205.31528992885768
Say a woman
loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	256.8166073049286
Pinned together.	113.7429156304855
O, Mairy
lost the pin of her.	150.6140874168213
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	139.56990870410584
Fashion part
of their charm.	178.7422091849521
Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.	149.4752391558052
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	263.04324961807947
No reasonable offer
refused.	1077.8112991585351
She wasn’t in a hurry either.	192.09581793159253
Always off to a fellow when they
are.	98.46623913885698
They never forget an appointment.	320.74186561532883
Out on spec probably.	330.0944796720461
They
believe in chance because like themselves.	238.39369236289744
And the others inclined to
give her an odd dig.	235.39676033968402
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs
and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they
can’t get.	312.5312417182717
Barbed wire.	209.1917535402865
Be sure now and write to me.	116.14104536521096
Now won’t you?	108.25268463424716
Molly and Josie Powell.	249.5976425755857
Till Mr Right comes along,
then meet once in a blue moon.	367.3848379377912
_Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the
love of God! How are you at all?	160.03848013051157
What have you been doing with
yourself?	172.41084507905086
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	119.82365950173225
Picking holes in
each other’s appearance.	248.05010272364473
You’re looking splendid.	301.79729923321077
Sister souls.	152.27261904360242
Showing
their teeth at one another.	162.33632167024712
How many have you left?	140.19329781305976
Wouldn’t lend each
other a pinch of salt.	265.3371595607684
Devils they are when that’s coming on them.	104.22630561171586
Dark devilish appearance.	807.2224202213118
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	342.7609194659023
Scratch the sole of my
foot.	116.05141990174434
O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	252.8550190186552
Good to rest
once in a way.	100.04861052569156
Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then.	105.33299067978247
Safe in one
way.	72.52656310728959
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	800.1005657059178
Something about withering
plants I read in a garden.	372.0058162888284
Besides they say if the flower withers she
wears she’s a flirt.	222.64070467033514
All are.	51.952073304782346
When you feel like
that you often meet what you feel.	163.24548580389472
Liked me or what?	73.87108162579571
Dress they look
at.	91.05416875926181
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	345.2321727968035
Well cocks and
lions do the same and stags.	228.807830083366
Same time might prefer a tie undone or
something.	366.48820399408123
Suppose I when I was?	280.7922352385168
Gently does it.	82.72415975155268
Dislike
rough and tumble.	253.06221002383677
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	77.7304684881246
Saw something in me.	75.38988627336734
Wonder what.	42.76162057125033
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with
bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	577.8440670214253
To aid
gentleman in literary.	265.49627015437653
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	238.34102012614235
Didn’t
let her see me in profile.	153.67845931172016
Still, you never know.	97.45541945270769
Pretty girls and ugly
men marrying.	387.44370675929804
Beauty and the beast.	61.65600174605264
Besides I can’t be so if Molly.	267.6963677397116
Took off her hat to show her hair.	137.53943912515206
Wide brim.	287.40150812754337
Bought to hide her face,
meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers
to smell.	269.3206040285093
Hair strong in rut.	230.38665411630134
Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when
we were on the rocks in Holles street.	292.1258100990748
Why not?	43.63875407829325
Suppose he gave her
money.	109.58637552603543
Why not?	43.63875407829325
All a prejudice.	163.73695834995112
She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a
pound.	263.0476401477874
I think so.	107.14561403859544
All that for nothing.	80.39999436773991
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	432.4628293926462
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent
to Flynn?	330.92655146565073
And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie.	221.63051726811955
Wrangle
with Molly it was put me off.	140.42384633967433
No, I remember.	316.260267234867
Richie Goulding: he’s
another.	143.33500578769824
Weighs on his mind.	75.10279454377661
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	275.52604141078007
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	323.14741409491484
Could do it myself.	111.02229767266805
Was
that just when he, she?	81.48130361298155
O, he did.	52.61252329452052
Into her.	34.64317786172705
She did.	58.03818204032362
Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	484.6393627930271
O Lord, that
little limping devil.	422.8624611720685
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	187.5716828102617
Aftereffect not
pleasant.	150.20859948002993
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	143.61694694405128
They don’t care.	163.28954564814242
Complimented perhaps.	101.2844572487834
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	283.3308964683417
Well, aren’t they?	188.9288519117638
See her as she is spoil
all.	127.87772000077265
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	379.47792042654606
The name too.	104.71827589449468
_Amours_ of actresses.	142.1392572123614
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud
Branscombe.	1201.6266902949878
Curtain up.	45.161717238889764
Moonlight silver effulgence.	399.2482649188127
Maiden discovered
with pensive bosom.	425.4934882951799
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	193.69862858233637
Still, I feel.	293.2658089794439
The strength it gives a man.	162.9887913305535
That’s the secret of it.	57.47216519887914
Good job I let
off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s.	234.4156141982524
Otherwise I couldn’t have.	253.98242914896608
Makes you want to sing after.	126.92664744448875
_Lacaus esant
taratara_.	1247.7144807542668
Suppose I spoke to her.	176.021781890917
What about?	52.40978887817269
Ask them a question they ask
you another.	156.1041088276957
Good idea if you’re stuck.	209.04019444643512
But then you’re in a
cart.	113.64910180732102
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s
on for it: good evening.	122.94372396487653
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I
nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	332.2141802000668
Whew! Girl in Meath
street that night.	227.01408706439065
All the dirty things I made her say.	228.15324931175653
All wrong of
course.	108.55260013847249
My arks she called it.	253.52019769875128
It’s so hard to find one who.	133.85597574142983
Aho! If
you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they
harden.	341.1459187197938
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	286.4771238017373
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	173.58661236943541
Wish she hadn’t
called me sir.	208.06645802767787
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a
single girl! That’s what they enjoy.	193.62004261901106
Taking a man from another woman.	113.44462770011312
Or even hear of it.	94.1642463627358
Different with me.	49.49863361224704
Glad to get away from other
chap’s wife.	154.40979039356614
Eating off his cold plate.	204.5532968753769
Chap in the Burton today
spitting back gumchewed gristle.	447.49826369218556
French letter still in my pocketbook.	211.27990623309344
Cause of half the trouble.	87.3648202562598
But might happen sometime, I don’t think.	514.8760205584473
Come in, all is prepared.	111.57575679199009
Worst is beginning.	135.267598406147
How they
change the venue when it’s not what they like.	133.0975626164788
Ask you do you like
mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	194.2716159402191
Or ask you what
someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	171.7340900133669
Yet if I
went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	263.3594805291657
Because I did.	214.31595369956432
She too.	56.16717052284047
Offend her.	34.64317786172705
Then make it up.	85.99973024722193
Pretend to want something
awfully, then cry off for her sake.	231.11360211071107
Flatters them.	48.58276040143106
What harm?	167.46957728582615
Must since she came
to the use of reason, he, he and he.	93.85495213883945
First kiss does the trick.	195.56547244331847
The
propitious moment.	408.16086782490373
Something inside them goes pop.	381.22476531259014
Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly.	147.28147159012133
First thoughts are best.	223.31544460136368
Remember that till
their dying day.	174.37198616110612
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
Moorish wall beside the gardens.	341.7738990097735
Fifteen she told me.	98.28290116733717
But her breasts
were developed.	318.6679187943303
Fell asleep then.	189.19906060864204
After Glencree dinner that was when
we drove home.	281.00874223806846
Featherbed mountain.	161.76296858172455
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	136.01784110692134
Val Dillon.	203.15938669399281
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	107.71002502330678
My fireworks.	226.01928839956565
Up
like a rocket, down like a stick.	153.618174243089
And the children, twins they must be,
waiting for something to happen.	208.4263541238111
Want to be grownups.	141.42799440399722
Dressing in
mother’s clothes.	118.87222224496153
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	122.65327985980896
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	139.12639834627694
I knew she
could whistle.	219.37932768446237
Mouth made for that.	73.13022588007492
Like Molly.	203.15938669399281
Why that highclass
whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.	273.06490636644077
Would you mind,
please, telling me the right time?	173.26750967933953
I’ll tell you the right time up a
dark lane.	144.39611416130575
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for
fat lips.	611.0178157284038
Caressing the little boy too.	102.34418868667228
Onlookers see most of the game.	101.30321319867717
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	537.6344649426665
In their line.	128.33161152703437
Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.	147.14255647954147
Wouldn’t give that
satisfaction.	166.14703033703046
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	432.1070522243663
Fine eyes she had, clear.	158.1818769388053
It’s the white of the eye brings that out not
so much the pupil.	122.87533482350273
Did she know what I?	173.93704719704004
Like a cat sitting
beyond a dog’s jump.	250.4429862587492
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high
school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	217.39976386969965
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	282.91622974185634
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	374.08622755358607
Eyes all over them.	84.6353587249905
Look under the bed for what’s not there.	93.98758886095867
Longing to get the fright of
their lives.	125.53498629837954
Sharp as needles they are.	171.9040613224503
When I said to Molly the man at
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm.	227.29482032714472
Had, too.	56.16717052284047
Where do they get that?	94.2131531479609
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings.	265.91816462753343
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	213.0960838356534
Bred in the bone.	65.34335544464146
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the
mirror to save the ironing.	229.22843361373373
Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye
on a mirror.	154.25884686310468
And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to
Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her
stocking! Clever little minx.	365.7201580419768
I never told her.	117.52410322636305
Neat way she carries
parcels too.	325.78256626751795
Attract men, small thing like that.	171.17954694221572
Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	166.60891234126706
Who did you
learn that from?	117.65763531885094
Something the nurse taught me.	171.19495298540397
O, don’t they
know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just
before we left Lombard street west.	304.1251401474843
Me have a nice pace.	152.37661005436706
Who
knows?	105.53615530262273
Ways of the world.	37.93394181205637
Young student.	161.75487270836388
Straight on her pins anyway
not like the other.	152.94086111480885
Still she was game.	120.34297161779962
Lord, I am wet.	397.42680396778485
Devil you are.	57.31904088463169
Swell of her calf.	98.11895057241624
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	396.38506650628614
Not like that frump today.	230.28768288377194
Rumpled stockings.	167.46678341378342
Or the one in
Grafton street.	106.94775212333313
Wow! Beef to the heel.	141.77640396333504
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	1398.4268857663258
Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads.	498.4036409247111
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the
rocks.	214.53586348143602
Will she?	39.93019424155908
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	655.4870983709562
She smelt an onion.	448.20852597013
Darling, I saw, your.	249.3853390147635
I saw all.	87.25962302603546
Did me good all the same.	80.42830069664267
Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.	291.1550819732688
For
this relief much thanks.	323.37680026249393
In _Hamlet,_ that is.	108.92334104189429
Lord! It was all things
combined.	311.2621590619292
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of
my tongue.	240.49413147669807
Your head it simply swirls.	250.15459800448352
He’s right.	65.80044832232244
Might have made a
worse fool of myself however.	224.04131999881633
Instead of talking about nothing.	132.24633639714557
Then I
will tell you all.	180.32005809960808
Still it was a kind of language between us.	120.2143341831841
It
couldn’t be?	131.9499656699298
No, Gerty they called her.	194.1546369934554
Might be false name however
like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.	233.85351231730553
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
	485.1764344243198
And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	171.2755274699608
Place made me think of that I suppose.	179.88001545579993
All tarred with the same brush.	239.25322443351047
Wiping pens in their stockings.	256.6591742680586
But the ball rolled down to her as if
it understood.	149.45006369269586
Every bullet has its billet.	560.5506414965486
Course I never could throw
anything straight at school.	435.97307026209666
Crooked as a ram’s horn.	177.8675854238793
Sad however
because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby
when they hold him out to do ah ah.	317.3155948691784
No soft job.	238.81447455482828
Saves them.	48.58276040143106
Keeps them
out of harm’s way.	115.89812936150301
Washing child, washing corpse.	487.1319913271256
Children’s hands always round them.	145.89262570379998
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	547.9287181932099
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	261.69679328371893
Fill it up
with wind.	93.81147438546488
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	494.0867752080217
Must call to the hospital.	100.9092763271122
Wonder is
nurse Callan there still.	277.03521129586096
She used to look over some nights when Molly
was in the Coffee Palace.	261.3720448739164
That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her
brushing his coat.	646.8423304125491
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City
Arms.	229.13794030171894
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	288.9574535825828
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	180.91176226348523
Then ask in
the morning: was I drunk last night?	213.77741336994328
Bad policy however to fault the
husband.	247.560938194746
Chickens come home to roost.	221.28192181165286
They stick by one another like
glue.	264.74539763151915
Maybe the women’s fault also.	146.91981222261515
That’s where Molly can knock spots
off them.	336.1006120305988
It’s the blood of the south.	66.93316898425456
Also the form, the
figure.	81.23119263509815
Hands felt for the opulent.	132.61446991796993
Just compare for instance those
others.	332.8710973904352
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	250.64320449180215
Allow me to
introduce my.	130.54851975953233
Always see a fellow’s weak point in his
wife.	141.77052033327936
Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love.	145.4658363668571
Have their own
secrets between them.	239.19662196866147
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman
didn’t take them in hand.	161.41170131821275
Then little chits of girls, height of a
shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	304.09148377792116
As God made them he matched
them.	281.95678136952114
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	266.43387751091103
Twice nought makes one.	268.7461674272058
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	339.81266917540023
Marry in May and repent
in December.	229.21408648261436
This wet is very unpleasant.	291.0909360208867
Well the foreskin is
not back.	141.81870200816263
Better detach.	365.4416887200119
Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	194.7669710405664
Long and the
short of it.	50.584555853841756
Big he and little she.	58.83843152856332
Very strange about my watch.	209.39482477009523
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	218.33385323308812
Wonder is there any magnetic
influence between the person because that was about the time he.	163.3693028122714
Yes, I
suppose, at once.	258.91437178536586
Cat’s away, the mice will play.	185.10944252633834
I remember looking in
Pill lane.	307.6476110016073
Also that now is magnetism.	155.02392988723915
Back of everything magnetism.	217.57182211653796
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	244.29505848745703
That causes movement.	499.42166517428853
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.	123.1442329342442
Because it’s all
arranged.	111.21213368787944
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the
stars.	162.56739208436304
Little piece of steel iron.	289.17400100060496
When you hold out the fork.	131.6912339804068
Woman and man that is.	56.761784842901065
Fork and steel.	96.4608587873067
Dress up
and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if
you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look
and if you have any guts in you.	155.7153004068343
Have to let fly.	137.2013808046493
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	159.17171267923774
Shame all put on before third
person.	210.09954173508802
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	156.04528246521488
Molly, her underjaw
stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
the horse show.	228.33826622190173
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	245.80105131117227
Fine
voice that fellow had.	119.1412868295942
Smell that I did.	157.49940499268365
Like
flowers.	139.78897446460476
It was too.	61.35592122092196
Came from the turpentine probably in the
paint.	178.12409492615896
Make their own use of everything.	177.41058086655545
Same time doing it scraped her
slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.	232.7245258112445
But lots of them can’t kick
the beam, I think.	300.75242704384164
Keep that thing up for hours.	129.51669203471977
Kind of a general all
round over me and half down my back.	124.61779520007265
That’s her perfume.	102.68172394033094
I leave
you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.	185.42029583869723
What is it?	44.73630436839303
Roses, I think.	272.42615053825347
She’d like scent of that
kind.	162.08141113571523
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	316.58127077373064
Why Molly likes opoponax.	842.9312472393789
Suits her,
with a little jessamine mixed.	179.01103011562762
Her high notes and her low notes.	261.29834163333805
At the
dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	155.58116794095275
Heat brought it out.	97.2398086960348
She
was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	106.19168547037106
Good
conductor, is it?	140.97582069561062
Light too.	56.16717052284047
Suppose there’s some connection.	160.8116523610271
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.	190.95851693835334
Mysterious thing
too.	106.9534409639416
Why did I smell it only now?	241.31555135310074
Took its time in coming like herself,
slow but sure.	233.18463139689646
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown
across.	348.09711468584
Yes, it is.	44.17687065229445
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
morning, smell them leagues off.	606.3128423498023
Tell you what it is.	60.92225741255647
It’s like a fine
fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as
anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	253.12597821110538
Vamp of her stockings.	87.27914007466711
Warm shoe.	226.026831156834
Drawers: little
kick, taking them off.	250.40863609886577
Byby till next time.	194.26898144903635
Also the cat likes to sniff
in her shift on the bed.	167.90551946228356
Know her smell in a thousand.	111.1465002373153
Bathwater too.	56.16717052284047
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	138.1604499550198
Wonder where it is really.	118.05586129019068
There
or the armpits or under the neck.	131.3465578165451
Because you get it out of all holes
and corners.	140.5069163186506
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	248.409156815922
Bag under their tails.	213.40135201068142
One grain pour off odour for years.	462.75390132954084
Dogs at each other behind.	161.2202341795896
Good evening.	114.43820905442307
How do you sniff?	186.7546091586467
Very well, thank you.	144.7057540601785
Animals go by that.	75.39386051427653
Yes now, look at it that
way.	106.07264634064518
We’re the same.	80.90337080019665
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have
their period.	292.84572457889925
Come near.	89.7308842152844
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	224.18222934984294
Potted herrings gone stale or.	412.3688649920169
Boof! Please keep off the
grass.	261.400086344746
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	152.7076430431079
Cigary gloves long
John had on his desk the other day.	215.61378873326862
What you eat and drink
gives that.	162.33491730483854
Mansmell, I mean.	318.2273266418063
Must be connected with that because
priests that are supposed to be are different.	216.88291370183612
Women buzz round it like
flies round treacle.	410.8465780841557
The
tree of forbidden priest.	339.0287654528306
O, father, will you?	94.7567708096308
Let me be the first to.	61.038080316735375
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	398.68140590542
Source of life.	52.44132298153246
And it’s extremely curious the smell.	182.22182605798713
Let me.	43.12221257392657
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	365.1610141732982
Into the.	16.546858522534237
Opening of his waistcoat.	70.38423342400402
Almonds or.	41.9124655648472
Lemons it is.	44.17687065229445
O by the by that lotion.	86.46154240975712
Never
went back and the soap not paid.	144.2405947490365
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag
this morning.	369.5734545479819
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	206.01565569825723
I could
mention Meagher’s just to remind him.	254.80712817355837
Still if he works that paragraph.	161.1671799484739
Two and nine.	76.50422778457208
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.	120.59289586225434
How much do
I owe you?	332.69716198989636
Three and nine?	76.50422778457208
Two and nine, sir.	112.91103016539128
Might stop him giving
credit another time.	370.11382271730764
Pubs do.	55.71292897014647
Fellows run
up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into
somewhere else.	267.6161714698471
Here’s this nobleman passed before.	225.00417674441405
Blown in from the bay.	69.0299571444106
Just went as
far as turn back.	187.1640780177405
Always at home at dinnertime.	220.76306814018136
Looks mangled out: had
a good tuck in.	222.76929987311348
Enjoying nature now.	137.96550494511362
Grace after meals.	208.42648815622758
After supper
walk a mile.	311.9585496032673
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government
sit.	368.7639471674431
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	262.9214714254009
See ourselves as others see us.	257.8367113125265
So long as
women don’t mock what matter?	265.6056086028486
That’s the way to find out.	76.4209864853431
Ask yourself
who is he now.	122.61567273558722
_The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr
Leopold Bloom.	730.4880201345417
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.	216.78179788110634
And that
fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	173.5981189170652
Corns on his
kismet however.	189.61315389477286
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	179.03712057392679
Whistle brings rain
they say.	271.6720688802306
Must be some somewhere.	149.93163026366466
Salt in the Ormond damp.	159.64756919534534
The body
feels the atmosphere.	272.6700174377562
Old Betty’s joints are on the rack.	251.4003865375966
Mother
Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the
twinkling.	282.3989994391682
Signs of rain it is.	79.27095495288145
The royal reader.	471.6216308693101
Bailey light.	89.98788735581832
Two, four, six, eight, nine.	446.00394580860467
Has to change or
they might think it a house.	130.10293316550278
Grace Darling.	203.15938669399281
People afraid of
the dark.	85.89559412625952
Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time.	1140.9955252992163
Jewels diamonds
flash better.	551.7944775839808
Light is a kind of reassuring.	127.96688858760511
Not going to hurt
you.	124.37006138805226
Better now of course than long ago.	161.68149467751218
Country roads.	287.40150812754337
Still two types there are you bob against.	249.21945204856266
Scowl or smile.	123.54737607640692
Pardon! Not at all.	144.97942108729924
Some light still.	147.1835791319832
Red rays are longest.	421.1412548798548
Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
violet.	828.7680793436109
A star I see.	368.96914263417756
Can’t tell yet.	161.373264934181
When three it’s
night.	96.14564523519171
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	155.63361064010635
Looks like a phantom
ship.	212.00993499743745
Trees are they?	69.07460521413789
An optical illusion.	913.1713403192209
Land of
the setting sun this.	123.74355992638647
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	237.6069288667993
My native
land, goodnight.	678.3729718593197
Dew falling.	152.28278157433402
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.	133.76636847925585
Brings on white
fluxions.	234.55625072885903
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his
way up through.	244.49451879913462
Might get piles myself.	378.3132836474636
Sticks too like a summer cold,
sore on the mouth.	178.0717575871239
Cut with grass or paper worst.	274.93099043508306
Like to be that rock she sat on.	119.48057549058319
O sweet little, you don’t
know how nice you looked.	204.95748125637502
I begin to like them at that age.	148.79416426889932
Green
apples.	287.40150812754337
Grab at all that offer.	119.93069775048775
Suppose it’s the only time we cross
legs, seated.	184.7101249768773
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	323.72502645881696
Happy
chairs under them.	229.164581003465
But it’s the evening influence.	104.92587636940543
They feel all that.	86.15832352558044
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,
in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	766.1228682582893
Nightstock in Mat
Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	415.50133691124273
Wish I had a full length
oilpainting of her then.	245.2458535533585
June that was too I wooed.	256.5238445572322
The year returns.	312.2833337250261
History repeats itself.	412.9984755485351
Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.	338.6105405977878
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	325.19880991288176
And now?	56.330396450281164
Sad about her
lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	212.1526873932986
They take advantage.	300.76298872895336
All quiet on Howth now.	245.5345250239246
The distant hills seem.	640.9390626624714
Where we.	54.95620389526568
The
rhododendrons.	236.72887101340675
I am a fool perhaps.	179.18526021316575
He gets the plums, and I the
plumstones.	241.56148659565892
All that old hill has seen.	204.37577561116305
Names change:
that’s all.	87.83584295966594
Lovers: yum yum.	831.4989823123084
Tired I feel now.	274.2655556096745
Will I get up?	209.52490181962952
O wait.	88.86839359446913
Drained all the manhood out of
me, little wretch.	159.78558151818748
She kissed me.	144.74656173705566
Never again.	69.07159083352626
My youth.	141.3356023164092
Only once it
comes.	142.95482140825985
Or hers.	186.169138097563
Take the train there tomorrow.	161.53302122561593
Returning not the
same.	56.42392533503562
Like kids your second visit to a house.	237.84975948758316
The new I want.	308.64420849362676
Nothing
new under the sun.	116.40287779881007
Care of P.	106.7296495237354
Dolphin’s Barn.	136.70385447397808
Are you not happy in
your?	104.29288913236547
Naughty darling.	156.73716971662776
At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s
house.	416.0721825121357
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,
Louy, Hetty.	722.9215555382126
Molly too.	56.16717052284047
Eightyseven that was.	39.74782755067457
Year before we.	102.73123428163697
And the
old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	205.59954587477844
Curious she an only child, I
an only child.	276.0939559988578
So it returns.	136.85810586925948
Think you’re escaping and run into
yourself.	254.35162952264076
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	204.09809716453336
And just when he
and she.	72.42971952636645
Circus horse walking in a ring.	164.59517140299482
Rip van Winkle we played.	495.2302156184493
Rip:
tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat.	420.8062509545689
Van: breadvan delivering.	824.7533730312146
Winkle:
cockles and periwinkles.	332.1092947382866
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	637.6027020342963
She
leaned on the sideboard watching.	246.77415249891982
Moorish eyes.	62.2820201442977
Twenty years asleep in
Sleepy Hollow.	430.4202664055221
All changed.	156.74239962289175
The young are old.	122.36048565333515
His gun rusty
from the dew.	331.33131697441354
What is that flying about?	128.09756918277395
Bat probably.	135.4939018501051
Thinks I’m a
tree, so blind.	271.18657350699897
Have birds no smell?	260.7693014211068
They believed you
could be changed into a tree from grief.	272.32827443630214
Weeping willow.	317.5334699131929
There he
goes.	84.74824631783308
Funny little beggar.	217.80029943794145
Wonder where he lives.	127.82450519119895
Belfry up there.	67.05221430768452
Very
likely.	209.19524368391612
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	142.21450176484225
Bell scared him
out, I suppose.	339.277642264102
Mass seems to be over.	114.0488599856392
Could hear them all at it.	97.91441162949044
Pray
for us.	69.93346423208226
And pray for us.	142.7101312958528
And pray for us.	142.7101312958528
Good idea the repetition.	191.96634107982345
Same thing with ads.	171.67058624504438
Buy from us.	81.62036090152415
And buy from us.	164.3750985701089
Yes, there’s the
light in the priest’s house.	83.4091053720755
Their frugal meal.	892.785883734412
Remember about the
mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s.	173.27119177608648
Twentyeight it is.	44.17687065229445
Two
houses they have.	144.27854120938593
Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate.	302.28613378590757
Wonder
why they come out at night like mice.	204.9662947391525
They’re a mixed breed.	289.0120485672974
Birds are
like hopping mice.	382.97051308362535
What frightens them, light or noise?	403.90046679589227
Better sit
still.	192.09809686614753
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of
a jar by throwing in pebbles.	210.0478460541994
Like a little man in a cloak he is with
tiny hands.	130.73272144261938
Weeny bones.	156.73455501773446
Colours depend on the light you see.	146.65780683593772
Stare the sun for example
like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	287.3631110997308
Wants
to stamp his trademark on everything.	212.95101188695642
Instance, that cat this morning
on the staircase.	145.17305684058414
Colour of brown turf.	174.32164408052103
Say you never see them with
three colours.	168.74659718238814
Not true.	111.14407210722105
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the
_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	321.30423588434263
Body fifty different
colours.	497.1154212212713
Howth a while ago amethyst.	276.3492315620598
Glass flashing.	226.02305965594886
That’s how that
wise man what’s his name with the burning glass.	147.60049654831192
Then the heather goes
on fire.	207.12176201617322
It can’t be tourists’ matches.	331.5687536768413
Perhaps the sticks dry
rub together in the wind and light.	205.82465336423962
Or broken bottles in the furze act
as a burning glass in the sun.	219.3698993171506
I have it! My memory’s not
so bad.	198.96627531372334
Who knows what they’re always flying for.	223.00007760537062
That bee last
week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	256.47007346366007
Birds too.	56.16717052284047
Never find out.	114.51670576417415
Or what
they say.	88.85825469643144
Like our small talk.	264.2623042736172
Nerve they
have to fly over the ocean and back.	129.93393640395985
Lots must be killed in storms,
telegraph wires.	470.4602409782946
Dreadful life sailors have too.	234.94074522426675
Big brutes of
oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like
seacows.	451.2429170697188
_Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in
vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake
when the stormy winds do blow.	330.7612074719416
Married too.	56.16717052284047
Sometimes away for years at
the ends of the earth somewhere.	129.5734042088482
No ends really because it’s round.	203.01630395648385
Wife in every port they say.	172.64810826447984
If ever he does.	111.42052012490504
Smelling the tail
end of ports.	197.7687468671336
How can they like the sea?	94.9601085163663
Yet they do.	72.04379292978177
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	195.66437710721956
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on
his door to touch.	166.28956805525337
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into
the house of bondage.	127.38190874986573
Something in all those superstitions because when
you go out never know what dangers.	233.571527681336
Hanging on to a plank or astride of
a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and
that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	249.5817444917701
Do fish
ever get seasick?	450.5722114578395
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,
crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so
peaceful.	605.8453765784196
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	340.67067263719116
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of
funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of
violet but one white stars.	393.99191254889865
They floated, fell: they faded.	429.3559996610491
The
shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	283.28341825158816
From house to
house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock
postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there
through the laurel hedges.	367.4904903682146
And among the five young trees a hoisted
lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace.	376.52065162881024
By screens of lighted
windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening
Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from
the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called.	412.7112369921261
Twittering the bat
flew here, flew there.	286.6193308511577
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,
grey.	299.3242458851506
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum
rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,
ruffle his fell of ferns.	375.29097454487965
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep
and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	508.8309567867201
And far on Kish bank the
anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	771.9705744307513
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	203.64422289951003
Irish
Lights board.	445.6969501808581
Penance for their sins.	140.1300566827935
Coastguards too.	56.16717052284047
Rocket and
breeches buoy and lifeboat.	315.7243881057436
Bears in the
zoo.	86.84661371415672
Filthy trip.	317.5334699131929
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	196.4666843220865
Puking
overboard to feed the herrings.	316.2916334323888
And the women, fear of God in
their faces.	165.2726986730316
Milly, no sign of funk.	217.95443189379722
Don’t know what death is at that age.	147.08065646471817
And then their stomachs clean.	286.2666496766585
But being lost they fear.	225.70905809171535
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	276.2760305376673
I
didn’t want to.	123.28928390003306
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	229.72582110979107
Frightening them with
masks too.	174.6079986912576
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	96.26668118425285
I’ll murder you.	160.77022695175344
Is it only half fun?	202.44747571511047
Or children playing battle.	505.9669958996595
Whole earnest.	249.71993668557914
How can
people aim guns at each other.	410.3642908906539
Sometimes they go off.	110.06691125293482
Poor kids! Only
troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	1034.2769328705851
Calomel purge I got her for that.	271.40223589998686
After getting better asleep with Molly.	375.3464065474509
Very same teeth she has.	183.8548326367249
What
do they love?	112.27404377240998
Another themselves?	118.12613677020784
But the morning she chased her with
the umbrella.	131.37911664130118
I felt her pulse.	274.6496903571582
Little hand it was: now big.	114.25022627159439
Dearest Papli.	203.15938669399281
All that the hand says when
you touch.	104.78619239544281
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	293.44652891799575
Her first stays I
remember.	483.73652191105685
Made me laugh to see.	112.78179090061288
Little paps to begin with.	240.3817790169715
Left one is
more sensitive, I think.	310.3554766247204
Mine too.	56.16717052284047
Nearer the heart?	51.18000516439252
Padding themselves
out if fat is in fashion.	193.92186566803446
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening
me.	567.3133475947872
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	126.75497010872267
Poor child!
Strange moment for the mother too.	209.03205869011904
Brings back her girlhood.	195.00115703426405
Looking from Buena Vista.	346.1586942176387
O’Hara’s tower.	249.07579331726015
The seabirds screaming.	781.3018098669372
Sundown, gunfire for the men
to cross the lines.	166.57984523753336
Looking out over the sea she told me.	111.771878982795
Evening like
this, but clear, no clouds.	245.77912925589627
_Buenas noches, señorita.	863.0200044997456
El
hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	2101.147596902376
Why me?	43.12221257392657
Because you were so foreign
from the others.	137.16808816682544
This weather makes you
dull.	325.5930515380581
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	129.69826296325516
Go home.	89.43071292324764
Too late for
_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No.	382.14586335014553
Might be still up.	102.43866910834909
Call to the hospital
to see.	72.35688698221853
Hope she’s over.	68.15519923898447
Long day I’ve had.	328.2098837129558
Martha, the bath, funeral,
house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song.	416.6160386242109
Then that
bawler in Barney Kiernan’s.	290.37593326720673
Got my own back there.	128.29029372956776
Drunken ranters what
I said about his God made him wince.	419.47415845878845
Mistake to hit back.	142.02493793465808
Ought
to go home and laugh at themselves.	156.41189577623604
Always want to be swilling in
company.	180.9600627404782
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	104.52661857507385
Suppose he hit me.	121.99810465458128
Look at it other way round.	118.26295698596934
Not so bad then.	131.53147785232937
Perhaps not to hurt he
meant.	143.12816261987285
Three cheers for Israel.	307.8998906457215
Three cheers for the sister-in-law he
hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	236.91483254343197
Same style of beauty.	167.32053374740343
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	177.28657358231243
The sister of the wife of
the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	150.52371189417232
Imagine that in the early
morning at close range.	188.05174577968435
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he
kissed the cow.	177.7358860971718
But Dignam’s put the boots on it.	129.6544880827647
Houses of mourning so
depressing because you never know.	225.79362442587322
Anyhow she wants the money.	111.12150457783437
Must
call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	442.6037865647941
Strange name.	71.84248504265817
That widow on Monday was it
outside Cramer’s that looked at me.	218.0786050023723
Buried the poor husband but
progressing favourably on the premium.	285.5640793500951
Her widow’s mite.	283.94522754195054
What do
you expect her to do?	121.06094805340543
Must wheedle her way along.	286.60678243335656
Widower I hate to
see.	214.4612169153842
Looks so forlorn.	231.15480156798924
Poor man O’Connor wife and five children
poisoned by mussels here.	480.0365294872272
The sewage.	266.003957838601
Some good matronly
woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	229.39813576103418
Take him in tow, platter face and
a large apron.	255.9570667992592
Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a
pair, astonishing bargain.	767.6295621912
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	178.6355730014875
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	154.03173697411847
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we
die.	252.84048274462728
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the
trick.	242.21802595239876
p: up.	44.5676377971097
Fate that is.	43.620860083286054
He, not me.	63.0292641338204
Also a shop often noticed.	269.43772245382894
Curse seems to dog it.	135.78073285379267
Dreamt last night?	124.05326533406505
Something confused.	287.39671252413314
She
had red slippers on.	187.34859179027762
Wore the breeches.	85.64344978604882
Suppose she does?	97.9722098316416
Damned hard to answer.	145.3742230294098
Nannetti’s gone.	81.13213681790569
Near Holyhead by now.	176.94655868179797
Must nail that ad of Keyes’s.	217.04235570666893
Work
Hynes and Crawford.	249.5976425755857
Petticoats for Molly.	148.84243288685786
She has something to put in
them.	107.91377658888315
What’s that?	37.77232725523974
Might be money.	104.64356974576499
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	198.27096895739786
He
brought it near his eyes and peered.	154.60730547342385
Can’t read.	108.91228759641365
Better go.	70.02961323970501
I’m tired to move.	217.53596323569406
Page of an old copybook.	137.3937105402948
All those holes and
pebbles.	272.29540067152334
Who could count them?	213.0746667947766
Never know what you find.	121.88873227784121
Bottle with
story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	170.3172230487848
Parcels post.	164.5297731254354
Children
always want to throw things in the sea.	141.7784993263839
What’s this?	56.41260031384637
Bit of stick.	79.87114426452028
O! Exhausted that female has me.	219.44795946758217
Not so young now.	121.85184398450482
Will she come here
tomorrow?	183.45066431199564
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	119.35313723196167
Must come back.	103.4207039257074
Murderers
do.	55.71292897014647
Will I?	203.15938669399281
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	299.87852199183345
Write
a message for her.	102.82992871940921
Might remain.	191.01580163668595
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	169.5764448290174
Washed away.	76.49013325525952
Saw a pool near her foot.	202.61620249129192
Bend, see my face there, dark
mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	287.38901736833026
All these rocks with lines and scars and
letters.	271.5089716197389
O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know.	291.44923213813814
I called you naughty boy because I do not
like.	279.75318369894393
No room.	118.93370105994484
Let it go.	68.94026680195883
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	341.5338941732058
Hopeless thing sand.	194.94134299634885
Nothing grows in it.	111.05075633010395
All fades.	365.4416887200119
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	264.03446002685257
Except Guinness’s barges.	364.4108208106787
Round the Kish in eighty days.	219.6090193945472
Done half by
design.	197.82896454547696
He flung his wooden pen away.	407.90382031596437
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	471.971267692199
Now
if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t.	144.68753047878383
We’ll never meet again.	225.15856783981218
But it was lovely.	82.13026711558669
Goodbye, dear.	100.45866139570049
Made
me feel so young.	150.30269230513355
Short snooze now if I had.	397.08175543846727
Must be near nine.	184.7895104247799
Liverpool boat long gone.	297.19729446912277
Not even the smoke.	127.62299052414782
And she can do the other.	86.44988764588129
Did too.	56.16717052284047
And Belfast.	203.15938669399281
I
won’t go.	158.28218078583083
Race there, race back to Ennis.	209.6439985197287
Let him.	36.51091131766098
Just close my eyes a
moment.	154.80363784951837
Won’t sleep, though.	180.18873486197268
Half dream.	164.52702776913503
It never comes the same.	116.49013896489868
Bat
again.	69.07159083352626
No harm in him.	102.31360870713401
Just a few.	61.449112914111275
O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me
do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed
met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair
heave under embon _señorita_ young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan
Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail
end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return
next in her next her next.	672.5782842225744
A bat flew.	445.4782858790269
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	152.19286589710404
Mr Bloom
with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	599.8526588651932
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon
O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	381.0381979787521
were
taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup
and talking about
	382.5188627481947
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to
tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there
because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that
which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in
them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain
when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being
equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have
progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when
fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent
nature’s incorrupted benefaction.	449.47239692894857
For who is there who anything of some
significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior
splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or
on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive
that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so
it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and
admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past
been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not
with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have
gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to
that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who
would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence
can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel
simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy
of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly
procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	413.7941895707961
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	337.36025869595966
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have
sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
withering or loose boyconnell flux.	555.8147882159408
Certainly in every public work
which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with
importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it
is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent
inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)
whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that
whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly
required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who
not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely
could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was
provided.	410.9429639875298
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
received into that domicile.	416.1977298055877
O thing of prudent nation not merely in
being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!

Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe

That man her will wotting worthful went in
Horne’s house.	317.67662678080177
Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	320.89584396477505
On her stow
he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over
land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	364.4355483423728
Her to forgive now he
craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,
hers, so young then had looked.	233.73554190421487
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of
blushes his word winning.	337.55795029454606
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	615.745659049487
Glad
after she was that ere adread was.	197.47488462991515
Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor
tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered
that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was.	465.2386996927748
Sad was the man that word to hear
that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	190.95656321274834
All she there told him, ruing
death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to
withsay.	531.6668121958173
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His
goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil
to his limbs.	338.0703570168943
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death
the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was
died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas
and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his
undeathliness.	252.52415353667612
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	318.02647230365795
So
stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	315.72402561876885
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman
and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in
childbed.	137.77008961843023
She said thereto that she
had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that
woman’s birth.	229.82264702036463
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew
the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	160.8210230017244
The man hearkened to
her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they
have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair
face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a
handmaid.	185.5525385153924
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	919.086679715158
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there
nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	241.90878595109356
And there
came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept
Dixon.	287.07602143919456
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed
that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where
this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a
salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	305.9740391322112
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	181.07825313633614
Also the lady
was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	209.42910308889424
But
the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a
marvellous castle.	268.6810001490741
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for
to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches
environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	382.9161160134158
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
move more for enchantment.	215.37253009969416
And on this board were frightful swords and
knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
abound marvellously.	355.1646465668256
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic
of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that
he blases in to them like to bubbles.	209.50990727100898
And full fair cheer and rich was
on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	407.07775784147094
And there
was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay
strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be
possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	315.48033097779063
And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of
the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	280.0407832824315
And
also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a
compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
to a vast mountain.	255.8907937513547
And they teach the serpents there to entwine
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	242.92391481721867
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	363.8862569638822
And childe
Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
his neighbour nist not of this wile.	314.8133195203568
And he sat down in that castle
with them for to rest him there awhile.	150.10728979548293
Thanked be Almighty God.	358.7972860994165
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing
for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time
hied fast.	390.29170335100764
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered
what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,
that it be not come or now.	205.6020977506486
And he was ware
and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was
older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him full gently.	218.35117045755786
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring
forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath
waited marvellous long.	307.38333988624436
And the franklin that had drunken said,
Expecting each moment to be her next.	220.94051543207019
Also he took the cup that stood
tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to
drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far
as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his
lustiness.	233.94188492733238
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat
in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that
ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight
of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged
him courtly in the cup.	273.20304031405817
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.	279.55336105138997
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might.	173.30573584807735
There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long
of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
beside the meek sir Leopold.	315.6148018876178
But on young Malachi they waited for that
he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
he had broke his avow.	221.53393841973448
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	303.55690219575837
Ruth red
him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	252.8341265108847
For they were right witty scholars.	329.18250365035505
And he heard their aresouns each
gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining
that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen
out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house
that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next
before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her
case).	287.08321009778825
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,
they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that
were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for
he had conscience to let her die.	247.41578363331277
And not few and of these was young
Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it
was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the
law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	275.7864451043013
A redress God grant.	1291.983381873886
This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,
the wife should live and the babe to die.	290.3863845860485
In colour whereof they waxed
hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but
the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at
the least way mirth might not lack.	341.9280516503296
Then young Madden showed all the
whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint
Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby
they were all wondrous grieved.	309.41002822804796
To whom young Stephen had these words
following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	876.5360098998258
Both babe and
parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in
purgefire.	349.7076199249076
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
God, Lord and Giver of Life?	472.19168954107823
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	303.0677580398271
We
are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends
than we.	327.8725583671793
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	524.5826240293648
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was
that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or
leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	224.50946555573177
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the
other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they
did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do.	305.2586274500269
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir
Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour
which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
whoso she might be or wheresoever.	324.04443848563085
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu
secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	332.95733813098803
He said also how at the end of the
second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother
foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother
which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he
that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which
rock was holy church for all ages founded.	344.287023936376
All they bachelors then
asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as
risk life to save life.	283.39066196987244
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
questions.	301.01890251737
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant
word.	466.5400250538207
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he
was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that
taking it appeared eftsoons.	196.7801761761383
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny.	286.8032633621586
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying
for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge
the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	320.6658171106278
Now drink
we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed
parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.	353.5513038429135
Leave ye fraction of bread to
them that live by bread alone.	265.96828147557324
Be not afeard neither for any want for
this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	310.5424437788734
See ye here.	210.3004383290611
And he
showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the
worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song
which he writ.	243.04445379201658
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such
dearth of money as was herebefore.	281.9927780906653
His words were then these as
followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s
mansions.	395.572711154621
What means this?	152.3070305675443
Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after
it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	217.88320793296302
Mark
me now.	74.5555472938712
In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the
maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	230.39005213823071
This is the postcreation.	114.10864793691071
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	1034.7131336650125
No question but
her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,
Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and
Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae
supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is
the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,
our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of
navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	480.80726223977814
But here is the matter now.	103.02859274803984
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was
but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or
she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy
with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with
Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,
_parceque M.	373.33007102914263
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	194.33704915356975
Let the lewd with faith and fervour
worship.	289.51724617255326
With will will we withstand, withsay.	434.8870979949954
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was
it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no
gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	389.6749017852884
It was an
ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in
habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of
them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness
some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,
thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou
chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the
good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,
margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and
most worthy to be most sacred.	411.4861416348751
In Horne’s house rest should reign.	410.1936309299261
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	364.79136221446885
Master
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	323.8572005937759
But he
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
the eternal son and ever virgin.	189.31676059039893
Thereat mirth grew in them the more
and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing
and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,
with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries
and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
there unmaided.	400.60273028917106
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
concent upon the virginals.	397.701485657953
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium
of connubial communion.	715.1340788290692
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	441.1110139141919
Young Stephen
said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for
life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved
with it.	218.55296440146478
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay
down his wife for his friend.	163.14374100330477
Go thou and do likewise.	203.69392547625645
Thus, or words
to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French
letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to
whom mankind was more beholden.	406.51597071045177
Bring a stranger within thy tower it
will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed.	365.4039072992951

And all the people shall say, Amen.	200.445238211885
Remember, Erin, thy
generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by
my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	292.48650416268396
Therefore hast thou
sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
servants.	307.57661599585674
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	670.3156885050516
Why
hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian
of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	372.31770551635253
Look forth
now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo
and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with
milk and money.	258.8163568766716
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon
and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	394.0517616305292
And thou hast left me alone for
ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast
thou kissed my mouth.	255.6618736110234
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to
say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much

of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and

The aged sisters draw us into
life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over
us dead they bend.	1019.0023297986718
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among
bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a
mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat
and the ossifrage.	342.3498695625093
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor
to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or
to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see
from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched
his whenceness.	340.7923830785828
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he
loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast
majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all
in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	618.7794214088299
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
	514.6997395693323
See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
	365.1796225497257
In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.	328.0365651843306
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	293.71436420982457
Loud on
left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	453.8185192390723
Came now the
storm that hist his heart.	182.09483480227917
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to
flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and
paganry.	358.72745237090516
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard
again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he
was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	283.7675363750575
But the
braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was
muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	289.4430300224822
But this was
only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.	305.16203020883745
He
drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,
being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of
doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming
words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing
but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the
thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a
natural phenomenon.	305.344783033344
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?	334.3959890418685
No, for he
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away.	222.35887742792502
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
other?	182.35111223689202
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	169.8465496288311
But
could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	217.8358058791237
Indeed no for Grace was not
there to find that bottle.	160.97393245215022
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	163.90721421472074
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
Understanding (which he had not done).	209.55178676494933
For through that tube he saw
that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one
day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	145.16075289337982
And would he not
accept to die like the rest and pass away?	162.0181225457957
By no means would he though
he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives
which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	285.97577212812286
Then wotted
he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the
land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for
ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering
at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	266.3830477005272
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
know her.	236.4255358949751
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but
notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
named Killchild.	335.6882202039391
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	950.8556087255627
Wherein, O wretched company,
were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill
their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	304.32872258262137
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	1120.483529832457
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields
athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	551.611041575878
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without
sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	284.32911243340084
The
rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought
but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	399.23443013900106
All the world
saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that
did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	285.55401206476927
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in
the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and
the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first
and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder
and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the
smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
pour came.	315.6424905529369
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through
Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no
more crack after that first.	398.4715101647253
Mr Justice
Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the
college lands) Mal.	382.5424157495508
Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come
from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a
good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	264.95294007760145
Bannon in a cut bob (which are
now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a
month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup
of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
so both together on to Horne’s.	242.48791130712306
There Leop.	203.15938669399281
Bloom of Crawford’s journal
sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon
jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin.	537.8464183250402
Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.	290.62480103738716
Madden, T.	203.15938669399281
Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	360.6911750674657
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having
dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers
on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be
for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading
her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,
the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of
riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very
heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they
say, but God give her soon issue.	271.17093302072044
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,
and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth
and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand
in the king’s bible.	268.18472010051227
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the
sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys
off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in
a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,
I hear.	337.30989886158443
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and
will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and
water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I
hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out
of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in
all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and
bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their
queerities no telling how.	328.25987640210184
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the
letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about
him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk.	183.07238767456306
He was a kind of sport gentleman
that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of
women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	278.52697398477244
To tell the truth he
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues
of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at
nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much
loose gossip.	396.52599161756734
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but
gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a
bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his
tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
mother’s son of them would burst their sides.	271.0915189094493
Faith, no, he
says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to
be butchered along of the plague.	217.81924886184146
But they can go hang, says he with a
wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	204.06982866541043
There’s as good fish
in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take
of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the
meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
embassy as he was sharpset.	222.8522222697682
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the
French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a
winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	306.09742171416895
From a
child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,
who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of
the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but
he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	231.42616233198146
He had been off as many times
as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to
his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw
him.	224.48741119777702
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to
know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	212.57037692895696
I can scarce
believe ’tis so bad, says he.	314.41008881757733
And he had experience of the like brood
beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.	526.0474218328613
I question with you there, says he.	102.22777865496207
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	255.4371219668618
Mr Stephen, a little
moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had
dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the
hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted
cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the
bull by the horns.	290.78186441351903
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	684.4348166123548
He’ll
find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s
Irish, says he.	182.25161526831678
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and
he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	361.6475585122286
I
conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	489.61574993608826
It is that same bull that was sent to our
island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with
an emerald ring in his nose.	249.94940211981014
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the
table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a
portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	241.81655251130877
He had horns galore, a
coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his
nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	301.5367086049526
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself.	282.16397354470934
So be off now, says he, and do all my
cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing,
and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	238.94546640397073
But the slap and
the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess
and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the
month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the
nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	236.26613463933418
Another then put in his
word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his
forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables
for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of
the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart’s content.	236.91738601118576
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	197.9907295972432
To
remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in
their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on
his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow
out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.	287.91533944903534
Ay, says another,
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
grass that grows on the ground.	195.32312548340582
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a
husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or
a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.	306.4332185971709
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the
lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in
his matters, says he.	283.30369671416065
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	207.4643793992051
But one evening, says
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to
dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he
found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
boss of the show.	282.3624308457396
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	214.03047547674996
Then, with the
water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language
to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if
ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	218.96308420994345
In short, he and the bull of Ireland
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	217.9139765742945
They were, says Mr
Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was
toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,
loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all
masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread
three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times
three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea
to recover the main of America.	384.3687467542573
Which was the occasion, says Mr
Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
	260.5867225149892
_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.	308.56870312655263
A man’s a man for a’ that._
	61.816752301552505
Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	341.4841688125411
Mr Mulligan was civil
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on.	178.12447639170003
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	353.7313957622247
Fertiliser and
Incubator.	109.91965027550245
Lambay Island_.	203.15938669399281
His project, as he went on to expound, was
to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief
business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has
been framed.	321.36696878047394
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	245.27799847858552
I
make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	332.6081753064039
Come, be seated, both.	202.86036654696392
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,
expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into
this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the
inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from
proclivities acquired.	326.63252558051005
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the
nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so
many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest
bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty
fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart
weep.	433.0064419158469
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
ascendancy party.	456.2112963007196
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
natural.	309.6928751766771
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
his pains.	168.62383151287145
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of
fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	374.2755968964789
For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies.	435.32264763957164
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
with which he had shielded it.	292.94472851248594
They both, it seems, had been overtaken
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which
was now somewhat piebald.	344.84468338249064
His project meanwhile was very favourably
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	433.7576375830488
Mr Mulligan however made
court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as
it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of
his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut
matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
farmyard drake and duck.	751.7928083977059
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced.	309.42019205716963
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour.	267.48157555155143
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give?	283.1177073677203
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	293.88190235487303
Mr
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
stomach.	409.72034360901387
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,
smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex
though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a
bastard.	461.42684390766595
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth
and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	266.277738503429
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some
larum in the antechamber.	293.8492774100332
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was
ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	279.21887959738854
_Mais bien
sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	1276.7720206288561
That
you may and very opportunely.	185.09844273706585
There wanted nothing but this cup to
crown my felicity.	322.9801317196174
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
of good things.	235.49766672912307
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening
his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	331.27050636396723
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands
of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	361.9325240444135
I declare, I was never
so touched in all my life.	243.27431717961
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
favours.	359.16553150852025
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	296.6592895536806
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished
coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of
maturer years.	328.9251954738293
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	323.0870732722317
How mingled
and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	485.39745065410756
Maledicity! he exclaimed in
anguish.	217.0737913914261
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	276.6881018154657
Then, though it had poured
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	252.8848250116609
But beshrew me,
he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day
and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur
Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the
French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	384.8277567375336
Tut, tut! cries Le
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
the stoutest cloak.	482.27363955913603
Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.	919.2000720911623
The
clumsy things are dear at a sou.	325.865369360738
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a
fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	469.0662304566073
No woman of any wit would
wear one.	226.21690069505377
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge
before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she
reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there
was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the
divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is
the fittest, nay, the only garment.	356.0350288734471
The first, said she (and here my
pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),
the first is a bath...	267.51414315089755
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall
cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of
our store of knowledge.	301.83871957926016
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
a profound bow to the company.	325.7797887112647
The presence even for a moment among a
party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
ribaldry.	330.9798032651217
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	299.7111981610222
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused
you.	524.0515760033538
What, you dog?	97.64867563423809
Have you a way with them?	70.02419573729256
Gad’s bud, immensely so,
said Mr Lynch.	500.3518378204352
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
hospice.	262.53851193034717
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
chin.	442.38083861562745
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been
wardmaid there any time these seven months.	371.18752949495365
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried
the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and
with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the
man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.	352.40043460800666
Why, you’re as bad as dear
little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half
choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	320.00891226924557
I knows a lady
what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	256.5683817550277
The young
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	234.25342100272175
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	257.3493562761683
I want patience,
said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence
due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	369.67458265198354
I
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
breast.	340.0771502416959
I cannot away with them.	168.33171960688554
Malign such an one, the amiable
Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of
ours?	244.25883002342516
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child
of clay?	286.80231387701957
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race
where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right
reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	246.56324997972803
Having
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door.	189.43382619799422
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were
for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have
been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had
he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of
the true fold as ever drew breath.	307.87717825307465
Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
back on with a loving heart.	287.9401031559417
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	345.89566435619037
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	456.0641056726313
But the word of Mr
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	288.8368390535783
It was
now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had
passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a
wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his
heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting
them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that
plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	359.5683153886581
To those who create
themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which
he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the
name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such
that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a
precipitate and inglorious retreat.	342.34926849819016
Not but what he could feel with
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy
Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far
forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	341.73688894651167
To conclude, while
from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence
that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the
Supreme Being.	276.28986763386587
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	254.6386479182811
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
matron.	254.2997314483129
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table
so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum
was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
calls her.	347.6527867260286
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event
would burst anon.	321.2942485369469
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.	165.39412681968042
I cannot but extol
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her.	282.7266793318944
All fell to praising of it, each after his own
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that
another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed
in every household.	310.4282717045372
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
eminent have esteemed the noblest.	460.91315621832257
But, he further added, it is mayhap
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	363.89267679972164
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity?	381.0799751298458
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled?	374.42904291088246
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents?	277.99242742887293
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	279.96730452925704
Or is
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	211.55958010923015
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	238.00705771759038
Unhappy
woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than
the derision of the desperate.	314.33772628674114
He says this, a censor of morals, a very
pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of
nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush
not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with
Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from
an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as
straightforward as they were bucolic.	394.9712784505545
It ill becomes him to preach that
gospel.	314.3560375062758
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the
want of the ploughshare?	218.80476894125428
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second
nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	402.6231314469095
If he must dispense his balm
of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to
health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
better with the doctrines that now engross him.	416.36873224010566
His marital breast is
the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	426.15849610828866
The
lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort
neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native
orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,
transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,
acid and inoperative.	473.61725112477757
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
delegation that an heir had been born.	327.8500760075854
When he had betaken himself to
the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
tongues.	324.5683869177206
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	416.54450835849156
The moment was too propitious for the
display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union
among tempers so divergent.	343.2929391354187
Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
illustrations.	437.8067461941368
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
seat of castigation.	348.97827520634274
The
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,
envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some
stage antecedent to the human.	351.0385421869009
An outlandish delegate sustained against
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of
the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down
to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	334.4030615408095
The impression made by his
words was immediate but shortlived.	324.56147135338927
It was effaced as easily as it had
been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	377.468051121987
Contemporaneously,
a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	727.4438747854042
Hitherto silent, whether the
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
joined.	386.1854192584553
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	429.341961938767
He conjured up
the scene before them.	217.03556066812834
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back
and in the recess appeared...	330.8840796241866
Haines! Which of us did not feel his
flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,
in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were
depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	368.0258779270431
I
anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for
which, it seems, history is to blame.	347.12450574595283
Yes, it is true.	90.84866881151326
I am the
murderer of Samuel Childs.	262.4165195669824
And how I am punished! The inferno has no
terrors for me.	638.0492355372957
This is the appearance is on me.	91.22741410555994
Tare and ages, what
way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping
Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the
like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	290.49104917373734
My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this
life.	143.42435112360275
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	355.63557428990293
Distractions,
rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised
the phial to his lips), camping out.	363.02432803641744
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	930.8578326708829
Dope is my only hope...	139.75499439836625
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry
he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	461.76466041451897
An instant later his head
appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station
at ten past eleven.	339.2001475610274
He was gone.	88.74184617725707
Tears gushed from the eyes of the
dissipated host.	186.23797651938236
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The
vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	1003.3711499830754
The
sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense
debtorship for a thing done.	320.87449436157505
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	600.8143797720963
The mystery was unveiled.	326.813642518218
Haines was the third brother.	111.87796739592319
His real name
was Childs.	273.06369841316183
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	159.15086303750422
He drank drugs to obliterate.	439.0723918222306
For this relief much thanks.	323.37680026249393
The lonely
house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	310.42089145683155
No soul will live there.	209.6537232991516
The
spider pitches her web in the solitude.	421.2353947050073
The nocturnal rat peers from
his hole.	448.1642592637861
A curse is on it.	106.27346442639649
It is haunted.	231.8834496265408
Murderer’s ground.	102.20652392770849
What is the age of the soul of man?	73.03801809308064
As she hath the virtue of the
chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
her mood.	248.71908230520836
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
modest substance in the funds.	379.42117704015317
A score of years are blown away.	285.06429393533153
He is
young Leopold.	200.38018577139587
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	329.7476716417429
That young figure
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from
the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel
on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a
mother’s thought.	269.4863480735731
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in
his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a
fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,
a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright
trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out
upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but
the heart?	278.3406856223876
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.	299.0431419658226
The scent, the smile, but,
more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at
duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s
pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you
may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some
paper from the Europe of a month before.	322.5373421505322
But hey, presto, the mirror is
breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a
tiny speck within the mist.	442.448426118285
Now he is himself paternal and these about
him might be his sons.	178.47148068046917
Who can say?	111.45729722203416
The wise father knows his own
child.	268.7034319836138
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the
bonded stores there, the first.	245.62813056275957
Together (she is a poor waif, a child
of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her
luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two
raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	241.4166780238956
Bridie! Bridie Kelly!
He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,
the bridenight.	322.13843179314154
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the
world.	298.14049481402907
Did heart leap to heart?	221.6832565345882
Nay, fair reader.	447.0272208506017
In a breath ’twas
done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away
through the murk.	443.51354208046115
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	124.49261597066182
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	321.73421185509295
No, Leopold.	203.15938669399281
Name and
memory solace thee not.	295.60640563862574
That youthful illusion of thy strength was
taken from thee—and in vain.	334.27877907335386
No son of thy loins is by thee.	243.45737715343165
There is
none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	217.35936915790373
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over
regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	356.9536866858271
A region where grey
twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,
shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	858.2910283755552
She follows her
mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	439.3622125565075
Twilight
phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim
shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	780.6333395434791
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	413.64496685232416
Agendath is a waste land, a home
of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	234.79808844179442
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	110.07546980879786
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	247.50491894393915
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks
behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are
scorpions.	668.5062140105775
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and
mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	368.23575842702525
Ominous
revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned
and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the
giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all
their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	659.5038930370746
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	389.9432708526002
And the equine
portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s
own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	428.7494022927349
And lo,
wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger
of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	289.10948636630064
It is she, Martha, thou lost
one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	223.3471712145529
How serene does she
now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan
hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you
call it gossamer.	338.4202868264822
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and
loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply
swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a
myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled
sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	539.1531181536059
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
school together in Conmee’s time.	254.20782138189082
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
Pisistratus.	550.6946864690963
Where were they now?	94.01478645348558
Neither knew.	91.99529021958179
You have spoken of the
past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	193.96478124570643
Why think of them?	74.53530570650018
If I call them
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
my call?	280.7711040215182
Who supposes it?	242.82470360076857
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
bard, am lord and giver of their life.	452.25622826157786
He encircled his gadding hair
with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	457.6969274406425
That answer and those
leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your
genius father.	344.70837813183414
All who wish you well hope this for you.	164.4888407130162
All desire to
see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you
Stephaneforos.	270.3504736658728
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	349.4037735442559
O no, Vincent
Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	233.73890639852286
Have no fear.	138.1402012089999
He
could not leave his mother an orphan.	247.83579046564404
The young man’s face grew dark.	227.55128424890216
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and
of his recent loss.	159.75673755401957
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the
noise of voices allayed the smart.	226.98086728009739
Madden had lost five drachmas on
Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.	286.5296485145076
He told
them of the race.	91.59121820134634
The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran
out freshly with O.	490.90923476116126
Madden up.	45.161717238889764
She was leading the field.	137.54641360059844
All hearts
were beating.	368.27004549997395
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	405.44648549101834
She waved her
scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run
home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,
reached, outstripped her.	416.5332471775666
All was lost now.	112.01702780055058
Phyllis was silent: her
eyes were sad anemones.	272.68811971375396
But her lover
consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some
oval sugarplums which she partook.	331.9764454810898
A tear fell: one only.	266.4614035700932
A whacking
fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	674.6545226947802
Four winners yesterday and three
today.	351.8089827709508
What rider is like him?	180.82897151765525
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous
buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	230.40567650380967
But let us bear it
as was the ancient wont.	193.7425883766218
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said
with a light sigh.	213.82845168519415
She is not the filly that she was.	96.06593506366333
Never, by this
hand, shall we behold such another.	283.7929038170462
Do
you remember her, Vincent?	178.5950095506411
I wish you could have seen my queen today,
Vincent said.	296.0805632227187
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair
beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the
right name of it.	256.7644282033866
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air
drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	333.8452580153787
In
the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of
those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his
booth near the bridge.	337.1058289822898
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm
with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I
pressed too close.	281.37635044564655
She is more taking then.	145.13265667484956
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we
reclined together.	425.7070691932036
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who
met us as we left the field.	193.9513375529746
Conmee himself! He was walking by the
hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty
letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	333.9884527387096
The sweet creature
turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very
trees adore her.	371.90095167101373
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo
in that little mirror she carries.	296.8548713077548
But he had been kind.	106.48248439927248
In going by he
had blessed us.	140.75668801335175
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	319.9666352614316
If I had poor
luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
propensely.	395.4865648813899
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	241.6491897499317
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	732.0797073573625
His soul is far
away.	192.2796807945689
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born.	197.2987220822382
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods.	308.527670997598
Do you not think it, Stephen?	153.6970295880126
Theosophos
told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	495.1648258295356
The lords of the
moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of
the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation.	450.2593084258026
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
not the case at all.	231.49468194064713
The individual whose visual organs while the above
was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
speedily in the wrong shop.	443.8442869725773
During the past four minutes or thereabouts
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its
scarlet appearance.	347.293715324267
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	330.1487127551836
Eventually, however, both
their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other
was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the
neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid
sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out
with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it
about the place.	209.0727300828684
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life.	263.8075874191862
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	432.35019619438646
The
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
the loftiest and most vital.	243.04994684021148
The high hall of Horne’s house had never
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old
rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic.	339.0897780904357
A gallant scene in truth it made.	271.46421395945595
Crotthers was there at
the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	203.96253254809005
There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
depravity and premature wisdom.	452.0740452894423
Next the Scotchman was the place
assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in
stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	284.3396327568014
The chair of the resident
indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the
figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	524.5948340951049
Lastly at the head of the
board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of
Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated
the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained
by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and
constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever
efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired
pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	359.72362187644734
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S.	263.24701878089917
Dedalus’ (Div.	203.15938669399281
Scep.) contentions
would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter
to accepted scientific methods.	942.51815154165
Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.	523.6267622736324
The man of science like the
man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked
and explain them as best he can.	208.86810021481142
There may be, it is true, some
questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first
problem submitted by Mr L.	400.131095173526
Canv.) regarding the future
determination of sex.	354.78789475024047
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s
favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on
the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus
felix_, of the passive element.	301.2183884816741
The other problem raised by the same
inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	579.569531487917
It is interesting
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways.	237.6211581498948
Mr M.	203.15938669399281
Mulligan (Hyg.	203.15938669399281
et Eug.	203.15938669399281
Doc.) blames
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	1159.3179949878806
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles
offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers
of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	598.9634056802499
Kalipedia, he prophesied,
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as
Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	546.8923267126573
Mr
J.	203.15938669399281
Crotthers (Disc.	203.15938669399281
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy
labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by
far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in
the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or
in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	377.41030853898405
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,
all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
often baulk nature in her intentions.	275.78211265186013
An ingenious suggestion is that
thrown out by Mr V.	490.9394970749205
Lynch (Bacc.	203.15938669399281
Arith.) that both natality and
mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal
movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained.	412.05755168308013
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly
looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other
children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s
words, give us pause.	386.4767168737964
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
of the fittest.	385.83530186137193
Mr S.	203.15938669399281
Dedalus’ (Div.	203.15938669399281
Scep.) remark (or should it be
called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly
find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to.	651.5531853539343
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately
acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this
morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening
bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid
from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated
that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
dropped from its mother.	477.46576143349444
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	516.9633834381418
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as
is well known, Dr A.	378.8631161208964
Horne (Lic.	203.15938669399281
in Midw., F.	494.0867752080217
I.) is the
able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having
stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s
allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of
all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.	246.2314548480918
At the risk
of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the
less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was
delivered.	232.26129134426648
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
and doctor.	299.7138828132022
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
woman had manfully helped.	336.84047266078926
She had fought the good fight and
now she was very very happy.	192.9779281446968
Those who have passed on, who have gone
before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
scene.	241.88220775916392
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the
motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty
sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,
breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal
Husband.	248.14862566240708
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,
to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful
embraces.	295.2824353297804
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle
stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity
has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,
College Green branch.	311.9565300018662
God! How beautiful now
across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her
imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,
Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),
Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our
famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and
Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever
there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	479.41024412100705
Young hopeful will be
christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr
Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.	622.4583761634082
And so
time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	427.5658888878626
No, let no
sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	438.59226193261355
And Doady, knock the
ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the
curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light
whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so
with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	278.0317946282313
He knows and will call in His
own good time.	214.23864717792196
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally
your man’s part.	264.5538047388141
Sir, to you my hand.	70.86340249841238
Well done, thou good and faithful
servant!
	340.19571170965617
There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the
heart but they abide there and wait.	247.1161462179239
He may suffer their memory to grow
dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade
himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	256.354255870062
Yet a chance
word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront
him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while
timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with
wine.	282.2111349615859
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,
reproachful.	274.21328752592245
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.	343.3339982149663
A scene
disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a
word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	321.69864364468657
A shaven space
of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward
over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief
alert shock.	409.1367969461644
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at
times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,
Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of
arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of
them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin
so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	427.22890937291896
A lad of four or five in
linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth
when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the
urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	386.6183865952812
He frowns a little
just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment
of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother
watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint
shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad
look.	340.7612107358748
Mark this farther and remember.	166.78954685174403
The end comes suddenly.	320.36130604789986
Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
faces.	295.43719766570433
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	209.11052904679175
Quietude of
custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
ago.	300.52398632685623
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched
field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in
an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of
the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was
the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of
the word.	456.65719003654436
Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and
bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,
punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,
ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and
what not.	599.6114758508625
A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there.	586.6039661481425
Nurse
Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon
coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a
milligramme.	567.1836943892456
They hark him on.	155.62655942676736
The door! It is open?	259.6123123112598
Ha! They are out,
tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s
of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal.	406.553846678426
Dixon follows giving them
sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on.	316.220643234514

close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?	348.21648986630305
The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._
God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.	735.7044787705561
Breathe it deep into thee.	215.14338194155047
By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done
a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest
progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most
farraginous chronicle.	1033.2908503638475
Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven
preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of
man’s work.	553.3463061132621
Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog
and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang.	324.7157784332139
Thou art all their

Pshaw, I tell

Copulation without population! No, say I!
Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name.	445.84957875209125
Vegetables,
forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,
bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,

Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet,
varicose veins.	1764.522380209892

Drink, man, an udderful! Mother’s
milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning
stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those
rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the
honeymilk of Canaan’s land.	557.1502032007089

EDY BOARDMAN: _(Bickering.)_ And says the one: I seen you up Faithful
place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his
cometobed hat.	305.97424590262744
Did you, says I.	160.39609689018047
That’s not for you to say, says I.	118.64496385552272
You
never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I.	247.8463060208764
The

with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and
lancecorporal Oliphant.	302.5435744625913

	159.11967873411047
LYNCH: So that?	136.9004943862381
STEPHEN: (_Looks behind_.) So that gesture, not music not odour, would
be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the
lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.	441.8273019312327

STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?	319.186123850802
This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar.	328.3589983257107

A glow leaps in the south
beyond the seaward reaches of the river.	272.0822212561422
The navvy, staggering forward,
cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding.	461.3115937380369
On the farther
side under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming
bread and chocolate into a sidepocket.	476.05256926983583
From Gillen’s hairdresser’s

parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold
sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper.	360.7971658842887

upright.	767.9237342380937

feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.)_ Are you not

hand, and cries out in shrill alarm.)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have
they done to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and
ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat.	582.8017386905829

nicely! Scamp!

you are so inclined?	421.8668104177559
Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for
a fraction of a second?	142.09907032289365
MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily.)_ O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
	476.59765708157084
BLOOM: For old sake’ sake.	477.4324045009492

marriage mingling of our different little conjugials.	430.39201108732306

BLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand.)_ Josie Powell that was,
prettiest deb in Dublin.	360.7896484384036
How time flies by! Do you remember, harking
back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina
Simpson’s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,
finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading?	590.5146117425929
Subject, what is in this
snuffbox?	140.44882849732892
MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic
recitation and you looked the part.	221.11038515092687

the ladies.	132.34051053136992
BLOOM: _(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings,

Love’s old sweet song.	169.45137582503207
BLOOM: _(Meaningfully dropping his voice.)_ I confess I’m teapot with
curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little
teapot at present.	366.2071845559276
MRS BREEN: _(Gushingly.)_ Tremendously teapot! London’s teapot and I’m
simply teapot all over me! _(She rubs sides with him.)_ After the
parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the
staircase ottoman.	383.49199560141346
Under the mistletoe.	123.67492647444445

fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm

heart.	745.3552257065181

the beast.	201.99765836182218
I can never forgive you for that.	144.63809590057704
_(His clenched fist at his
brow.)_ Think what it means.	410.79728344043843
All you meant to me then.	110.45255230903132

glad eye.)_ Why didn’t you kiss the spot to make it well?	235.90200847279246
You wanted
to.	78.73545310733887
BLOOM: _(Shocked.)_ Molly’s best friend! Could you?	278.24206594060473
MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.)_
Hnhn.	540.056915424153
The answer is a lemon.	157.5210824240815
Have you a little present for me there?	104.43332642965107
BLOOM: _(Offhandedly.)_ Kosher.	217.6534670910984
A snack for supper.	393.6506903356658

Don’t attract attention.	344.6972835809909
I hate
stupid crowds.	684.6666453724358
I am not on pleasure bent.	214.320490413691
I am in a grave predicament.	200.48557094510576
MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and
bull story.	432.2150181299763
BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.	215.92346813022542
But you must never tell.	137.2694111476141
Not even Molly.	280.0698444017714
I have a most particular
reason.	198.30549961195808
MRS BREEN: _(All agog.)_ O, not for worlds.	467.5549419957779

	715.9724566956355
THE BAWD: Jewman’s melt!
	516.1948128673646
BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
tony buff shirt, shepherd’s plaid Saint Andrew’s cross scarftie, white
spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
bandolier and a grey billycock hat.)_ Do you remember a long long time,
years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?	515.6383550894408
BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown.	554.0588495958133
And Molly won seven shillings on a three
year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur
that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to
nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and
I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...	273.64507920696917
MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser!
	393.128322827434
BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other
ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I
admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though
it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a
thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.	261.7561995540106
MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!
	492.26627073510576
BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a
sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.	567.1897370536302
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much
for her style.	376.7299261373755
She was...	32.5875824183266
MRS BREEN: Too...	494.0867752080217
BLOOM: Yes.	203.15938669399281
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly
were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius
Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,
Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you
asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...	363.75189658703306
MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly.)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.	289.7930374240719
_(She fades from his side.	333.6142723240456
Followed by the whining dog he walks on
towards hellsgates.	276.044198526718
In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
feet apart, pisses cowily.	562.7883402920859
Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with
raucous humour.	484.07167510764214
An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in
maimed sodden playfight.)_
	779.5363809236078
THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when
Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he
after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there
waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers.	254.26148345434603
THE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates.)_ O jays!
	679.6982308291351
_(Their paintspeckled hats wag.	1392.1687379057769
Spattered with size and lime of their
lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_
	293.54953482639775
BLOOM: Coincidence too.	209.68482357821497
They think it funny.	174.81090833470373
Anything but that.	52.31501028196135

O jays, into the
men’s porter.	215.33958131581363

A pure mare’s nest.	406.4364016899918
I am
a man misunderstood.	186.0989291640255
I am being made a scapegoat of.	183.78706224852354

we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am
the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure.	335.99324289330326

I
don’t see it, that’s all.	89.24901551291771
No born gentleman, no-one with the most
rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
loathsome conduct.	372.39928816602844
One of those, my lord.	92.88758741105416
A plagiarist.	365.4416887200119
A soapy sneak
masquerading as a literateur.	841.5176740509605
It’s perfectly obvious that with the most
inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
suspicion.	426.9157373611196
The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout
the kingdom.	411.88359749173776

laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...	459.00027753099
BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You
funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don’t
think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.	628.4800776918828

Bad art.	120.60222456888837
BEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here
damning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my
maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.	385.1497933285612

rotter! _(To the court.)_ Why, look at the man’s private life! Leading
a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil.	407.0244097727954

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one.	244.85080860644436
I bear a respectable
character and was four months in my last place.	237.96222424124903
I was in a situation,
six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
owing to his carryings on.	235.68072602107202
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	278.4522838459864
MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of
myself as poor as I am.	385.89692580101223
BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white.	803.2289766336625
I
gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.	665.7148902792376
Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.	329.8777350288502
There’s a medium in all things.	110.29233402233734
Play cricket.	266.01283497161296
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night

FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of?	644.1171900325808
Did something happen?	263.25784098013617
MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your
honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for
a safety pin.	294.54548807665395
He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a
result.	252.6732191354636
And he interfered twict with my clothing.	365.08651266474254
BLOOM: She counterassaulted.	857.7157624187907
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the
scouringbrush, so I had.	340.2873702503916
I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he
remarked: keep it quiet.	292.1007381449857

_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
a long unintelligible speech.	634.3255986865736
They would hear what counsel had to say
in his stirring address to the grand jury.	225.50625776545567
He was down and out but,
though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to
reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and
return to nature as a purely domestic animal.	230.31414877546356
A sevenmonths’ child, he
had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.	511.54507577464767
An
acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one
and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
ever...._

whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of
stickingplaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)_
	428.4959651704012
O’MOLLOY: _(In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
a voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor.	471.8055415320257
We are not in a
beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice.	270.75504666482715
My
client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a
stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny.	393.2526033692629
The trumped up
misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the
Pharaoh.	438.0044496628307
_Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at
carnally knowing.	303.1581045226296
Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of
by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated.	259.5975572999688
I would
deal in especial with atavism.	395.7009897004494
There have been cases of shipwreck and
somnambulism in my client’s family.	272.2333015385303
If the accused could speak he could
a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between
the covers of a book.	218.52410934878998
He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
cobbler’s weak chest.	364.88003537572473
His submission is that he is of Mongolian
extraction and irresponsible for his actions.	292.9340305403624
Not all there, in fact.	91.77214266517245
BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers,
apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about
him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead.	417.89294167167014
Then he hitches
his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes
the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine

_(He is howled down.)_
	261.26911731607146
O’MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace.)_ This is a lonehand fight.	300.5383752768095
By
Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this
fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas.	376.6313790454818
The Mosaic code has
superseded the law of the jungle.	332.6194581059681
I say it and I say it emphatically,
without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused
was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered
with.	317.3141615106007
The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very
own daughter.	273.32314562597793
_(Bloom takes J.	617.6389216875574
O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his
lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that
the hidden hand is again at its old game.	246.62535800042872
When in doubt persecute
Bloom.	474.95330832273964
My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the
world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object
to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some
dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will
on her.	314.7233596776244
He wants to go straight.	192.48767396046858
I regard him as the whitest man I
know.	283.2746434576451
He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his
extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of
which will now be shown.	369.24819384344056
_(To Bloom.)_ I suggest that you will do the
handsome thing.	311.0296762673215
BLOOM: A penny in the pound.	195.15458726737884

His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with
sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F.	555.7204980356693
He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the
galloping tide of rosepink blood.)_
	290.6571671340339
O’MOLLOY: _(Almost voicelessly.)_ Excuse me.	453.09140484526455
I am suffering from
a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed.	384.9073491007116
A few wellchosen
words.	424.643187166322
_(He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal
eloquence of Seymour Bushe.)_ When the angel’s book comes to be opened
if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and
of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the
bar the sacred benefit of the doubt.	399.8951548061398
BLOOM: _(In court dress.)_ Can give best references.	465.815491689321

ex lord mayor of Dublin.	400.6952009086287
I have moved in the charmed circle of the
highest...	168.2319336243771
_(Carelessly.)_ I was just
chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir
Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee.	443.0750948824076
Sir Bob, I
said...	339.27239792854846
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.)_ Arrest him, constable.	697.2090906492929
He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless
globes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command
performance of _La Cigale_.	278.74973362583717
I deeply inflamed him, he said.	224.8624569646907
He made
improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m.	378.7108517849904
on
the following Thursday, Dunsink time.	296.6946778872584
He offered to send me through the
post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl
with the Three Pairs of Stays_.	439.52787426826967
MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,
steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_
Also to me.	468.91878138548554
Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person.	261.8771534141652
Because
he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	404.48216496910493
Subsequently
he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in
my honour.	193.72221967252
I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant
purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.	301.55788291672076
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!
	367.11085659263415
_(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)_
	434.3434207174269
THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming.)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,
Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
	950.9203170057481
SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.	468.81476714078576
MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed
himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his
fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing
my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon
garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or.	468.8985053024312
He lauded almost
extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose
drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden
treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up.	572.533040874168
He
urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to
defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible
opportunity.	315.2474921046856
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me.	984.3143969556593
Because he saw me on the polo
ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
Ireland.	272.08464833247035
My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady.	636.9092550941822
I have it still.	87.92215214379654
It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard.	543.848767468183
He urged me
to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison.	251.73954353009225
He
implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
vicious horsewhipping.	335.39686819909036
MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.	405.1438255700793
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.	601.4985160632358

sudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me.	465.17992967719226
I’ll scourge
the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him.	396.73010336691493
I’ll flay him
alive.	377.1306504285576
BLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly.)_ Here?	613.6221576069787
_(He squirms.)_
Again! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.	678.5758281837345
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I’ll make it hot for
you.	508.3371004779078
I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.	279.7130693513423
MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and
stripes on it!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,
my fine fellow?	588.0104513153561
Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of
your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever
bargained for.	236.72664026439804
You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into
fury.	419.0079033115928
MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_
Make him smart, Hanna dear.	601.2116134510098

cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty.	770.2937753621788
Forget, forgive.	209.2057154724349
_(He offers the other cheek.)_
	246.30889270306773
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don’t do so on any account, Mrs
Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
	616.4441362011123
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
violently.)_ I’ll do no such thing.	596.2627063007835
Pigdog and always was ever since he
was pupped! To dare address me! I’ll flog him black and blue in the
public streets.	326.4340954328688
I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel.	212.85342707052146
He is a
wellknown cuckold.	207.1590817306195
_(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air.)_
Take down his trousers without loss of time.	358.7955215634392

He is a rather quaint

He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the
court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which
clears up everything.	378.02006926691433
He is practically a total abstainer and I can
affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,
cold dried grocer’s peas.	488.6125272354261
He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish

The rite is the poet’s rest.	183.45930374640704
It may be an
old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini._
It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round
David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s

	494.0867752080217
STEPHEN: Here’s another for you.	141.5272492212963

should opine.	382.47642295925607
Backbone in front, so to say.	99.41229444161229

Am I right?	241.14889051353384

She seems sad.	330.55003319700575

number three.	484.5417345937324
There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye.	168.0736427029077
Observe
the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull.	285.3741174851788
What ho, she
bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.	503.8334819457633
BLOOM: _(Regretfully.)_ When you come out without your gun.	266.81513309975065

VIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling.)_ Lyum! Look.	586.6109830262121
Her beam is broad.	333.3545827301843
She is
coated with quite a considerable layer of fat.	297.417747918276
Obviously mammal in
weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
which leave nothing to be desired save compactness.	436.27791187652724
Such fleshy parts
are the product of careful nurture.	495.8729420572731

only a wart.	477.33920939986524

taught you on that head?	279.947163363637

It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of
accidents.	420.15134305532814
I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...	571.0956653148111
VIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.)_ Stop
twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk.	369.9285504262624

Exercise your mnemotechnic.	243.02134091084628

parasitic tissues.	487.2496441754464
Then nay no I have an inkling.	431.2031373194572

like or dislike women in male habiliments?	225.97694080398853
_(With a dry snigger.)_ You
intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem
and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that
million.	308.9835879909501
Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.	192.14431517179744

crows derisively.)_ Keekeereekee!

_(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled
mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)_
	528.7167509270829
BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded.	279.72111584434407

But tomorrow is a new day will be.	153.65154907576354

brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the
inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve
in dorsal region.	480.2474426811473

nasally.)_ They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year

We were very pleased, we others.	267.2783285542729
_(He
coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a
scooping hand.)_ You shall find that these night insects follow the

Seems new.	80.73480911502766
Must come.	66.72309449775688

_(The door opens.	521.0224718780947
Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters.	785.6014856619925
She is
dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
Minnie Hauck in_ Carmen.	733.969975532422
_On her left hand are wedding and keeper
rings.	303.79865246103543
Her eyes are deeply carboned.	400.16466714182485
She has a sprouting moustache.	263.04691063655594
Her
olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted

She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)_

_(She glances round her at the couples.	268.7897026644288
Then her eyes rest on Bloom
with hard insistence.	302.2154981302788
Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated
faceneck and embonpoint.	724.3599362463672
Her falcon eyes glitter.)_
	472.41966324873067
THE FAN: _(Flirting quickly, then slowly.)_ Married, I see.	443.69072993179617
BLOOM: Yes.	203.15938669399281
Partly, I have mislaid...	464.131993506278

THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.)_ Have you
forgotten me?	471.28214600734293
BLOOM: Nes.	203.15938669399281
THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist.)_ Is me her was you dreamed
before?	373.6153641590098
Was then she him you us since knew?	158.63246049322845
Am all them and the same

In my eyes read that slumber which
women love.	246.4350866437932
THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ We have met.	344.34409316937297
It is fate.	158.50725443205246
BLOOM: _(Cowed.)_ Exuberant female.	286.3024383917849
Enormously I desiderate your
domination.	930.3304738731945
I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young.	386.46076165376525
I stand, so to
speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
the too late box of the general postoffice of human life.	321.4344513228162
The door and
window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
second according to the law of falling bodies.	287.1968678000074
I have felt this instant
a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle.	386.31862137932995
It runs in our family.	213.02764512476563
Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it.	256.21529570832115
A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat.	492.64325247147156
Near the
end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
Athos, faithful after death.	323.06934815361126

BLOOM: _(Undecided.)_ All now?	218.8077061983109
I should not have parted with my
talisman.	274.93364824139724
Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my
time of life.	249.0654972824135
Every phenomenon has a natural cause.	266.44748464744055
THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly.)_ You may.	530.8812306408594

In
courtesy.	365.4416887200119
I knelt once before today.	346.69379558941876
_(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.	424.7659678598135
Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
draws out and in her laces.)_
	322.3375884779387
BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly.)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my
love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up
crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies.	523.3111432544159
Even their wax model
Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
toe, as worn in Paris.	708.4531864398385
THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide.	691.3579488576263
Feel my royal weight.	243.78762540207842
BLOOM: _(Crosslacing.)_ Too tight?	298.4556036406029
THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.	698.6314633341157
BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
dance.	255.8672537806305
Bad luck.	142.94614372002445
Hook in wrong tache of her...	147.1220365899963

Bella places her foot on the floor.	142.75919766382881
Bloom raises
his head.	162.50023482420028
Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow.	269.7369826963465
His eyes grow
dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_

gentlemen,...	489.2762100746491

BELLO: Down! _(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.)_ Incline feet
forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall.	413.9044172696192
You are falling.	162.6030418301913
On the hands down!
	71.58610455987798
BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)_
Truffles!
	348.79317793058266
BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his
shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat,
sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck
deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it
in.)_ Footstool! Feel my entire weight.	564.3381987735532
Bow, bondslave, before the
throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud
erectness.	441.4069567770354
BLOOM: _(Enthralled, bleats.)_ I promise never to disobey.	512.2114760095329
BELLO: _(Laughs loudly.)_ Holy smoke! You little know what’s in store
for you.	285.893999575374
I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!
I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.	322.47573678576344
Cheek me, I dare you.	257.5782005351757
If you do tremble in anticipation of heel
discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.	380.26770769542475
_(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_
	269.59936651629846
ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her.)_ She’s not here.	213.15476279551652
BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes.)_ She’s not here.	173.48455460452087
She’ll be good, sir.	146.75194661567815
KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello.	313.54817852456614
Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.	344.18670591966463
BELLO: _(Coaxingly.)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you,
darling, just to administer correction.	409.4062747285999
Just a little heart to heart
talk, sweety.	227.4943375138888
_(Bloom puts out her timid head.)_ There’s a good girly
now.	347.09171291595703
_(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.)_ I only
want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot.	359.65946354553773
How’s that
tender behind?	141.53148084223082
O, ever so gently, pet.	337.4441079273339
Begin to get ready.	122.01674454229797
BLOOM: _(Fainting.)_ Don’t tear my...	261.53538896793145
BELLO: _(Savagely.)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the
hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like
the Nubian slave of old.	384.02632368202444
You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you
remember me for the balance of your natural life.	183.74225501543108
_(His forehead veins
swollen, his face congested.)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback
every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat
hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter.	501.5283856838559
_(He belches.)_ And suck
my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed
Victualler’s Gazette_.	841.7454182721128
Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and
skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling
from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and
lemon or currant sauce.	455.07447348132405
It will hurt you.	154.444176167887
_(He twists her arm.	469.34119245680057
Bloom
squeals, turning turtle.)_
	517.8816789194558
BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse! Don’t!
	462.9028832845986
BELLO: _(Twisting.)_ Another!
	217.6534670910984
BLOOM: _(Screams.)_ O, it’s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches
like mad!
	395.0016744563527
BELLO: _(Shouts.)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That’s the
best bit of news I heard these six weeks.	394.3747789158418
Here, don’t keep me waiting,
damn you! _(He slaps her face.)_
	270.080649114006
BLOOM: _(Whimpers.)_ You’re after hitting me.	328.67752329411604
I’ll tell...	126.97558544095983
BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.	373.1108298071328
ZOE: Yes.	203.15938669399281
Walk on him! I will.	149.54349415351075
FLORRY: I will.	220.256347655232
Don’t be greedy.	212.5089509708763
KITTY: No, me.	175.81097875270214
Lend him to me.	51.281846612571144
_(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
men’s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin
stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the
door.)_
	487.76520720034625
MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously.)_ Can I help?	516.0872751539106
_(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_
	392.9848576386914
BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom’s upturned face, puffing
cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference
shares are at sixteen three quarters.	483.00887175239734
Curse me for a fool that didn’t
buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about.	226.1059080000999
Just my infernal luck,
curse it.	343.87797738010454
And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.	311.85178668744237
_(He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom’s ear.)_ Where’s that
Goddamned cursed ashtray?	602.6027823300319
BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered.)_ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
	702.2017086011928
BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes.	272.5451131133039
Pray for it as you never
prayed before.	137.91844360654207
_(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.)_ Here,
kiss that.	493.97567511406055
_(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice.)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to
Banbury cross.	480.43891077942203
I’ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes.	310.97057201132054
_(He bends
sideways and squeezes his mount’s testicles roughly, shouting.)_ Ho!
Off we pop! I’ll nurse you in proper fashion.	659.834850472201
_(He horserides
cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.)_ The lady goes a pace a pace
and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a
gallop a gallop a gallop.	287.11903820730157
FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello.)_ Let me on him now.	207.5333423078308
You had enough.	117.27493571002904
I asked
before you.	111.86224540786789
ZOE: _(Pulling at Florry.)_ Me.	284.659727506544
BLOOM: _(Stifling.)_ Can’t.	208.49400585207508
BELLO: Well, I’m not.	342.9043980590058
_(He holds in his breath.)_ Curse it.	222.1603992673112
This bung’s about burst.	338.2756086681272
_(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
his features, farts loudly.)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself.)_ Yes,
by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.	711.3434539464272
BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him.)_ Not man.	312.6761958169186
_(He sniffs.)_
Woman.	559.376273898302
BELLO: _(Stands up.)_ No more blow hot and cold.	284.04909396893
What you longed for
has come to pass.	193.21419789198043
Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a
thing under the yoke.	207.71426644942272
Now for your punishment frock.	312.25605441257164
You will shed your
male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen?	586.6863278343651
and don the shot silk
luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders.	350.048871278188
And quickly too!
	144.7363543640419
BLOOM: _(Shrinks.)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I
tiptouch it with my nails?	757.4625022243788
BELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be,
wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven
armpits.	432.33159013360466
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin.	397.0052105626819
You will be
laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with
whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,
while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in
nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things
stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for
Alice and nice scent for Alice.	598.5320326298684
Alice will feel the pullpull.	193.76933501192187
Martha
and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing
but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind
you...	363.5444035593021
BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
male hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,
a small prank, in Holles street.	472.21969715296416
When we were hard up I washed them to
save the laundry bill.	338.3031352305634
My own shirts I turned.	521.8766820834504
It was the purest
thrift.	227.25003719013756
BELLO: _(Jeers.)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh?	428.43656659765605
And showed
off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
your unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of
surrender, eh?	569.45370590191
Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop
shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her
last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel,
eh?	590.2870797013561
BLOOM: Miriam.	203.15938669399281
BELLO: _(Guffaws.)_ Christ Almighty it’s too tickling, this! You were a
nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay
swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.	512.3726445137243
P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus,
the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid
Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton.	1042.242778394865
_(He guffaws
again.)_ Christ, wouldn’t it make a Siamese cat laugh?	450.22863460830877
BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working.)_ It was Gerald converted me
to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High
School play _Vice Versa_.	457.7606540482059
It was dear Gerald.	216.59482859466445
He got that kink,
fascinated by sister’s stays.	388.5354769719882
Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint
and gilds his eyelids.	1015.5229726211462
BELLO: _(With wicked glee.)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you
took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on
the smoothworn throne.	654.8227939944649
BLOOM: Science.	203.15938669399281
To compare the various joys we each enjoy.	457.7371100344858
_(Earnestly.)_ And really it’s better the position...	232.23079042799873
BELLO: _(Sternly.)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the
corner for you.	272.90781309234677
I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I?	486.0446210641528
Do it
standing, sir! I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a
trace on your swaddles.	459.17413557560997
Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a
martinet.	272.91177638854685
The sins of your past are rising against you.	220.57682576049345
THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
Black church.	311.93787562076875
Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently
to the instrument in the callbox.	431.31963921871983
By word and deed he frankly
encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an
unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	529.1358787975494
In five public
conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner
to all strongmembered males.	792.0824803523435
And by the offensively smelling vitriol
works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to
see if and what and how much he could see?	267.44934394648055
Did he not lie in bed, the
gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper

Well
for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and
warts all over it.	201.48331856662307
He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee

sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,

I felt it was expected of me.	129.79161074797668
Force of
habit.	92.56940907841103
THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
act, the hit of the century.	917.1792388088356
I was hidden in cheap pink paper that
smelt of rock oil.	340.69663877085895
I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,
stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice
and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with
testimonial from ruptured gentleman.	691.1405718772281
Useful hints to the married.	156.3759209438432

BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_
	508.2721731162946
THE NYMPH: I do.	403.5022371261855
You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
above your marriage couch.	455.67119966703774
Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
four places.	278.77509541220655
And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my
shame.	304.5640394312426
BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful

Sleep reveals the
worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted.	454.91137906606656

bed or rather was pushed.	268.8598767257215
Steel wine is said to cure snoring.	263.638011551012
For the
rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some
days ago, incorrectly addressed.	452.5786746032612
It claims to afford a noiseless,
inoffensive vent.	745.2364275617543
Frailty, thy name is
marriage.	255.0921766262724
THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears.)_ And words.	312.2094249608765
They are not in my

BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously.)_ That antiquated commode.	915.9618395341648
It wasn’t
her weight.	220.57741384969526
She scaled just eleven stone nine.	683.3728701171941
She put on nine pounds
after weaning.	351.23405748626186
It was a crack and want of glue.	141.20993529731558
And that absurd
orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.	484.3756821817009

Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?	449.2276398417284
BLOOM: _(Scared.)_ High School of Poula?	324.4779220904484
Not in full possession

Run over by tram.	150.6044062671953
THE ECHO: Sham!

BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
badge.)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy.	545.5113653550857
A little then sufficed, a
jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory,
the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice),
even a pricelist of their hosiery.	426.9328586851151
And then the heat.	92.06701925396919
There were
sunspots that summer.	271.3646017070462
End of school.	79.39241406277641

Halcyon days.	99.21513207755018
_(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a
clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_
	761.4838954240657
THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again.	733.7327096576863
Hurray! _(They cheer.)_
	235.59761935607662
BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
snowballs, struggles to rise.)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark!

Hurray for the High School!

THE YEWS: _(Rustling.)_ She is right, our sister.	329.21215398011554
_(Whispered
kisses are heard in all the wood.	226.93043562659855

profaned our silent shade?	384.43813205653277
THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers.)_ There?	493.4353993587173
In the open air?	95.13147121901545

The fauna.	365.4416887200119
I sacrificed to the god of
the forest.	125.6465610897202
The flowers that bloom in the spring.	107.9395440263716
It was pairing time.	196.73626045633677
Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon.	246.4738301190337
Lotty Clarke,
flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
with poor papa’s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly.	973.3510329831064

my epitaph be written.	326.9530661587015
I have...	47.94351137115624
BLOOM: Done.	203.15938669399281
THE NYMPH: _(Loftily.)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a
place and no hair there either.	284.2331261100221
We are stonecold and pure.	243.5570721265042

BLOOM: _(Dejected.)_ Yes.	217.6534670910984
_Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
altar where the back changes name.	320.9360770705162

panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
beechmast and acorns.)_ Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
	901.8080476815098
BLOOM: It overpowers me.	536.7613876470361
The warm impress of her warm form.	299.49793295606037
Even to sit
where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
white sateen coatpans.	468.59627074542686
So womanly, full.	342.1662420307973
It fills me full.	315.6511322411898

O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers

To keep it up,

To keep it up.	98.20348175971702
BLOOM: _(Coldly.)_ You have broken the spell.	289.5065874696328
The last straw.	212.09800423594427
If there
were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices?	280.4282159072322
Shy
but willing like an ass pissing.	439.7033614556039
THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
aging and swaying.)_ Deciduously!
	641.8163893444771
THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her
habit.)_ Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! _(A large moist stain appears
on her robe.)_ Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment
of a pure woman.	480.07374569737283
_(She clutches again in her robe.)_ Wait.	370.85528560141216
Satan,
you’ll sing no more lovesongs.	246.2652066571891
_(She draws a
poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine,
strikes at his loins.)_ Nekum!

No pruningknife.	464.672675952932
The fox and the grapes, is
it?	126.01942248274723
What do you lack with your barbed wire?	325.0809810016174
Crucifix not thick enough?	222.37851265694957
_(He clutches her veil.)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame
gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother
Alphonsus, eh Reynard?	486.9324990940543
THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.)_ Poli...!
	461.14203236562463
BLOOM: _(Calls after her.)_ As if you didn’t get it on the double
yourselves.	208.69453149089574
I tried it.	116.49283469122113
Your strength our weakness.	424.6268515680258

I have sixteen years of black slave labour

	354.0132781540888
BELLA: You’ll know me the next time.	186.93114467833843
Long
in the tooth and superfluous hair.	169.95686426109287
A raw onion the last thing at night
would benefit your complexion.	379.53201173499843
And take some double chin drill.	552.7491597402826
Your
eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox.	286.97165052751996
They have the
dimensions of your other features, that’s all.	130.06656814613822

Mind your cornflowers.	297.390237242437

Who’s making love to my sweeties?	203.76950514678086

ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.	215.48740113102664
BLOOM: _(With feeling.)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor
mamma.	301.81920452220146
Give a thing and take it back
	88.21379209446604
God’ll ask you where is that
	128.42700135701668
You’ll say you don’t know
	146.26600738134564
God’ll send you down below.	250.27100697497872
BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it.	182.32898782660186
I should like to have it.	93.00071021126888
STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.	120.66818802775049
ZOE: Here.	203.15938669399281
_(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.)_ Those that hides
knows where to find.	316.54957909557515
BELLA: _(Frowns.)_ Here.	217.6534670910984
This isn’t a musical peepshow.	346.99773489875275

Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking
out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_
	166.70542507541896
STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness.)_ This silken purse I made out
of the sow’s ear of the public.	366.99203206703476
Madam, excuse me.	146.07364304325833
If you allow me.	136.18624230895932

Kitty.)_ Do you want three girls?	293.8931581594432
STEPHEN: _(Delightedly.)_ A hundred thousand apologies.	504.98467564643346

again and takes out and hands her two crowns.)_ Permit, _brevi manu_,
my sight is somewhat troubled.	516.5824146091537

himself in monosyllables.	285.13523380438784

Kitty leans over
Zoe’s neck.	386.4358382202285

you’re a liar, excuse me...	224.90983253598694
the gentleman paid

it’s long after eleven.	148.81849039197078
STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.)_ No

A riddle!
	216.97884341188544

LYNCH: Hoopla!
	203.15938669399281
_(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)_

Florry.)_ So.	308.4329990599982

BELLA: _(Admiringly.)_ You’re such a slyboots, old cocky.	392.55534001844813
I could kiss

STEPHEN: Lucifer.	203.15938669399281
BLOOM: _(Quietly.)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take
care of.	197.7350113462088
Why pay more?	165.86638351493278
STEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins.)_ Be just before you are generous.	242.04412752272916
BLOOM: I will but is it wise?	213.6969805043329

about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers.	315.5453313383003

railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn
envelopes drenched in aniseed.	488.5826323131672

You die for your country.	188.76481172211595
_(He places his arm on
Private Carr’s sleeve.)_ Not that I wish it for you.	341.4174708477676
But I say: Let my
country die for me.	337.37809797924365
Up to the present it has done so.	112.04251715637878
I didn’t want it

I understand, sir.	187.2317215276643
SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.	259.50608980146995
FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to
report it at the station.	304.61411479013367
BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly.)_ Naturally.	314.60335971448944
Quite right.	69.27235476835287
Only your bounden

CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.	455.0785535937744
THE WATCH: _(Saluting together.)_ Night, gentlemen.	455.33491304864225
_(They move off
with slow heavy tread.)_
	403.3018300007187
BLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene.	168.97225905423775
You have a
car?...	92.68084323342033
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
the car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were
standing fizz in Jammet’s.	330.0061523088579
Like princes, faith.	404.46681368416387
One of them lost two
quid on the race.	142.57637755987201
Drowning his grief.	120.20822138319683
And were on for a go with the
jolly girls.	117.93916480193461
So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.	275.879331247041
BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...	339.19091108353274
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the
mots.	245.31934293438474
No, by God, says I.	307.47520869031644
Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.	225.29219701342154
_(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we
have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me?	260.73899770468097
Hah, hah, hah!
	785.8418305900025
BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he! Yes.	205.96851858902625
Matter of fact I was just
visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor
fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together
and I was just making my way home...	233.14022525625404
_(The horse neighs.)_
	423.6809649238204
THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
	770.5244035147354
CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after
we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up
and got off to see.	253.09423777693303
_(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.	680.564444261842
Will I give him a lift home?	254.311068880248
Where does he hang out?	165.7730137817203
Somewhere in
Cabra, what?	122.23388773785301
BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.	328.92456581570764
_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars.	376.0203519238092
Corny Kelleher, asquint,
drawls at the horse.	491.9304054616756
Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_
	219.2938846052411
CORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape.)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and
calls to Stephen.)_ Eh! _(He calls again.)_ Eh! He’s covered with
shavings anyhow.	442.0581124995503
Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.	267.33380696435825
BLOOM: No, no, no.	181.7228082775891
I have his money and his hat here and stick.	117.55046616464858
CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it.	240.6568089384275
No bones broken.	349.118270626926
Well,
I’ll shove along.	478.94638555481464
_(He laughs.)_ I’ve a rendezvous in the morning.	300.64770604132144
Burying the dead.	50.32455395564331
Safe home!
	89.43071292324764
THE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.	335.55262591755354
BLOOM: Good night.	242.56793497113148
I’ll just wait and take him along in a few...	142.0029710957578
_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	314.59407386409976
The horse
harness jingles.)_
	435.36450570618524
CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.	306.7879858924325
BLOOM: Night.	203.15938669399281
_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	607.3494044736342
The
car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	282.48293225059496
Corny Kelleher on the
sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight.	274.4782459809976
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the
farther seat.	499.19537299098744
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	416.18672642282485
With thumb
and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	326.1735074842886
With a slow nod Bloom
conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	506.1058125854643
The car
jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	274.13835365791147
Corny
Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	270.98636432775436
Bloom with his hand
assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.	287.20872631543006
The tinkling
hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo
lay.	898.7434775238969
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings,
and ashplant, stands irresolute.	368.51565731179096
Then he bends to him and shakes him by
the shoulder.)_
	113.92950382738506
BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!
_(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call.	353.62525089145885
_(He bends
again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
form.)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer.	297.94439639242535
He calls again.)_ Stephen!
	250.8045486499393
STEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who?	217.6534670910984
Black panther.	236.72887101340675
_(He sighs and
stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)_

_(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_
	397.19970836629466
BLOOM: Poetry.	203.15938669399281
Well educated.	317.5334699131929
_(He bends again and undoes the
buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat.)_ To breathe.	397.4077845176769
_(He brushes the
woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers.)_ One
pound seven.	406.7247773864281
Not hurt anyhow.	314.5523220921388

_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.	352.1636265044252
Bloom,
holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect.	257.89586299641513
A dog barks in the
distance.	208.2048144984196
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.	294.859939591774
He looks
down on Stephen’s face and form.)_
	173.82919702301825
BLOOM: _(Communes with the night.)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.	174.48797492185832
In the shady wood.	234.8409224385546
The deep white breast.	321.7923975288377

Best thing could happen him.	210.4631402084134
_(He murmurs.)_...	285.69253917249654

that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,
art or arts...	563.996048750577
_(He murmurs.)_...	285.69253917249654
in the rough sands of the sea...	125.93090046904379
a

where the tide ebbs...	225.9377160741892
and flows
...	242.1665734207769
_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips
in the attitude of secret master.	297.70862432093685
Against the dark wall a figure
appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed
in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a
book in his hand.	307.59199215726676
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling,
kissing the page.)_
	301.36014319854127
BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy!
	438.904955856609
RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading,
kissing, smiling.	387.3797371306114
He has a delicate mauve face.	252.43150044142527
On his suit he has
diamond and ruby buttons.	258.1640175990719
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat
pocket.)_
	280.8126879746476
Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	399.44018362918274
His
(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a
bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry
water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit
upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the
cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt
bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk
and soda or a mineral.	329.1175595973163
But how to get there was the rub.	112.82873770897861
For the nonce
he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon
him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and
means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	471.55376983009495
So far as he could see he
was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly
advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in
their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,
always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.	242.62481023420665
Accordingly
after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having
forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had
done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together
along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and
the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.	321.30977611057233
But
as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by
emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,
twice.	355.9595052389944
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
which they accordingly did.	197.9679762399086
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the
Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
light of the mischance.	323.699191979011
So as neither of them were particularly pressed
for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they
dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a
fare or a jarvey.	339.28372455110036
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s
sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his
companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of
some little while back.	399.65093340503364
They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of
course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the
backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the
Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its
C division police station.	389.8915256935339
Between this point and the high at present
unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot
place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as
his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of
James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,
the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities
of the public the primary and most indispensable.	333.31832819705227
Bread, the staff of
life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the
baker’s it is said.	255.88043433297472
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in
complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact
disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of
nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely
permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of
the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age
particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence
of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as
even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if
you didn’t look out.	329.4752085751478
Highly providential was the appearance on the
scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for
that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might
have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,
failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day
before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant
to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got
bruited about.	293.3848631966876
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those
policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in
the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or
two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole
through a ten gallon pot.	314.1859739593849
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet
parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law
were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to
protect the upper classes.	246.6976127992818
Another thing he commented on was equipping
soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off
at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians
should by any chance they fall out over anything.	390.84399323334225
into the bargain and the
greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the
much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing
aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch
believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably
drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of
your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	303.67294663803875
Most of all he
commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
_confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his
brother medicos under all the circs.	270.82372494656073
—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
whatsoever of any kind.	203.5293081645987
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a
brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one
attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	326.7274168215078
Stephen of his own accord
stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren
cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just
make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom
of the sentrybox.	232.71908489322576
He began to remember that this had happened or had
been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small
effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
_quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.	260.15504053176494
To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	212.48693288265514
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	362.4126624473197
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
saluted again, calling:
	377.08365123906964
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
compliment.	278.3906886130881
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
though not funkyish in the least.	426.70315016453685
Though unusual in the Dublin area he
knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames
embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	389.57573321430107
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s
breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	339.1275747251288
Lord John Corley some called him
and his genealogy came about in this wise.	288.40444237628236
He was the eldest son of
inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a
certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.	344.16508078290286
His
grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of
a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	527.1261674405825
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had
enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	294.48561695207667
This
therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though
dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	443.4286216359739
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	285.65166960410113
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.	188.65139829314717
His friends
had all deserted him.	230.51093523032415
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of
other uncalledfor expressions.	225.94468321324936
He was out of a job and implored of
Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something,
anything at all, to do.	163.66306517463622
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the
washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they
were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete
fabrication from start to finish.	201.5248905262715
Anyhow he was all in.	45.29484006052978
Mr Garrett Deasy.	494.0867752080217
Try it.	30.60773084408939
You
may mention my name.	247.4866832564248
—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man.	486.54318585266395
I was
never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	178.471628697147
I got stuck
twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	226.01971852087976
—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	309.8327350283586
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
tart off the street.	207.7053033251651
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	307.12985564309145
He was starving too though he
hadn’t said a word about it.	172.83787980028947
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he
knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was
hardly deserving of much credence.	253.66895794636258
However _haud ignarus malorum
miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially
as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the
month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of
fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	334.1902592682957
But the cream
of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was
living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	159.7512199375175
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of
finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a
bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get
sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his
chagrin, he found his cash missing.	212.4798916047748
A few broken biscuits were all the
result of his investigation.	262.486593159186
He tried his hardest to recollect for the
moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in
that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse
in fact.	226.10114755181257
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough
search though he tried to recollect.	379.8615559812803
About biscuits he dimly
remembered.	503.4172147339962
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did
he buy.	210.7110486202366
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in
the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	228.86432155254366
—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	560.8015436611005
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	117.17231245232793
Stephen anyhow lent him
one of them.	153.81918432063352
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.	212.6638811926751
I’ll pay you back one
time.	170.48299943926676
Who’s that with you?	48.56169829528801
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	241.5739433468786
You might put in a good
word for us to get me taken on there.	141.16584762048
I’d carry a sandwichboard only
the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three
weeks, man.	212.7887226350863
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the
Carl Rosa.	218.9145794687498
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as
a crossing sweeper.	324.0843322763984
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,
bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with
O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.	204.38144388694045
Anyhow he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	206.9610715102519
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while Dublin slept.	313.1526397792262
He threw an odd eye at the same
time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired
interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though
where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the
remotest idea when.	268.6391199715101
Being a levelheaded individual who could give
points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on
his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally
testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	421.84528780085765
Palpably he was one of his
hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one
preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put
it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street
chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the
option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	190.28758788984052
In any case he
had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that
hour of the night or morning.	256.5245115206729
Pretty thick that was certainly.	166.6282684504358
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite.	346.5109931603148
Alluding to the encounter he
said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
	176.14983345671388
—He is down on his luck.	107.36883193087414
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	237.91326709702773
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:
	402.74948874431595
—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	284.4189102269164
Now you mention it
his face was familiar to me.	138.83203144468652
But, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	251.94296111859933
—Half a crown, Stephen responded.	386.8106370184507
I daresay he needs it to sleep
somewhere.	259.7443467225278
—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
invariably does.	580.426386620744
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
to his deeds.	282.15149182475034
But, talking about things in general, where, added he
with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	221.05532795173815
Walking to Sandycove is out of
the question.	101.65524098859422
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what
occurred at Westland Row station.	335.8872994935402
Simply fag out there for nothing.	207.41067113492758
I
don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
did you leave your father’s house?	221.33464654188575
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.	477.999856048083
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday.	513.4169527792141
Where does he live at present?	181.39591217908935
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	406.09345133986574
He takes great
pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	300.74719356698716
You could go back perhaps, he
hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
which they did.	342.42650681319276
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on
the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
something like that.	302.825672611947
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust
in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,
Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your
shoes.	590.869635044887
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all
probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	251.68024169040694
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.	253.47167853078204
But it wouldn’t occasion
me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic
was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	277.0191239951008
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a
versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
jealousy, pure and simple.	336.56730464472827
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
your brains, he ventured to throw out.	216.34498626170605
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
himself allowed matters to more or less.	324.76050652189343
Grinding poverty did have that
effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities
though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both
ends meet.	402.77699736206046
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car
round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were
getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a
particularly animated way, there being some little differences between
the parties.	421.0344734809334
—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	1760.8877666719434
Culo rotto!_
	184.79456031736208
_—Intendiamoci.	203.15938669399281
Mezzo sovrano più..._
	526.781250089917
_—Dice lui, però!_
	698.1414049091021
_—Mezzo._
	137.22421879471196
_—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_
	649.3082506705291
_—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._
	1238.5785323230314
Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious
wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	323.6933872192745
A few
moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet
corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous
collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the
genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified
by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked
curiosity.	527.4011435444565
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	339.77671168956454
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
these commodities quietly.	390.3974000984978
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or
whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous
individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still
stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention
to the floor.	579.4736463603288
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:
	300.82968415714566
—A beautiful language.	263.7435640491101
I mean for singing purposes.	321.32853510658845
Why do you not
write your poetry in that language?	172.72179081997925
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious
and full.	344.3080439707657
Voglio._
	29.735702233990914
Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
from lassitude generally, replied:
	340.0475880113272
—To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	218.44944545706167
They were haggling over money.	320.1390032715533
—Is that so?	53.64936247183686
Mr Bloom asked.	255.87999104604643
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that
surrounds it.	364.74251240501496
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a
boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the
table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	305.19179727309677
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to
have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	243.67159054050805
For
which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he
did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	324.69982868113914
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
like names.	287.2465239889951
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	1005.9497775117529
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	494.0867752080217
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	231.53701514501816
What’s in a name?	52.9592598852448
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	644.2355975202604
Of course.	78.83219942323062
Our name
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	365.40176558737693
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
by asking:
	442.4176610860075
—And what might your name be?	140.34611889863947
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
quarter, answered:
	482.03835811077323
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
Hollands and water.	442.27915051318763
—You know Simon Dedalus?	427.0487228047702
he asked at length.	188.4923661797166
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.	199.11900063428212
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
eavesdropping too.	250.6944544746944
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
way and nodding.	290.5089557829142
All Irish.	203.15938669399281
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	691.5568037528269
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when
the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the
shelter with the remark:
	209.87638336879544
—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
shoulder.	410.048531191698
The lefthand dead shot.	663.7356841650912
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	272.9864882324742
—Bottles out there, say.	97.73740145067876
Fifty yards measured.	651.6467422461385
Eggs on the bottles.	85.24627966270407
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	174.2019506086562
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	284.931410838192
Then
he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the
night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	307.9822453056768
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,
there being still a further egg.	772.2123902625568
—Pom! he shouted twice.	207.50122144139
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
bloodthirstily:
	602.5366601594591
_—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
	667.3967656230324
Never missed nor he never will._
	196.89688304371833
A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like
asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
Bisley.	456.9999793436787
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.	158.37961736796504
—Long ago?	119.74476877375427
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	756.6070132840288
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	297.5640800071559
I seen him do that
in Stockholm.	149.64689842826374
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	1132.0686848780367
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.	155.81126904658038
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	106.7296495237354
Know where that is?	68.88820954993334
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	762.3010833513869
—That’s right, the sailor said.	89.31156900774809
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	408.26256885177355
That’s
where I hails from.	302.9197267338991
I belongs there.	210.35610861169135
That’s where I hails from.	302.9197267338991
My
little woman’s down there.	120.52578788905547
She’s waiting for me, I know.	180.1121549480813
_For England,
home and beauty_.	343.3582319010706
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years
now, sailing about.	374.96689766463373
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a
rainy night with a blind moon.	454.8353686872196
Across the world for a wife.	68.82808900921776
Quite a
number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember
Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way
of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	457.470339140145
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
absentee.	299.637512315921
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
his better half, wrecked in his affections.	315.273004578257
You little expected me but
I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	325.12751249678263
There she sits, a grasswidow,
at the selfsame fireside.	331.8329139847418
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
deep.	147.6062943372359
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
onions.	327.0196447161821
No chair for father.	154.80772542040626
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on
her knee, _post mortem_ child.	799.6663622427599
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	416.722284072508
Grin and bear it.	86.32289189911594
I
remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	493.5416338034308
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
of the jarvies with the request:
	220.850469677651
—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	211.43204991351226
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die
of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object
was passed from hand to hand.	232.7590034430692
—Thank you, the sailor said.	71.86923501721151
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
stammers, proceeded:
	283.8363944652112
—We come up this morning eleven o’clock.	247.83015104288913
The threemaster _Rosevean_
from Bridgwater with bricks.	618.7301696335246
Paid off this
afternoon.	194.45675935963146
There’s my discharge.	134.80289634012374
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	352.55132809838807
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
leaning on the counter.	203.5827913116157
—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated
a bit since I first joined on.	467.1020171604071
I was in the Red Sea.	137.42517918976822
I was in China and
North America and South America.	315.13906984675356
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	428.58309107043914
I
seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	1044.2440344328086
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
scuttled a ship.	286.84422056195547
I seen Russia.	315.3464960861451
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	464.672675952932
That’s how the
Russians prays.	217.49357955804425
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.	295.9068996625806
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	407.2262290057108
I seen queer
things too, ups and downs.	455.8465397266838
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
anchor same as I chew that quid.	402.18825098536746
—Khaan! Like that.	136.9004943862381
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
the livers of horses.	405.46611862953813
Look here.	64.56289892777333
Here they are.	67.5661442860951
A friend of mine sent
me.	185.59971403774117
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed
to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	242.06934122410638
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	487.7275212243182
Beni, Bolivia._
	137.22421879471196
All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	559.931668202168
—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	521.1187278746459
Stomachs like
breadgraters.	271.9003690534398
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more
children.	282.3412134155608
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver
raw.	465.3666642057108
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns
for several minutes if not more.	370.43784800408207
—Know how to keep them off?	126.21316719046287
he inquired generally.	511.6030447153317
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
	427.57615020428165
That boggles ’em.	852.9215684497531
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	592.6146382887398
It ran
as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	803.4162851343715
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having
detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he
represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after
having boxed the compass on the strict q.t.	412.9205686900006
somewhere) and the
fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some
Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say
that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was
at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had
consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead
which was his longest.	336.947121634249
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work
a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
with the net result that the scheme fell through.	401.9680704588995
But even suppose it
did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was
not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering
the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there
and back.	265.5015869031253
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone
and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose
liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,
Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive
tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern
Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,
abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	390.47849763099117
Another thing
just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze
around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a
concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure
resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,
Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the
Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly
remunerative.	445.21844285181675
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or
local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise
and I’ll post you the ticket.	439.9609805945617
No, something top notch, an all star
Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal
consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes
and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of
success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some
fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and
thus combine business with pleasure.	460.01995372978854
But who?	53.101614489396674
That was the rub.	86.36795653032257
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was
to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with
the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was
mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments
with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete
fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	319.5486222559775
A great opportunity there certainly
was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public
at large, the average man, i.e.	266.6737751198855
Brown, Robinson and Co.	249.5976425755857
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took
me for a wife.	205.74263326634417
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more
humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the
grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at
her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	301.2485778519985
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there
was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in
Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood
for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds
of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly
grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that
the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering
the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,
rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when
young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off
the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their
left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the
pillar.	414.2981066356633
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
desired.	296.2914524559204
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	224.4013202440143
He turned back the
other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	163.7161419246874
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened
and every pill was something different.	254.24865109341383
One was a ship, another was a
house, another was a flower.	135.840312255483
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly
added, the chinks does.	385.3080262833877
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	350.5259720092365
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	336.1065974766999
Knife in his
back.	52.26863971505814
Knife like that.	51.054530641345096
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	268.6082339914858
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	283.4632569446695
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	205.1610287359111
Like that.	29.63054047888148
_Prepare to
meet your God_, says he.	163.1519283115555
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	162.54189768926685
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to.	498.64930274315367
—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
_stiletto_.	290.43945637890545
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before
in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	348.63084439707956
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
the dark said for the benefit of them all.	171.01391914722709
That was why they thought
the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account
of them using knives.	255.15281449696388
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is
bliss_ Mr B.	516.1227791687226
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
from his boiler affair.	510.8320796149046
His inscrutable face which was really a work of
art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the
impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.	301.6011275342758
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	665.5866142593175
One man was reading in fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.	359.37052662710016
Mr Bloom, so far as
he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	399.8689590285975
He
vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
just turned fifteen.	355.025808284092
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	190.2236485369292
Give us back them papers.	200.48883242667205
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	301.38130829267
Mr Bloom inquired.	665.4339795053003
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
no.	235.96249103977667
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences
but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the
sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	311.0775505188731
—What year would that be about?	128.80350380336205
Mr B interrogated.	622.634476770157
Can you recall the
boats?	184.49608211948976
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
answering:
	1537.7829029977058
—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	150.90941408783755
Salt junk all the time.	154.9733277361655
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	284.9417255502955
His questioner perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
what it meant to rule the waves.	287.8222482673904
On more than one occasion, a dozen at
the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
somewhere sings.	385.4263221289179
And it left him wondering why.	200.8460194734367
Possibly he had tried
to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the
antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not
exactly under, tempting the fates.	190.05231100932696
And the odds were twenty to nil
there was really no secret about it at all.	211.87988968695916
Nevertheless, without going
into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that
the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things
somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence
though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that
sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery
and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for
that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable
institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland
or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like
that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and
coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid
the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that
every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to
capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had
experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	283.50128254554375
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,
himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.	273.1034434058908
Them are his trousers I’ve on me
and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	218.87707670950772
I’m game for that job,
shaving and brushup.	302.3535548497488
I hate roaming about.	401.9971137070367
There’s my son now, Danny,
run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where
he could be drawing easy money.	224.45622762939925
—What age is he?	91.14820516462035
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	321.23410020923245
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	334.37200382918695
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	320.68710403522147
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was
to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent
an anchor.	399.0978297028632
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	310.3794380513555
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	251.77161930122654
It’s them black lads I objects
to.	325.05154734808895
I hate those buggers.	413.3569157985294
Suck your blood dry, they does.	263.8604028300666
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.	240.38273813908089
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	284.2113663649695
That was done when we were lying
becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	433.11529188688337
Fellow, the
name of Antonio, done that.	118.78918115467714
There he is himself, a Greek.	114.0890863893452
—Did it hurt much doing it?	191.59290038538785
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	365.9996240008951
Someway in his.	31.256280656218703
Squeezing or.	41.9124655648472
—See here, he said, showing Antonio.	208.401808390971
There he is cursing the mate.	172.54812779875715
And
there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	213.46972724739203
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
time stretched over.	389.1061827885415
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	302.3247843817339
He’s gone
too.	104.38497188657794
Ate by sharks after.	220.62070846592826
Ay, ay.	117.35867067301098
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
of before.	196.775025535479
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	200.98283714617472
—And what’s the number for?	71.65859145794468
loafer number two queried.	306.34925922997246
—Eaten alive?	167.45840288410398
a third asked the sailor.	162.4454082680146
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time
with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
direction of the questioner about the number.	248.18588073925275
A Greek he was.	106.7996281411653
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his
alleged end:
	447.53640510291257
—As bad as old Antonio,
	229.8817535224158
For he left me on my ownio.	147.71519929078178
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	306.4676516929929
Mr Bloom,
scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
why pink.	252.73663342582725
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round
the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
and begged the chance of his washing.	240.12579559533623
Also why washing which seemed
rather vague than not, your washing.	465.91580728402914
Still candour compelled him to
admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles
street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled
with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they
really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	316.71305892658404
Still
just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than
her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a
rude sign to take herself off.	259.1311788861288
Round the side of the _Evening
Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side
of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was
not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of
gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more
of her.	263.374573241294
—The gunboat, the keeper said.	229.03591008287455
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
senses, if he values his health in the least.	439.68626459593247
Unfortunate creature! Of
course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	530.8533907359192
Still no matter what the cause is from...	125.07029279457974
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
remarking:
	331.6686402087882
—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
roaring trade.	282.5329579111158
She is a bad merchant.	154.90033867377937
She buys dear and sells cheap.	526.3926841915718
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a
prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be
put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart
from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,
were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a
thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a
stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	291.29027872227385
Whoever embarked on a
policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would
confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	346.02237581962584
—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
in the soul.	170.9313514280538
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	253.3351807531789
I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men
as the convolutions of the grey matter.	224.3542217955814
Otherwise we would never have
such inventions as X rays, for instance.	369.27071534645904
Do you?	32.76073075102579
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
and concentrate and remember before he could say:
	284.716336286648
—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
therefore incorruptible.	240.67528723531805
It would be immortal, I understand, but for
the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
being excluded by court etiquette.	511.6433774415869
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
rejoining:
	355.73183939422626
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.	215.4374857524652
Of course, I grant
you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
blue moon.	302.30122169231134
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,
though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour
to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	267.179636631691
—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
evidence.	635.2422632188369
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference
in their respective ages, clashed.	359.9098099748814
—Has been?	73.43998185455747
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
original point with a smile of unbelief.	238.7790686282999
I’m not so sure about that.	132.52423058678957
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the
sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
there.	279.84242788326986
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the
big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.	328.0267202828451
Can’t you drink that
coffee, by the way?	126.69846249609279
Let me stir it.	148.4111964236667
And take a piece of that bun.	152.065418900435
It’s
like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.	246.77095937855293
Still no-one can give what
he hasn’t got.	188.73078153040026
Try a bit.	54.65453709645426
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
moment refusing to dictate further.	365.6312730627952
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with
something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance
(and lucrative) work.	378.2338927139377
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond
yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the
lower orders.	383.91346405011575
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful
recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been
prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration
indeed for her pianoplaying.	335.6232367834222
The idea, he was strongly inclined to
believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to
speak of.	217.18127352208492
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas
he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he
couldn’t remember when it was or where.	289.72790674238706
Anyhow inspection, medical
inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary
which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on
account of the medical analysis involved.	460.75307487999294
—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
stirred.	179.59582974333824
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
took a sip of the offending beverage.	297.04366267164966
—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid
food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental
or manual.	401.88257469913407
You ought to eat more solid food.	333.36029977158785
You would feel a different
man.	156.56738739156478
But O, oblige me by taking away that
knife.	372.39920033735694
I can’t look at the point of it.	95.23639208145555
It reminds me of Roman history.	310.8061343137823
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated
article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly
Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was
the least conspicuous point about it.	387.453798756055
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	683.0428859725654
Do you think they are
genuine?	178.73376074367422
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
lie like old boots.	318.97252627759485
Look at him.	51.83739239098881
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
accurate gospel.	264.1382942006533
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	214.0909823471128
Though a
wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a
jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to
associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill
fraternity.	373.87545859528575
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his
own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he
killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in
durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to
the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our
national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above
described.	326.9811872181275
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable
weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like
those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner
who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
_Hesperus_ and etcetera.	559.2115274533428
And when all was said and done the lies a
fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to
the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	280.92873350947804
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.	207.3992975557036
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	331.8976217372139
Giants,
though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
midget queen.	216.2759679996862
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten
their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
gods.	375.87738674796384
There’s an example again of simple souls.	212.95145962260628
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the
boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
incompatible about it, he conceded.	396.41530244539314
On the contrary that stab in the
back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the
fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in
little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking
fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless
necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to
have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or
her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	318.5981081352088
—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
carry in the abdomen.	365.5249247771461
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	354.67399934253115
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	176.9611952499265
Point of fact she could
actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
(technically) Spain, i.e.	477.06689814536986
She has the Spanish type.	236.67873365708027
Quite
dark, regular brunette, black.	551.6585234100604
I for one certainly believe climate
accounts for character.	416.3329864476389
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
in Italian.	254.41116525801857
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	1873.725852067537
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	800.4042584193066
—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
Tommaso Mastino.	347.9202172625667
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	261.0544739894212
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	355.5985056855621
The splendid
proportions of hips, bosom.	544.4490345238281
You simply don’t knock against those kind
of women here.	263.48149034575346
An exception here and there.	161.4855350811971
Handsome yes, pretty in a
way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.	205.762827361458
Besides
they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly
enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	245.1324248393633
Rumpled
stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a
thing I simply hate to see.	230.84675931040564
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	277.12771696604455
Shipahoy of course
had his own say to say.	101.56550814159763
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	228.5500809311182
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry
Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	321.8908760353103
That was the talk
of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of
original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish
_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore
in commotion petrified with horror.	360.354832331352
Then someone said something about
the case of the s.	93.18174684166536
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_
which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with
all hands on deck.	305.58735793417827
No aid was given.	227.18570002946038
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he
was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	244.8346996379394
She had no water, it
appears, in her hold.	156.31210079062475
At this stage an incident happened.	436.7815526371341
—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	327.59276472484436
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
due left.	243.673791964159
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s
rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew
and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig
out of it with a gurgling noise.	282.46279800584733
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had
a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the
counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was
all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	345.1093100771809
Some
person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by
the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a
brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,
evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the
noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the
ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	362.6432687996158
A hoof scooped
anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	706.810786596876
Slightly
disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of
the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking
up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now
practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin
in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before
shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again
in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its
most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and
familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a
cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass
proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	358.4822691020826
And there he was at the
end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink
without a beggarly stiver.	290.0171526849636
He drank needless to be told and it pointed
only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of
business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his
particular partiality.	243.09918455280925
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra
basin, the only launch that year.	388.08725463284856
Right enough the harbours were there
only no ships ever called.	292.72966122545665
There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
fait_.	425.2309040463551
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
Worthington or some name like that, eh?	347.3431258469555
Ask the then captain, he
advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that
day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	327.8804249921233
—Am I right, skipper?	532.0212491088472
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
private potation and the rest of his exertions.	201.8773299706707
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or
other in seconds or thirds.	318.94905313624866
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then
expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have
lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and
making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in
question.	236.62898518686373
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful
libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the
_soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:
	474.79192543745364
—The biscuits was as hard as brass
	269.96923278765354
And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.	242.589230617119
O, Johnny Lever!
	494.0867752080217
Johnny Lever, O!
	494.0867752080217
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
provided.	431.65143913525685
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none
on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal
in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every
year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained
out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through
the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot
more surplus steam in the same vein.	350.28225978713255
Their conversation accordingly
became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	258.52548950587885
You could grow any
mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel
Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	418.6447972545395
But a day of reckoning, he stated
_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the
conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
pelf on account of her crimes.	360.67534845591126
There would be a fall and the greatest
fall in history.	149.62436048280827
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their
little lookin, he affirmed.	232.5966115056202
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be
Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the
vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at
once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the
tendon referred to on his boot.	369.8442138016283
His advice to every Irishman was: stay
in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	237.07164979836392
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	233.9511288581508
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	208.58803652589756
The
impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	1622.5070234344512
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	423.0614564193284
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	384.8223678368504
—Who’s the best troops in the army?	119.47655992831484
the grizzled old veteran irately
interrogated.	1115.5007872222045
And the best jumpers and racers?	229.02983372054624
And the best admirals
and generals we’ve got?	298.270296639878
Tell me that.	48.725554143421725
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	230.61850850839645
The Irish catholic
peasant.	803.5885601003426
He’s the backbone of our empire.	145.78444649021952
You know Jem Mullins?	427.0487228047702
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no
Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	359.98999564014673
Then they began to have a
few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,
appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with
interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to
blows.	303.42010477308
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he
was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the
channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,
rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	385.2290188262563
It was quite on a
par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred
million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out
and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all
he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of
contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it
was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both
countries even though poles apart.	251.15243825307098
Another little interesting point,
the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,
reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against
her, more so, in fact.	333.24509944570707
And now, why?	108.47706326496005
So the scene between the pair of
them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,
the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him
forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,
that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human
soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	235.85805485076355
And as for the
lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.)
couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people
like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and
refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private
life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a
Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like
Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	294.82632641623246
Quite apart from
that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	343.28422273795206
In any case
that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo
Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	288.4726243680856
He ought
to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	257.5697403546436
Like actresses,
always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	610.0069156563516
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any
idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	219.61899791167352
So
similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid
of some £.	415.5750798749909
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in
the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin
and so on.	218.11703665602298
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the
same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually
silenced the offender.	252.12273932970888
—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	443.102588858217
He called me a jew and
in a heated fashion offensively.	216.09146927443362
A soft answer turns away wrath.	563.4750975960411
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as
everyone saw.	188.7044448021147
Am I not right?	208.42139531144753
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.	237.41841174592832
—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
other, _secundum carnem_.	509.2524023604116
—Of course, Mr B.	480.0403336204042
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
of the question.	183.60843682631568
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
government it deserves.	314.0014566748859
But with a little goodwill all round.	150.05266135661486
It’s all
very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual
equality.	334.0747892885861
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	464.4676252439553
It
never reaches anything or stops anything.	435.90164354495914
A revolution must come on the
due instalments plan.	411.5620917312012
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
in the next house so to speak.	188.81154049703545
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen
assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.	771.842551887298
Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
was overwhelmingly right.	699.608961544531
And the whole world was full of that sort of
thing.	116.14620210014127
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	109.35658498446908
A hocuspocus of
conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...	545.1386224175277
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad
blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	320.2864030494336
—They accuse, remarked he audibly.	647.9832671639829
He turned away from the others, who
probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…
	170.5007645392704
—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of
ruining.	301.5257403195092
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.	268.1326040060536
History, would
you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer
for, imported them.	438.5152398164065
Because they are imbued with the proper
spirit.	219.10996670458204
They are practical and are proved to be so.	175.5853379015388
I don’t want to
indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and
then orthodox as you are.	184.5583085579312
But in the economic, not touching religion,
domain the priest spells poverty.	415.5542550543252
Spain again, you saw in the war,
compared with goahead America.	273.4402367537211
It’s in the dogma.	81.07516276696575
Because if
they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d
try to live better, at least so I think.	294.44737689264275
That’s the juggle on which the
p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.	210.36928412347984
I’m, he resumed with dramatic
force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the
outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes
_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion
either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.	465.2895077688639
That’s the
vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of
friendlier intercourse between man and man.	260.63329185406394
At least that’s my idea for
what it’s worth.	139.04834648121906
I call that patriotism.	220.95568047447273
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a
smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	573.8089954482261
Where
you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	159.01971036471772
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	326.1776794155456
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
beneath or seemed to.	288.14051171551364
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	122.63892664221383
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	262.97459542910804
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
who owned them pro tem.	350.9154429719421
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
must work, have to, together.	210.49936132830223
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
possible sense.	243.15634313907378
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
thing.	200.37779068815718
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
nowadays.	292.9512437910867
That’s work too.	103.31406809990172
Important work.	92.28130011859567
After all, from the little I
know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	256.6369595735286
You have every bit
as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
peasant has.	241.469132190984
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	225.63703159613007
Each is equally important.	325.68958914433085
—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
Ireland for short.	490.80645792882433
—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	607.8598948640663
—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
because it belongs to me.	517.2815794354243
—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
some misapprehension.	787.5701011584048
Excuse me.	43.12221257392657
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the
latter portion.	413.60989132213615
What was it you...?	47.976465621333965
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:
	447.33977813342676
—We can’t change the country.	144.86675124384396
Let us change the subject.	158.1116941926371
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction
to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	334.79296296973166
The rebuke of some
kind was clearer than the other part.	256.02427197695926
Needless to say the fumes of his
recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
foreign to his sober state.	291.7715874824826
Probably the homelife to which Mr B
attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he
hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	286.24040167665066
With a touch of
fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an
air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in
the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	325.8732070799328
For
instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy
faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad
vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a
nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously
sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	345.69355581548547
And then the usual
_dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed
into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a
strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so
as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law
amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not
divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	337.9173626705172
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly
turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and
the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in
the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,
then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high
personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,
he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running
counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before
under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good
Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the
reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women
chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being
largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	266.53950526899814
Ladies who like
distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,
trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of
a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned
his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the
cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a
continental.	349.89060116531743
However, reverting to the original, there were on the
other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest
rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	206.9566991905287
Sheer force of natural genius,
that.	228.64295148378775
With brains, sir.	229.206474175688
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad
having in fact let himself in for it.	220.64589193600358
Still to cultivate the
acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
for reflection would amply repay any small.	486.9808343369964
Intellectual stimulation,
as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the
mind.	209.86534373198387
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,
row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,
the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of
the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,
viz.	278.5449367410341
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the
microscope lately.	591.871260584176
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he
might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy
if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the
common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea
per column.	349.67871699210093

Though

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing
though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to
congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	328.53647935562327
Guesswork it
reduced itself to eventually.	274.5481655534682
—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	235.99459603932277
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	152.4193540520236
He bet them what they liked.	219.1062073640242

He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for
a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
no-one to point a finger at him.	238.06977263465816
Then they would all to a man have gone
down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his
senses.	163.48087024956754
Dead he wasn’t.	110.55761266091085
Simply absconded somewhere.	589.4062608236311
The coffin they
brought over was full of stones.	207.11988641140758
He changed his name to De Wet, the
Boer general.	313.03831677998653
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	179.50020905114042
And so forth and
so on.	97.91949249444318
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
was twenty odd years.	294.99351252066936
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
inadvisable, all things considered.	262.09231076273124
Something evidently riled them in
his death.	245.38692714692604
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just
when his various different political arrangements were nearing
completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having
neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold
resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his
room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a
fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find
the job was taken out of their hands.	355.35674870514276
Of course nobody being acquainted
with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his
whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order
even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and
Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within
the bounds of possibility.	400.06441580323747
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as
a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,
a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged
feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on
the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were
very few and far between.	332.48010011317825
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with
feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on
him with mutual mudslinging.	348.6687536449116
And the identical same with murderers.	224.33519638680525
You
had to come back.	90.72537235565154
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	291.6686489129395
To show the
understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	214.20995808643937
He saw him once on the
auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_
or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in
point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he
said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid
exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the
cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.	283.0009412573266
Still as regards return.	269.0085565111443
You
were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got
back.	235.22855178227354
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and
Harry against.	332.69056136444317
And then, number one, you came up against the man in
possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the
Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to
the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence
went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew
was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some
pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description
given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or
some such commonplace remark.	273.0062068730992
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to
the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under
discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land
first.	238.14540936994175
—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
commented.	447.46243460322717
She put the first nail in his coffin.	148.77608571638052
—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	291.8160925224144
She loosened many a man’s thighs.	273.51995205842104
I seen her picture in a barber’s.	158.1497303263737
The husband was a captain or an
officer.	210.53232607032913
—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	265.54193179565766
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	514.7855863473538
As regards Bloom he, without
the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the
door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
between them full of sweet nothings.	316.35265824184864
First it was strictly Platonic
till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till
bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of
the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not
a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his
downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to
anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed
into.	337.9592433274569
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared
favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the
rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared
her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went
through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape
of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a
particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment
with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained
admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the
lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	295.57506922369686
Whereas the
simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not
being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the
name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of
weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home
ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.	221.09105287450913
The eternal
question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.	325.04760831069893
Can real
love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist
between married folk?	375.8875371996658
Though it was no concern of theirs
absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of
folly.	294.60613707104056
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented
obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military
supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my
gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th
hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,
that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,
woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame
which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the
gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved
evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts
of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that
exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his
matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in
the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.	355.22591503202375
Looking back now in a
retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	188.66525556805422
And then
coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without
saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the
times.	201.81661859373568
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not
been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as
it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	243.57180621623107
North or south,
however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
every shred of decency to the winds.	306.3316565659571
—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
Stephen, about blood and the sun.	247.99533586468877
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she
was Spanish too.	361.3780202562245
—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
so many.	309.935109246888
—Was she?	39.93019424155908
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
means, I never heard that rumour before.	571.3418960564244
Possible, especially there, it
was as she lived there.	153.2886871925059
So, Spain.	203.15938669399281
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out
his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained
rapidly finally he.	286.4303085993102
—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	227.46325540108788
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,
standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which
was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all
the vogue.	323.0172953620929
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about
to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland
street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the
esthetic execution.	408.9880460295833
—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
indicated.	985.9054633520602
Taken a few years since.	162.34436360714693
In or about ninety six.	269.0523631052915
Very like
her then.	76.9884868893915
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage
in that getup.	176.45688864322977
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for
the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	255.00505025706792
He dwelt,
being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in
general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as
works of art, in the National Museum.	317.5865094427333
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a
word.	223.94901964766927
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to
speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the
beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in
itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	240.77075042265585
But it was
scarcely professional etiquette so.	305.6748659875903
Though it was a warm pleasant sort
of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for
sunshine after storm.	302.48057883762107
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to
follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by
moving a motion.	219.10655428635664
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly
soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear
however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further
increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her
symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	462.40450439360797
In fact the slight soiling was only
an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,
much better in fact with the starch out.	300.17465575563307
Suppose she was gone when he?	93.41016031475071
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely
as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning
littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses
(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately
beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	329.8703704503979
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
_distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of
the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.	221.1150225276755
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it
was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	168.82862460566102
And why not?	91.22683212557567
An
awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a
lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same
old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or
the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about
the whole business.	461.2127945051055
How they were fated to meet and an attachment
sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the
public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy
and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they
openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside
hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in
due course intimate.	375.8035943962526
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor
tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made
absolute.	365.23039564852286
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they
largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they
very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor
who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	256.4613998072534
He, B,
enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the
flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen
leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when
clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the
number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated
into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United
Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up
the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of
some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite
scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile
tribune’s private morals.	332.89747817294574
Though palpably a radically altered man he
was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with
that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the
shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that
their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which
she, however, was the first to perceive.	328.40469383346505
As those were particularly hot
times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a
nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated
lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a
grave character.	324.0626155553533
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently
knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who
picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to
return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)
who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat
at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the
country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos
of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into
him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good
form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and
thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in
a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	238.6795617831339
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter
from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the
crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.	290.50601202890255
He personally, being of a
sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about
saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	324.1654888965912
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last
him his lifetime.	311.52263303184355
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day
take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the
interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the
gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump
Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular
lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as
to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl
courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to
their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of
complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and
flowers and chocs.	349.1196074972242
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some
landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	350.42291043991946
The
queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who
was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something
substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made
on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty
Dumpty boiled.	388.68050415226213
—At what o’clock did you dine?	235.53413723821953
he questioned of the slim form and tired
though unwrinkled face.	322.367740090695
—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	290.96466268385427
—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
Friday.	448.86759791327216
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!
	139.05928154534985
—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.	388.112423830817
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	513.2770634262383
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
one train of thought.	230.05930553168616
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some
score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a
sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	399.0201317579353
For instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted
with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	374.8530974177232
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	180.0289479557623
The crux was it was
a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.	325.84932401917337
On the
other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which
of the two alternatives.	177.07103238467116
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved
him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things
considered.	183.75162750633876
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or
not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	298.03644184280984
For one thing he mightn’t
what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried
him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in
his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	277.4566209159863
At all events he wound up
by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of
Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two
and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands
and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast
amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort
was kicked up.	286.2605181350455
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t
appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly
beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse
of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would
be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few
days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with
sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to
freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized
charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment
of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for
as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as
Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	405.605034527585
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over
his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being
a jew.	258.46348656035525
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what
properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	262.03079605914905
The most vulnerable point
too of tender Achilles.	441.34045851351897
Your god was a jew.	98.69564225936521
Because mostly they
appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts
in the county Sligo.	345.6985111933678
—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come
home with me and talk things over.	461.66806221915937
My diggings are quite close in the
vicinity.	290.4468954574637
You can’t drink that stuff.	194.5746735220526
Do you like cocoa?	146.75891438057616
I’ll
just pay this lot.	268.5207836331661
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the
keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.	366.09256346939287
—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	198.74129162640216
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,
education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from
the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.	428.9153986921928
An opening was all was
wanted.	154.0091263635871
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association
dinner in London somewhere.	331.2172517353299
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
thrilling announcement.	368.0300700148383
Then the old specimen in the corner who
appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony
MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to
that effect.	275.5131737535193
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered
why.	490.2238843821531
—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	388.04744779024907
—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	568.9450822100159
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	279.00895742598465
—Are you bad in the eyes?	72.20355457587084
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
queried.	496.5816100468209
—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a
bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	366.1043236348664
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	170.224712394432
One time I could read a book in the
dark, manner of speaking.	197.38269651741192
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my
favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._
	350.9306724506128
Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
remark.	440.8565154527933
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four
coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	326.01837361260965
—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	224.29757424251864
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and
company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
_dolce far niente_.	325.063962155082
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	226.59886695519987
—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
the moment.	171.85175875788286
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
upside down, on the tables in cafés.	443.02737326894817
To which impromptu the
neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying
straight off:
	479.9519666222074
—To sweep the floor in the morning.	120.69695016478438
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the
bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	300.79360823523416
The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
weak on his pins.	261.25135542005063
—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a
moment.	173.63293756428752
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.	169.8295940446131
It’s not far.	91.12399423058424
Lean on me.	51.610133890335256
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on
accordingly.	189.18156016947748
—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
all that.	233.85954231313033
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	349.0594294335609
where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
of fresh fields and pastures new.	326.5794042282186
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	272.1881891550763
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	316.52512115501605
Wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_,
Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_
he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
into a cocked hat.	305.1540121906343
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the
catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line
such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live
thy protestant to be_.	377.2858788538461
He also yielded to none in his admiration of
Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and
putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church
in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	393.3952837798359
There was the
unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
a generally voiced desire for an encore.	194.11961349066362
On the whole though favouring
preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	372.1737404488132
And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha,
M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from
the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of
the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	317.52199849104835
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but
launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or
about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near
Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an
instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,
whom B.	485.09896306830126
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded
familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_
and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he
said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one
Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	398.7436391223857
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to
sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	424.47678160525805
He inquired if it was John Bull the
political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical
names, as a striking coincidence.	329.89569837542103
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,
Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s
sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:
	454.7347189990068
—Our lives are in peril tonight.	313.1849391431276
Beware of the steamroller.	82.87445786331675
They thereupon stopped.	641.8502714294691
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even
flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a
blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot
foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with
his thoughts.	288.7207225041249
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump
of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared
for every emergency that might crop up.	303.5301835975021
He was just a big nervous
foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	219.4591948580803
But
even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the
same size, would be a holy horror to face.	225.8363403889714
But it was no animal’s fault
in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	276.76537830862213
Nine tenths of them
all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring
the bees.	324.2635160524845
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of
his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my
eagle eye.	337.011928277631
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field
occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the
ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly
interesting old.	318.35960737084383
—What’s this I was saying?	180.63934047085684
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in
medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	396.2884428917721
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after
as he was perhaps not that way built.	285.7971624298983
Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it
opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish
industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in
general.	337.26279575369546
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
come from.	408.1243372941743
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
which boggled Bloom a bit:
	322.63570394064794
Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
	1165.3198457737649
Tun die Poeten dichten.	942.6524768812535
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	522.7711814374399
Bloom, nodding,
said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
he did.	194.14674040921324
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could
easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice
production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the
bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and
procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into
fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial
magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his
university degree of B.	423.63641063363144
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly
bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would
infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which
also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his
clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into
their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial
niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate
against you.	337.84401090241903
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily
foresee him participating in their musical and artistic
_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for
choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and
being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away,
he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.	254.91861041929144
Added
to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be
sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	226.21733974552092
Not, he
parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily
embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of
time.	321.9733023530631
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and
both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity
in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a
cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	307.4774103787907
Besides, though
taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,
different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue
as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the
usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public
by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	528.5471973715009
Yes,
beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and
he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high
place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,
booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street
house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,
so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort
to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too
much fêted prince of good fellows.	264.7907746143832
And it need not detract from the
other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time
to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing
without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything
derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	328.1318792936058
In fact, he
had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,
possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,
hung on to him at all.	175.21861306908488
The horse was just then.	140.32987661205792
And later on at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side
of a person’s character, no pun intended.	411.6065366444721
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted
and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting
fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three
smoking globes of turds.	383.0455125414266
Slowly three times, one after another, from a
full crupper he mired.	282.16324123511146
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)
had ended, patient in his scythed car.	382.122575829464
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	346.20348489977
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	1562.9163725411372
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
Father Maher_.	392.21644617082944
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of
other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the
kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in
the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they
were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner
street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	309.8702001717334
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	708.8352815561294
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,
bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	475.6213188579244
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the
circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle
being less than the arc which it subtends.	496.40041335477866
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	410.7699509227962
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.	613.4854189506922
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	660.5044649144602
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial.	568.3576826040663
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	300.05005743319975
Both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	978.6713950642047
Both admitted the
alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism.	681.794022160401
Were their views on some points divergent?	346.81508397873233
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	433.6021923539575
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism
involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign
of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt
(† 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
and interred at Rossnaree.	442.4225420916578
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric
inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
no bigger than a woman’s hand.	528.0295463160527
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	250.61427994257724
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
paraheliotropic trees.	375.5901746161189
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
the past?	694.9470440261722
In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and
Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield
avenue.	428.94414546624887
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the
wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of
Uppercross.	465.06551585496385
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines.	763.9873706658858
In 1888 frequently with major
Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.	490.0387808035722
Once
in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both
occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street,
west.	284.80835564772826
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
their destination?	871.9602942539254
As in what ways?	105.9972197716577
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from
existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	223.7767681448083
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?	353.0174794116784
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,
number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back
pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	310.4325491042278
Was it there?	52.000138054699796
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding.	148.2776525296932
Why was he doubly irritated?	264.9330026858576
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget.	178.34972873195488
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	420.7262222086937
To enter or not to enter.	194.8927429222282
To knock or not to knock.	164.4775441186256
Bloom’s decision?	170.8176240599896
A stratagem.	464.672675952932
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.	303.49348492524535
Did he fall?	90.6653161545688
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era
five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand
three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.	652.4522523824525
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	393.99557126675563
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame
which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit
finally a portable candle.	511.32159303389744
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	1037.295030499861
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	314.0692544530564
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	261.0404731825612
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor.	361.14815371157306
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	516.9221153048446
In the open
space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his
candle.	154.10275952443317
Did Stephen obey his sign?	447.1543804265136
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and
followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and
lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and
carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the
kitchen of Bloom’s house.	260.449818482903
What did Bloom do?	215.70152620673952
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three
projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby
releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its
carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen
of the air.	459.26373626987197
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	493.25839679970494
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of
his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of
his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.	359.35737844627226
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
the fire towards the opposite wall?	195.02118151596113
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.	633.1379003140157
What did Bloom see on the range?	185.92013608960178
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
(larger) hob a black iron kettle.	443.5725314338725
What did Bloom do at the range?	192.9824302207787
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
let it flow.	237.25991065363294
Did it flow?	116.27544248804071
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen
of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a
distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving
tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace
bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and
daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the
sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	608.7933626082869
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire?	461.6152490058328
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the
Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,
photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning
moon.	769.538345975243
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
return to the stillflowing tap?	289.32704628123486
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in
a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	520.6866299739484
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?	518.3106617466257
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the
month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous
substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and
language.	412.65221700260474
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	365.9430073462873
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	398.57130923073515
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	892.3168053968726
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	171.51510561171028
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation.	253.96755248372838
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire?	259.01003278573063
The phenomenon of ebullition.	264.4542355238387
Fanned by a constant updraught of
ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
ether.	655.3163538849069
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,
was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of
calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the
temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.	464.37913039730665
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	278.0925475050042
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously.	526.3823383336588
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	397.999775710891
To shave himself.	272.4359420269011
What advantages attended shaving by night?	583.8291390324849
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if
unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at
incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a
cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal
noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a
postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,
relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he
sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving
and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected
and applied adhered: which was to be done.	550.4339394910512
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	341.65541001585024
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
feminine passive active hand.	272.3453780016795
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
influence?	302.56089651736863
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
surgery.	575.6900016901496
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	347.04051325946256
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	941.2018055858698
On the middle shelf a
chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink
tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne
Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a
cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two
onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,
bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a
quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,
acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity
subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one
imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a
halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak.	648.7066736503912
On the
upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and
proveniences.	414.14559934972067
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	218.61463095582107
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
numbered 8 87, 88 6.	1419.0471666701296
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	687.7344837450938
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.	376.97572061104336
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
been received by him?	330.5488585186714
In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in
O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had
placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising
Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the
premises of F.	516.5567870385382
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,
when Frederick M.	814.6615225886882
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively
requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the
_Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to
throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the
oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,
with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	294.04517247245917
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	1043.3809905415494
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by
failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
originally from a successful interpretation.	556.8390793948487
His mood?	265.9995197036967
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
was satisfied.	226.81840338553698
What satisfied him?	168.91407280621607
To have sustained no positive loss.	468.1924426103629
To have brought a positive gain to
others.	272.75937748232207
Light to the gentiles.	77.46062808907715
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	345.2652152395659
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
prescribed.	361.5322094771985
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest?	415.83198681758205
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality?	236.73246633922207
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he
accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s
massproduct, the creature cocoa.	375.87059670879205
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
complete the act begun?	346.86800584729207
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
side of his guest’s jacket.	261.89632082516755
A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
condition.	182.2652230477544
Who drank more quickly?	273.89335678158676
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and
taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a
steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one,
six to two, nine to three.	262.7319267518513
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	775.2088084179683
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived
from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself
had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	347.5664698519322
Had he found their solution?	184.7054720693901
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
the answers not bearing in all points.	402.587531739043
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the
offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for
competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	355.96039799818556
An ambition to squint
	363.09810816868077
At my verses in print
	255.9935278634076
Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.	194.72869723841495
If you so condescend
	186.55931713337256
Then please place at the end
	141.69311173306994
The name of yours truly, L.	349.27813130692806
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	350.7177470530301
Name, age, race, creed.	569.654137936536
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	181.31395525458018
Leopold Bloom
Ellpodbomool
Molldopeloob
Bollopedoom
Old Ollebo, M.	1500.5868986082914
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?	467.274981195918
Poets oft have sung in rhyme
	468.9070253643245
Of music sweet their praise divine.	464.3289630748974
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	368.44592793749894
Dearer far than song or wine.	299.4914126215218
The world is mine.	156.59387993035907
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	432.13894868087584
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the
grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	496.37775312548354
Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by
George A.	1157.3659778113151
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke
and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,
associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new
high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
Barton.	603.7193183261497
What relation existed between their ages?	630.3598455422673
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen
was 6.	347.979152807793
16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present
age Bloom would be 54.	347.3573728854951
What events might nullify these calculations?	810.8983967588113
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	304.15738574986534
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	1053.5244214882223
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina
Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
hand in salutation.	282.00384587001463
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on
a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s
father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.	277.99407981563803
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
afterwards seconded by the father?	269.4742079054245
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	861.377251720333
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
third connecting link between them?	375.1759887761323
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
house of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891
and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City
Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during
parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of
Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in
the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence
of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular
road.	421.1273179703439
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	282.09138512334044
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with
slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had
remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	628.1263302187697
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	228.58535031821674
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	436.8338077130219
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
deceased?	409.1720842173083
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the
statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for
Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	568.8647707736618
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
more desirable?	362.46038527343933
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	556.1226110086642
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	382.3310106846795
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally
developed abdominal muscles.	441.2811018825655
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	698.8175331938504
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts
about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about
Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?	459.92088264189135
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
knew that he knew that he was not.	113.0424268629226
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
parentages?	449.8647168626221
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag
(subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,
London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius
Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	803.2907404212364
Stephen, eldest
surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin
and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	565.8623820899505
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
layman?	385.950069233281
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	464.90542547557857
A., alone,
in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	482.5664570504663
C., in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	165.31289969427385
Stephen (once) by the
reverend Charles Malone C.	362.5073161754662
C., alone, in the church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar.	197.91804726089902
Did they find their educational careers similar?	496.6380386156661
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
through a dame’s school and the high school.	303.0865170140273
Substituting Bloom for
Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
royal university.	449.3288673437563
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the
university of life?	293.024712837128
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to
him.	230.31181366993854
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	558.3604131231593
The scientific.	317.5334699131929
The artistic.	236.73282115525478
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
applied, rather than towards pure, science?	592.6871627353339
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in
a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	480.9862629344106
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
kindergarten?	703.7638325009243
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults.	1507.9993021728244
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to
correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
historically costumed dolls.	1468.347231555485
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	255.30288148497854
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	861.5255381333346
James,
the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at
his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in
triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
convince, to decide.	637.9960455458557

Beware of imitations.	132.2783087204142
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
seated engaged in writing.	387.9055120613716
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	417.4549226865744
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	259.16250489233653
Fire lit.	186.17845725706465

seizes solitary paper.	547.8908560730285
He holds it towards fire.	234.4551786536198

Queen’s Ho...	136.70385447397808
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	440.17873880311936
The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered
in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite
liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m.	513.0816573360723
on
the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of
having, purchased at 3.15 p.m.	426.0291282386833
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
intuition?	448.0721002611103
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?	202.87340464205667
He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s
words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
relieved.	363.24204312862486
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
Parable of the Plums_?	290.2473597915483
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
(e.g.	499.79265198832246
_My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in
conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of
successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful
achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following
the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,
21 June (S.	659.2514896041068
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.	936.496978150428
Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
frequently engaged his mind?	327.88616203610997
What to do with our wives.	133.3877523376399
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	467.61864011869676
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,
piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope
addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial
activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress
proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine
satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state
inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular
infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive
superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised
respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction
specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	1082.2109960692842
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	395.43689202948457
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
Hebrew characters.	407.2743710398525
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
a city in Canada, Quebec.	290.76863364619055
She understood little of political
complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	541.6475687299746
In calculating
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	525.4778508214833
After
completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the
implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the
corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	598.4030079322584
Unusual
polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by
false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_
(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	675.2254768928755
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	352.86022483687594
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
balances, proved true by construction.	549.5113181244702
The counterbalance of her
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by
experiment.	532.9488601825702
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	339.2390538525125
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s
ignorant lapse.	410.9506738101354
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	430.4322990073709
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
with error.	466.67062330406264
What system had proved more effective?	526.726898327897
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	1218.1427628516
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	338.63087410627537
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of
postexilic eminence did he adduce?	384.4806983378445
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)
there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	518.9254061407844
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
Stephen?	553.0607535160742
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
name uncertain.	348.8920587464357
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
selected or rejected race mentioned?	351.1860032742152
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	3056.097782515782
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
by guest to host and by host to guest?	340.23590218704334
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	1084.1852501353983
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple
amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	859.6194247586681
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	335.1027494828871
By juxtaposition.	464.672675952932
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence
of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as
ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.	547.9769393379108
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	299.370748161471
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	674.4596903734108
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
peoples who spoke them?	364.92169988566144
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the
seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor
of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:
their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,
homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures
comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and
Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,
Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival
and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical
rites in ghetto (S.	736.2942363991964
Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s
tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and
jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the
possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	484.3783173413151
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
ethnically irreducible consummation?	866.0758509437404
Kolod balejwaw pnimah
	1247.7144807542668
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	1247.7144807542668
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	219.58999647084315
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.	408.5243367029831
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	344.3746278570166
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	266.4824094620887
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	575.0271895646354
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	663.0370695392213
Did the guest comply with his host’s request?	211.85083182510314
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	400.90505408246537
What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?	411.4544979520596
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
of the past.	296.2625532194364
What was Bloom’s visual sensation?	381.34380165800025
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
future.	236.7605090588445
What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional
quasisensations of concealed identities?	564.5841352306562
Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	898.8231237664778
Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of
catastrophe.	410.44916880489353
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
what exemplars?	243.00785190310748
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
reverend John Conmee S.	581.6412472008417
J., the reverend T.	160.51622865098835
Salmon, D.	203.15938669399281
D., provost of
Trinity college, Dr Alexander J.	837.8681128514642
At the bar, English or Irish:
exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	720.3415993101358
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	770.5244035147354
On the stage,
modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,
Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.	1016.7329024064005
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a
strange legend on an allied theme?	349.49027115516174
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
plus cocoa, having been consumed.	850.7600601600584
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	282.78505941039907
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
	274.30178177944515
Went out for to play ball.	137.9969643250458
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
	364.4585940154297
He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.	247.78787126530156
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
	393.2045549637376
He broke the jew’s windows all.	170.1670494186001
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	230.79729774732675
With unmixed feeling.	677.7635702549006
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw
the unbroken kitchen window.	208.3620768995104
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	165.17524485951364
Then out there came the jew’s daughter
	136.9134814440329
“Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
	218.72257325599648
And play your ball again.”
	259.815078530473
I can’t come back and I won’t come back
	216.73763983020436
Without my schoolfellows all.	195.53134900706397
For if my master he did hear
	146.99558174423768
He’d make it a sorry ball.”
	202.77023077815048
She took him by the lilywhite hand
	157.80691363908377
And led him along the hall
	164.7830178655055
Until she led him to a room
	117.2684633891816
Where none could hear him call.	222.51676299643
She took a penknife out of her pocket
	152.6146425641216
And cut off his little head.	166.46939835647086
And now he’ll play his ball no more
	171.620499553189
For he lies among the dead.	141.32092875444962
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	231.97901727066096
With mixed feelings.	447.0116797397721
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s
daughter, all dressed in green.	159.1714540215569
Condense Stephen’s commentary.	389.35413409094366
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	113.67919442388927
Once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	387.6901873964785
It comes when
he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of
hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	278.35297755546685
It leads him to a strange
habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,
immolates him, consenting.	414.3038313856521
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	315.711969644621
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told.	171.513966977963
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	277.033449425086
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	171.45815087727948
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	279.0045509694784
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	422.12031026222274
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune?	365.6178929833608
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	482.18761011483275
From
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled
in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its
destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.	508.3299794722972
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?	381.21846813796503
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an
exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two
figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	328.77274295900133
What other infantile memories had he of her?	178.4839854646832
15 June 1889.	494.0867752080217
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
lessen congestion.	900.1999379350518
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
navy.	797.4965326829431
What endemic characteristics were present?	823.1301022302291
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line
of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	462.34871134355865
What memories had he of her adolescence?	180.83465303838304
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	365.10640123291734
On
the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an
individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and
turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	357.6003536226398
On the vigil of the
15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
not stated).	352.1505367605032
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	407.63190746939637
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	241.54949420024735
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
if differently?	503.19769407078996
A temporary departure of his cat.	253.4222526820009
Why similarly, why differently?	553.8346835751986
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian).	366.9833508458682
Differently,
because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
habitation.	195.09038409063288
In other respects were their differences similar?	446.807263611745
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
unexpectedness.	268.7837572660795
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
for her (cf neckarching cat).	327.99199443332276
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
mousewatching cat).	511.8180930034215
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,
issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	396.60264175830446
Furthermore, silly Milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a
horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
hearthdreaming cat).	402.01534007178947
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct
of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	294.16221403575344
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of
the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and
the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,
_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical
progression.	488.7731492462521
In what manners did she reciprocate?	307.12156811457544
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	438.7154204891129
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had
been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
necessities, anticipating his desires.	353.0895926135122
She admired: a natural
phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the
immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of
his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	345.1275028014554
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,
make to Stephen, noctambulist?	870.4205785515378
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess.	404.0422951216277
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a
prolongation of such an extemporisation?	368.28267366395954
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study.	279.1249018315927
For the
host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	413.0744880671034
For the
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
pronunciation.	720.7552277866686
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?	433.19766559615914
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
through daughter.	171.94253812746976
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
return a monosyllabic negative answer?	410.9226546768626
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at
Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.	844.564543126005
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
host?	681.7276534385386
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	445.36514077267935
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	262.40120084235497
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	540.2406330437572
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	303.46711660019554
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£
1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
the former.	397.8972737961075
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	1496.383522283959
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
residence of the instructed.	322.6042234777036
To inaugurate a course of vocal
instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	265.3071874831946
To inaugurate a
series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident
in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street
(W.	537.9622482822201
and E.	203.15938669399281
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10
Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles
street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a
conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection
of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were
resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	447.2794449454448
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions?	754.6507908996922
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
(the clown’s) papa.	360.1446912101914
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
received by J.	287.5509181327839
and T.	203.15938669399281
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
circuitous or direct, return.	732.1477588972433
Was the clown Bloom’s son?	209.44607577272222
Had Bloom’s coin returned?	423.2746088097946
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	282.23959580659823
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
international animosity.	458.048455168932
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,
eliminating these conditions?	616.9637865093395
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
maturity to decay.	600.5461083796491
Why did he desist from speculation?	292.89776628118113
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
to be removed.	266.3459141433823
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	453.1385726115127
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon
the incertitude of the void.	385.50798588368684
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	524.6936687948908
Not verbally.	317.5334699131929
What comforted his misapprehension?	502.6367903367578
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	224.4664917388474
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the
exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation
effected?	245.43321394206274
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN
	738.7738780741503
With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	582.9637039603833
The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de
populo barbaro_.	3096.904526673105
What did each do at the door of egress?	144.9482210592635
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	130.4710174804645
Stephen put the hat on his
head.	90.21834970954869
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	163.3866090588521
For a cat.	82.17833232196053
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	261.7510377175194
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	694.0978529807497
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations?	426.1747042722881
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of
Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)
distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	564.5404358684638
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	749.8342148621942
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of
the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences
concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives
and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the
incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible
molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single
pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white
bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other
bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies
of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component
bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division
till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never
reached.	587.2101581592242
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	326.5925263999833
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of
the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such
magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power
of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes
of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would
have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its
printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds
of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of
every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to
the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.	371.7382466064464
Of a different order of difficulty.	187.98802814606918
Conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the
line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	578.4170405443283
And the problem of possible redemption?	204.79079235143814
The minor was proved by the major.	239.424734701591
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	262.7150819129577
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin
of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the
birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric
showers about the period of the feast of S.	557.6893703602829
Lawrence (martyr, 10
August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon
in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the
period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about
the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of
(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about
the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the
constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph
Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of
wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of
nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	358.16838675207885
His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and
allowing for possible error?	493.24903297538214
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
a heavenman.	202.09436747974695
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and
of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in
space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as
a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence.	387.6423651755316
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	184.60804068127803
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet.	286.08200678893104
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?	443.7149448228513
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	351.44534287252276
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman?	258.5588584834958
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,
when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	531.2247330488111
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,
gaze?	720.2974708311646
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and
revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.	580.3903872742978
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	463.5172291882517
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
suggestion.	648.5026848187302
Both then were silent?	152.7652066269771
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	335.60385803568397
Were they indefinitely inactive?	561.1800171587117
At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen,
then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual
circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to
the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	694.8998959387256
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form
of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of
greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the
ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic
consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	561.4391194030492
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	437.59908431932877
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	1263.626669180939
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus
circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain
from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
excrescences as hair and toenails.	479.8553048000683
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	479.9845120953305
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the
Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	397.25550771575047
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
departer?	529.3847376539997
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	463.7942266513828
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	146.71415810543456
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	306.1897134370098
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of
their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	357.5599732467408
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the
bells in the church of Saint George.	126.77870580607585
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	225.3210987691119
By Stephen:
	203.15938669399281
Liliata rutilantium.	266.0083962612288
Turma circumdet.	317.52817152557833
Chorus excipiat.	365.4416887200119
By Bloom:
	203.15938669399281
Heigho, heigho,
	177.74094089514128
Heigho, heigho.	177.74094089514128
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
to Glasnevin in the north?	187.51519972375178
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in
bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),
John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in
bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	558.7996756055636
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	229.23917783284654
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,
the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.	313.4713146685861
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	236.2104237014258
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the
incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	628.1224319694843
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
him?	360.23486865511717
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	1142.8650885453649
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart
(phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,
Sandymount).	2516.55355300157
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	295.27669930854336
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
apparition of a new solar disk.	361.5891714191776
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	200.64530219612286
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of
the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
direction of Mizrach, the east.	266.08741078814376
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	375.80132258657505
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	476.9930109159131
Did he remain?	117.31383610070525
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
the passage, reclosing the door.	460.46303113681734
With brief suspiration he reassumed
the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front
room, hallfloor, and reentered.	395.231575748532
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	414.0989761521682
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	482.8273533065788
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	388.7734438552349
Describe them.	48.58276040143106
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing
discolouration.	557.2615612279653
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane
curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat
and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a
bright circle of white plaited rush.	519.6097724523462
What significances attached to these two chairs?	486.8093365567936
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of
circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	419.73219270760893
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	340.43797031284873
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_
(words by G.	564.2218743865775
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	563.2438875180283
Molloy, sung by Madam
Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
close.	988.8940831488287
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	701.9428728138653
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a
large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the
consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration.	565.2800933860616
His next proceeding?	404.3016449506438
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it
superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
facilitate total combustion.	384.7742105542252
What followed this operation?	350.16405097415833
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	1005.4332707923703
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece?	323.490334399631
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m.	396.76503312898393
on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
Alderman John Hooper.	817.5108919130997
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom?	436.6007918817144
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	257.7860547170518
Before the
mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	798.4161388714067
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention?	404.79124147882067
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	492.6076787632263
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	657.5131229752109
Brothers and sisters had he none.	143.61096910553434
Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.	125.49349634066448
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	905.7530815968178
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator.	619.1916195027127
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	291.72569566169136
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
on the two bookshelves opposite.	421.34090234238954

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
the inverted volumes?	344.13723511445147
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	293.8718915689598
Which volume was the largest in bulk?	247.65213164866285

The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).	706.5373207574908
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	240.0480184623185
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to
consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of
the military engagement, Plevna.	318.35231422722524
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?	317.45467958593713
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus
purchased by auction from P.	501.5895433798635
Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.	465.3318906701459
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?	324.8567499788385
Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.	485.4914602933518
How was the irritation allayed?	208.77226495361677
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table.	228.4636235326905
He
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,
shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black
hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over
the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the
medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in
circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the
summits of the mammary prominences.	516.8399371162159
He unbraced successively each of
six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one
incomplete.	651.9247992309532
What involuntary actions followed?	897.541610100218
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice
in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a
sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.	592.4299546649858
He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.	440.71740681697116

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and
salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking
repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded
the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his
two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right
sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again
effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic
sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right
foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently
lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part
lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then,
with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	353.03692135092854
Why with satisfaction?	125.68403284748766
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.	606.2536048032676

P., P.	203.15938669399281
C.,
K.	203.15938669399281
P., L.	203.15938669399281
(_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned
in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have
left Kingstown for England).	625.0354255861427
What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	245.13856787724905
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the
dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social
inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered
with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the
uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to
the crown.	575.8994161003599
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated
by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance
of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all
simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a
preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution),
the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law
merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in
contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass
and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by
desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all
perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of
domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic
connubiality.	490.39361979459096
Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.	252.14432975992628
To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his
father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the
Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting
Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of
Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in
1888.	384.60767696643194
To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile
friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he
had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
colonial (e.g.	556.3548374700745
Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of
Charles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin of
Species_.	559.7916365671535
In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J.	846.1190312249015
O’Brien and others,
the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of
Charles Stewart Parnell (M.	611.0618445537201
for Cork City), the programme of peace,
retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M.	593.8605900182657
for
Midlothian, N.	494.0867752080217
B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on
Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the
capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000
torchbearers, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches
in escort of the marquess of Ripon and (honest) John Morley.	505.92923281744373
How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?	219.8808019630972
As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised
Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of
£ 60 per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from giltedged
securities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of £ 1200
(estimate of price at 20 years’ purchase), of which 1/3 to be paid on
acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz.	663.4998582304765
£ 800 plus
2 1/2 % interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual
instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for
purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of
£ 64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the
lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale,
foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure
to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the
absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of

What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?	618.3633402283511

face, form and address had been favourably received during the course
of the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie
Powell), a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid,
Gertrude (Gerty, family name unknown).	475.4911557388641
What possibility suggested itself?	561.8157247977473
The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not
immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in
the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately
mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.	463.1860718538481

I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice
that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all
times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.	425.3324509785311
What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
2nd drawer?	468.8919926341158

Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their
(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,
Hungary.	541.6151435275117
An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex
spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual

Son Leopold_.	685.3505279331351

evoke?	405.18442194500926
Tomorrow will be a week that I received...	218.1486808446957
it is no use Leopold to be

all
for me is out...	71.86065346109461
be kind to Athos, Leopold...	311.3783090485676
my dear son...	169.29879955491273
of me...	42.61211313364847
An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the
face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.	454.3551134405013
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	391.4461171943723
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
beliefs and practices.	466.30708339936547
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male
infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	486.58548841814735
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	262.80327957709
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
other beliefs and practices now appeared.	452.55320917843574
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	371.2645961735493
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	639.6651372429311
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in
the various centres mentioned.	533.7463120738686
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
migrations in narrator and listener?	366.8028499231801
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence
of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	214.66136831664028
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
amnesia?	416.62957327745136
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	299.28289878679544
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
inclined plate.	411.45667486105805
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of
food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of
paper.	258.7137468411024
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	377.5250479287139
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
repletion.	1413.977515227142
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	744.4611204424676
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
possession of scrip.	340.34258031073443
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	548.4740700437771
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.	429.71455744958666
Mendicancy:
that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in
the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
perforated umbrella.	1101.4590291265026
Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal
Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but
respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight.	518.8795683865008
Nadir of
misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
pauper.	991.2597119779388
With which attendant indignities?	483.63002126513084
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the
simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
than nothing.	647.1476397716834
By what could such a situation be precluded?	257.03861808330714
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	339.4516502147975
Which preferably?	317.5334699131929
The latter, by the line of least resistance.	230.05263303303497
What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	952.9581835736979
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.	1199.9024322719815
The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.	706.9315616394722
The
necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of
arrest.	523.0472887202851
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	751.5102831767532
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
parties, which was impossible.	528.7537878961582
What considerations rendered departure desirable?	1015.945085689371
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in
special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and
hachures.	693.6293059979791
In Ireland?	203.15938669399281

intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior
produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the
rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the
line alpha delta of Ursa Maior.	404.2167281525803
On land, meridional, a bispherical

posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose
negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.	511.26271881307855

Above sum will
be paid for information leading to his discovery.	324.9371084555207
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
nonentity?	485.47712520237405
Assumed by any or known to none.	165.97215316919352
Everyman or Noman.	172.5226360342497

Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman.	197.8718602682122

immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.	344.23878609043624
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	591.157709147487
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	526.7400808982959

imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
the summons of recall.	519.5939210535935
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of
peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on
malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial
resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver
king.	505.13756712777706
What would render such return irrational?	573.3410451547579
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
time.	449.3861533972883
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	1080.7907024433778
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of
the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,
desired desire.	579.6605496513845
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
unoccupied bed?	452.13288602071026
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation
of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in
the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between
the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit
section).	507.29876930542764
What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of
accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?	1024.0683412737603
The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion
and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John):
the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes
(Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the
visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along
Bedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the
music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a
truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank
period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a
leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine
exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina
Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs
Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance
medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and
from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).	587.64730616561
What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?	467.5467707517571
The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.	598.6224061025227
What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering
multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily
apprehending, not comprehend?	1948.8655785764647
Who was M’Intosh?	308.7272655386487
What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the
extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?	899.1913301017611
Where was Moses when the candle went out?	176.63733742927613
What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,
silently, successively, enumerate?	871.3495892158364
A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.	737.154490633361
What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?	643.0082163909583
The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal
Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn.	499.16680522849
What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?	318.36098502433646
Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines
meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from
infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the
Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.	632.5168361066101
What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
perceived by him?	580.0291004955117
A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new
violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on
generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish
cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,
having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its
fore side in white lettering B.	699.9282046132962
(Brian Cooper Tweedy).	494.0867752080217
What impersonal objects were perceived?	746.5606294903731

cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat.	659.0788579023053
Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware
and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed
irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin,
soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night
article (on the floor, separate).	661.1953615610862
Bloom’s acts?	150.64028491276085
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
bed.	243.63555151243898
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
marriage, of sleep and of death.	360.1928596055686
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	507.8418218558269
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	424.72116104744504
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	159.2143872727805
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	292.7138949536355
What preceding series?	470.563773330699
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show,
Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of
Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an
unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman
John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a
bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	1134.5409319632272
(Blazes) Boylan and so
each and so on to no last term.	168.1935532712714
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
late occupant of the bed?	222.40205670954145
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
boaster).	593.2461913019984
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
proportion and commercial ability?	470.88181975213575
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
comprehension and apprehension.	441.83024881013233
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected?	673.6377654573396
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	1010.1934830825129
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse.	565.7170636399129
Because attraction between
agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion
of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
reentrance.	596.9728371737156
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	314.45457095065746
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial
prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current
expenses, net proceeds divided.	998.2009735887245
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the
planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	217.8571207960792
As less
reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and
animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,
misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,
contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,
trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion
from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence
with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,
wilful and premeditated murder.	1166.0367141029596
As not more abnormal than all other
parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,
resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and
its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,
indulged inclinations, significant disease.	811.2621182721471
As more than inevitable,
irreparable.	509.4214074716735
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	819.6354881766961
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated.	593.7516887691139
What retribution, if any?	306.0409057976216
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	236.63923049405506
Duel by
combat, no.	193.57857168376364
Divorce, not now.	75.15663522031231
Exposure by mechanical artifice
(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),
not yet.	999.3220693876793
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault
with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	542.2797192344281
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	396.65206826480846
If any, positively, connivance,
introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of
publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,
alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from
the other, protecting the separator from both.	786.3274052685197
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	319.1234633898301
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest
or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of
nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	528.6872834131594
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	665.0363448832933
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	445.1298288486305
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	424.111837863167
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	827.6470133651442
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	907.7290830294339
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	424.111837863167
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	786.0409360064415
What followed this silent action?	352.0271666802731
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
catechetical interrogation.	2435.149862422818
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?	307.63010646954314
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in
the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and
response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
surname unknown.	503.1462973763753
Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs
Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South
King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36
and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical
tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of
fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement
in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since
completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,
eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an
aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a
witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of
decision and gymnastic flexibility.	595.3540713819085
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	513.7491649827081
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	317.31783247731784
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.	285.7126245675643
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	501.24748722216873
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz.	609.126047411569
8 October, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz.	569.4735929250089
27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without
ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	621.6935475240639
By the narrator a
limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete
mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place
since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,
of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there
remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of
a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed.	476.3052595753708
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
projected or effected.	340.362199054133
What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible
thoughts?	281.47052131027004
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.	415.8368203906365
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?	356.9112409693329
Listener, S.	203.15938669399281
by E.: Narrator, N.	770.5244035147354
by W.: on the 53rd parallel of
latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to
the terrestrial equator.	479.9143466301444
In what state of rest or motion?	215.57256368595708
In motion being
each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by
the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
neverchanging space.	492.7533028024165
In what posture?	199.6264529235337
Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed.	522.0974935492002
Narrator:
reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,
in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,
the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.	297.3500913035525
He rests.	287.40150812754337
He has travelled.	263.84462760927033
Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and
Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and
Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and
Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.	255.9412316215712
Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc’s
auk’s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of
Darkinbad the Brightdayler.	195.42439451938773
Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when
he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was
actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all
her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and
earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God
help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and
lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was
pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like
her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a
welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here
and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her
dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats
especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that
and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always
if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much
better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I
suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have
a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till
they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as
much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre
sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was
O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day
I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones
she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into
a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying
on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more
like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same
besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor
paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I
was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it
not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by
his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her
so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was
really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it
planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember
Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he
not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and
turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what
harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to
him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever
met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle
in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in
with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as
I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a
letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the
paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the
blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably
that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all
men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is
now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old
fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I
care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though
Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my
nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell
of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by
getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat
without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was
drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of
course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table
on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing
my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if
you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on
with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you
have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters
but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be
alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a
little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave
her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do
out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out
the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I
couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar
and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the
place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because
he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere
and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan
gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there
steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb
to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he
has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out
and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the
satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be
always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking
boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id
confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my
garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I
know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging
drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this
that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would
because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in
the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a
stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and
he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he
is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it
tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine
Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what
he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply
ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it
till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your
lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the
world about it people make its only the first time after that its just
the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man
without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when
you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish
some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in
his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul
almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to
Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and
I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my
child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where
you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done
with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put
it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he
want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat
hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he
Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in
the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never
turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost
for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them
Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense
off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre
married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the
pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt
like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though
I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of
his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it
who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they
stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking
green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with
the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American
that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do
to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took
the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt
lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I
popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful
to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when
I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it
brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to
church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only
grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I
lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that
tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or
whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is
not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my
hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a
thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think
a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life
felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must
have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with
a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into
you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious
look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a
tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on
me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt
washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice
invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if
someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went
through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina
Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up
with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a
smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like
a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the
last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and
bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied
till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what
supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was
married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has
more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting
Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him
off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I
know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing
and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming
and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not
liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over
politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive
about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for
I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he
annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot
of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often
wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family
physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with
her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever
he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me
the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that
finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I
know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out
to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know
plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch
him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them
all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of
course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him
that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love
him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might
imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of
a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it
out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and
wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the
night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I
want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper
with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too
much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know
more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie
whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I
said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash
possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick
when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the
indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was
too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment
she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk
about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes
he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him
just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might
murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes
mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when
he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he
always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and
now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard
U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff
to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than
marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like
me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and
he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick
that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man
yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and
do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating
drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask
us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because
they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off
flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say
its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have
been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being
hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do
besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they

theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it
was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed
breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting
all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long
one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got
after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish
times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to
Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the
turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea
2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him
because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he
meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that
if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill
stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still
I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of
a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to
mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my
stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another
time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I
could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world
that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and
beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because
the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in
the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere
I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell
DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on
the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting
for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown
part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was
always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his
mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a
place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him
about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there
and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it
or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an
idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got
me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me
to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming
along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had
to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape
of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me
when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject
of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced
things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels
even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one
in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see
every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain
I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the
Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the
Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking
slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they
can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on
it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were
you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me
his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it
was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he
pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he
said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an
excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time
till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his
waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in
the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them
and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the
sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet
if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you
never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it
if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers
outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him
from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do
everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting
all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the
butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to
any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we
met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw
I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was
always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky
man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake
dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it
used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in
Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the
same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you
think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the
door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after
dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me
professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in
his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out
you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I
thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches
first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was
trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he
must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2
Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch
he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after
when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty
when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even
put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week
were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers
anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms
at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new
bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next
room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the
wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all
very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we
never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes
going where he is besides something always happens with him the time
going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for
the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with
the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and
the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion
for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two
gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was
too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a
good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd
have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him
O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I
wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the
train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots
of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly
be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone
in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something
about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the
window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what
would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last
concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall
Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen
Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my
singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts
when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him
managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to
sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead
Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out
he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some
old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein
lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and
nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very
intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats
all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I
hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and
Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd
East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and
just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was
lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty
he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the
road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could
have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of
the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of
dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their
fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love
to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish
cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from
Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham
battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the
march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O
the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made
his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me
a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen
up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like
I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going
round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the
knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or
tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go
and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money
and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I
could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when
I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the
expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with
his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat
always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from
behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the
dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so
quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the
way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish
tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly
welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he
was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the
stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20
quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for
me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that
sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming
back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor
looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first
noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I
wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my
fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for
I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers
were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have
slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always
hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down
your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a
great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case
if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one
thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I
think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them
either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she
didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of
silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought
them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one
change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into
him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id
want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips
he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a
delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance
across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill
have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it
the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his
money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a
cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret
that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die
of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that
antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the
fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats
all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was
the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like
new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place
and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to
him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to
wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax
and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the
skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger
after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry
handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world
without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it
around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea
into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues
itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all
the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners
3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the
other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because
they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every
day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all
Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith
shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys
on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down
to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham
street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it
as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the
day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of
Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads
only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black
mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny
story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster
knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and
the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing
like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master
Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her
ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and
her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that
pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody
can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that
twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs
him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a
woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out
of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the
crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have
a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of
her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and
she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar
the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted
the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me
too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to
chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it
and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank
where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day
of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with
him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe
like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching
about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still
only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could
have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada
once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly
Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I
lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming
into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no
good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as
I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot
of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I
went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes
take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in
Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as
insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were
giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of
her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second
time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see
him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for
me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs
Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him
being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled
I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely
sorry and Im sure you were
	291.19258115625234
yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one
anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep
that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out
for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2
the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up
there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide
it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a
man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down
out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it
with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat
market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the
statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was
pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one
side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved
them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed
outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to
try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7
wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night
coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade
to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting
cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was
a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see
me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it
before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not
afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the
woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for
a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the
job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee
palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes
only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish
photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her
and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent
they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly
enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a
pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly
caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till
he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get
him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker
than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond
everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only
could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it
the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an
hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant
I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those
men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch
myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come
again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when
he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was
coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him
after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or
anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain
who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man
theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice
about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my
eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue
between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday
two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday

frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those
engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and
out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor
men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in
those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half
of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying
about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W
C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there
for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres
last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the
hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and
refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get
like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on
black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big
giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with
the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and
the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time
weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs
Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest
Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name
was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a
jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she
called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing
Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he
bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing
things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you
will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious
currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina
be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also
Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit
married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was
awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to
step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was
given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them
expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic
all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or
jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious
old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2
things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the
women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole
insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all
my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking
in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose
theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes
you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to
myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker
than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up
and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we
were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in
her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning
with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an
opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father
and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the
windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like
all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at
myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the
shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been
nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me
the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East
Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by
that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as
he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave
me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a
Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a
whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards
of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one
decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and
his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my
shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the
chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on
the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them
at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago
it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her
address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were
always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and
the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those
Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything
he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was
blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I
did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a
Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage
made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it
got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run
away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or
aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me
waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and
booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing
everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when
general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great
fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there
from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the
son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums
rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with
messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their
jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men
to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the
gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about
Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum
lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil
with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his
nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner
but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room
on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky
talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along
I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a
letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with
bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails
listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an
instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your
hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me
looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the
opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I
put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a
notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even
youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake
hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half
frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great
intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in
their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms
intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they
were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to
swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of
paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a
poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some
advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam
only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a
letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what
possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the
recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say
she was married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear
with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was
near seventy always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie
theres the piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too
on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that
have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles
that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt
know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor
Nancy its a bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things
and no stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement
symph̸athy I always make that mistake and new̸phew with 2 double yous
in I hope hell write me a longer letter the next time if its a thing he
really likes me O thanks be to the great God I got somebody to give me
what I badly wanted to put some heart up into me youve no chances at
all in this place like you used long ago I wish somebody would write me
a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked
yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff silly women believe love is
sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth
in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something
to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world I
could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few
words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used to write to the
fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out
of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he
could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with
equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans
proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very
fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might
as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit.	319.42716164131417
Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her
in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles
with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough
in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there
was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black
blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on
Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell
bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an
admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him
up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window
then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making
an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it
up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill
instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps
singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the
old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under
the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what
kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was
sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way
what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish
nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to
be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in
jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about
myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I
suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all
the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and
the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the
black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it
was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in
the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the
rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all
about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail
careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was
a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and
throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that
white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could
without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was
tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be
the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those
frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever
they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots
Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when
they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing
yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever
he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I
was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness
out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last
day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he
wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was
awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me
with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop
even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was
afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once
took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered
with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of
youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with
you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling
there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I
pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I
opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I
had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first
tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt
awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the
same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got
over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back
the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the
middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was
his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was
rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the
whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed
come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed
do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now
flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20
years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put
his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young
still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has
she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever
dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you
might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I
was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in
from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and
pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle
hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to
read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he
hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he
always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso
swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long
preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle
and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and
me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that
would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it
looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M
Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well
its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with
bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I
wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my
mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows
after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along
Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other
side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like
Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down
at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars
pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was
to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world
and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while
they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up
Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that
was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from
on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral
necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay
of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits
like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the
sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at
the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow
for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that
Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on
you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me
that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south
Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they
were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it
like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold
because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that
the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to
the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that
was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if
that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the
heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in
the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill
my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all
night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see
why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter
its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was
only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes
dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those
mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with
the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing
about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite
used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the
summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then
stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the
chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us
goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get
in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again
coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the
manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night
squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink
water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon
haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like
the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down
in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling
up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then
play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has
she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate
their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like
that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I
wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think
Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with
some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb
pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and
Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes
Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting
anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin
chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck
the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or
let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and
drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him
examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters
no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed
sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks
there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday
anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit
Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the
seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after
him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked
could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it
came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all
down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the
tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping
out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of
course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his
flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all
the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was
black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was
no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that
book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other
Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with
his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white
shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather
all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell
of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan
bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the
fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa
and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to
climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago
besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at
night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of
salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was
going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or
Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the
way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he
was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely
places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the
gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of
and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was
going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry
my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the
plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old
beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and
put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of
that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in
jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine
his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles
away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows
to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a
madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute
like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed
Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better
than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and
he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was
looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits
making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit
there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling
especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl
down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather
instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not
like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the
same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way
he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the
place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming
in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as
I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then
doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to
look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack
statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got
that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2
shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right
not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at
the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to
understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant
say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and
helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its
me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on
the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now
shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me
whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly
come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her
round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well
he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to
go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I
smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I
sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I
tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a
parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out
no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your
blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle
blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on
show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at
her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you
then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me
afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that
touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always
trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for
Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed
like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me
there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to
get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same
little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but
he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the
Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands
swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything
deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into
the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that
Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with
sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he
looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and
supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man
gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it
really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love
in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each
other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit
foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and
poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes
always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to
put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time
enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes
pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too
but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a
fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we
met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to
see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough
till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that
now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me
that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because
how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night
before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to
leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as
she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was
the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself
they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the
two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever
going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming
Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that
old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the
things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course
shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly
dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something
and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends
to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you
please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father
such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the
cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at
the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won
them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody
saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand
funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody
hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head
I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been
hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the
ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was
something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and
now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband
getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they
have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats
her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres
some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead
in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if
Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt
that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he
had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that
pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows
theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual
monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like
that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him
to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about
insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt
give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his
glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul
thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could
all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it
out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry
supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery
hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a
woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up
for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is
better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience
above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me
pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just
put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn
it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a
virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you
could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do
or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this
pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what
between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too
jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the
other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor
with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think
it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I
might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next
time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face
wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me
after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I
made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse
and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be
he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits
easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling
like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for
a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning
dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look
how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit
here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get
up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey
lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore

who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when
was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to
the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that
white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick
Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called
it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting
round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every
little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of
course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last
man in the world besides theres something queer about their children
always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what
I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one
thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly
old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and
could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the
rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by
the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I
can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and
needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by
Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the
same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and
asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all
the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked
sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows
what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out
frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you
lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever
enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad
crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious
Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and
of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he
had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I
hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him
up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited
me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in
Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes
as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking
after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half
sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand
for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his
blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool
of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O
beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and
rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy
anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st
opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom
pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk
and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight
sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so
that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose
there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at
the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard
bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth
breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to
show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a
pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out
that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put
together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody
I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big
square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway
wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt
creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere
still she must have given him great value for his money of course he
has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll
have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God
help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always
reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often
enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to
admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like
my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses
were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard
street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on
the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the
men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse
and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always
somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always
know who was in there last every time were just getting on right
something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr
Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old
lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives
impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along
in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres
Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well
thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody
climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that
little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if
he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I
dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their
lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont
believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats
Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in
real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is
disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads
and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about
with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow
poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both
sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let
him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the
one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews
used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast
or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough
for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his
own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that
wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and
lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder
was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too
no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants
me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that
forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some
little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the
College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his
nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at
those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no
use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr
Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in
the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd
be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind
in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that
bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or
other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys
husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye
trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old
green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way
like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call
that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with
their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping
that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be
sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still
though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of
them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches
if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well
when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to
squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after
his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im
sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do
unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some
pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come
home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully
becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at
the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he
borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and
squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a
wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough
that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the
preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and
Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the
second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly
sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying
too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had
a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart
_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_
goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in
it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we
sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even
transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed
say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I
wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a
university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he
driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have
got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look
young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and
me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge
station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago
now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for
what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for
me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted
hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time
he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord
Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw
him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God
yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out
the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met
before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either
besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after
that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on
its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise
in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look
at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about
poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only
getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry
when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not
an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I
wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose
hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not
that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of
course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was
out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not
a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson
they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont
find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back
there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that
for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly
bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young
star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to
talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts
ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in
their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like
to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young
those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace
from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or
something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men
like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely
little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and
his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and
poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his
lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth
if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and
white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if
some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no
danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I
suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the
most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age
Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard
comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out
Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew
who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the
same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him
till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and
mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he
becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though
	319.59813475690373
no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because
I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a
cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so
barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a
butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course
hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its
because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he
couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the
amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white
for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with
that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so
soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those
cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has
a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it
didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts
his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be
you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick
and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl
for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street
no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me
up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands
jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling
her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if
he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he
going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course
the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either
its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all
those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can
I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with
him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the
wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a
womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything
unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of
us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the
dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita
theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a
madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young
no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the
fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking
would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd
know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not
care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of
those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near
the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only
sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back
over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow
with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me
up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do
themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us
the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course
it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and
when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after
coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his
wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten
again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the
love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well
he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he
knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to
sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for
Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around
down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like
to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I
dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be
governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one
another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around
drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on
horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop
sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know
what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they
all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I
never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away
from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the
usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a
fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to
make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two
dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in
that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some
poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it
was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into
the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I
felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of
roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and
pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining
himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to
love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends
they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some
woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder
they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I
suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like
that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I
suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the
next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I
wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had
the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave
me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and
Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown
myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the
bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and
Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am
a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day
older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish
como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all
I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person
place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs
Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the
two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the
Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant
what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and
wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in
bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad
luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and
something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might
like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the
criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you
see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself
not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend
we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is
dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head
sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres
the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his
writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he
does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes
making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to
take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house
like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated
person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with
the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown
that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long
ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill
get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I
might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and
tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in
lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out
looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the
night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt
in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw
him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his
mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do
Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa
pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son
piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good
eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if
thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked
too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the
mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it
out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly
unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell
him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right
its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery
said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of
tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I
suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt
have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to
kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his
face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes
there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill
tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he
wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women
do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write
his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it
up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided
he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill
do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes
like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill
tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick
my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest
about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and
friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing
pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of
plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better
itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there
thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me
just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up
at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only
way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just
getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well
soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil
their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the
alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself
let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those
they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much
nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it
twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill
go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some
flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow
today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place
up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can
have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the
keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or
those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7
1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky
sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the
table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I
love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of
heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and
the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats
and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about
that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all
sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the
ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no
God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or
whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves
first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why
because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes
I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there
was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so
there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising
tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the
rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat
the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of
seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago
my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a
flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that
was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today
yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a
woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the
pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I
wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was
thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and
Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all
birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the
pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing
round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls
laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the
morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who
else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market
all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half
asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the
steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle
thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and
turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop
and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice
hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night
and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the
watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown
torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the
glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all
the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and
the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and
Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put
the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a
red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well
as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again
yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could
feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and
yes I said yes I will Yes.	307.55103368311677
