n, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	190.37545547194225

My dear, dear
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"
	338.22500665667627
While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	346.3036896712032
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.	166.78234991349694

then said,

From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.	212.85106677555166

cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its

She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	177.32277544611833

Bingley

accept the honour of their invitation, &c.	137.20423710121068
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr.	280.171391037914
went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	84.13218338181183
necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I

My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	168.49090386503232
CHAPTER X.	227.5647962113789
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	178.04839657375913
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	147.55796291287976
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	335.9388602471139
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.	223.55705578241464
But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you.	176.9274555869973
As they drove to Mr.	179.11414580735462
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	186.85053259703582
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	148.2935559255803
She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	149.75673945540416
In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	131.92107742165348
She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	159.12755125262373
Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs.	191.09344595945754
At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,
	218.38748551533632
her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
	270.5518964117592
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	204.92996537212395
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	260.5349147876888
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.	275.20616747401874
"Are you, indeed?	71.48262187729317
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	349.67086444445897
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
	145.69499102879448
Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	173.3963632723636
But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.	200.55340127438325
"I beg your pardon.	217.4038902925088
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	163.90619154099906
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	126.20757378398365
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr.	215.16520189783088
Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	406.2018005956329
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	207.5622874031673
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	407.30797772521305
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	213.00834542651262
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	128.42035452880776
"DEAR SIR,
	227.5647962113789
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	123.71024133700205
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	147.34622809280603
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.	191.48176709987942
Darcy's proposals.	137.750397889271
Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.	410.12447885834695
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	170.58372545826205
Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	189.35629461369928
She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	143.5718198928713
Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	213.914132410809
For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	158.4497837307622
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	207.66980772758268
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	169.54832729785588
Darcy looked
up.	131.70247977447093
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	231.19562210973027
She declared her resolution.	169.61537386695915
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	159.64956587022755
Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.	164.7959491931034
They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	172.0523055373752
And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false."
	262.9859424494314
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	222.79985274732056
towards Mr.	227.5647962113789
he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	184.3273576074097
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	198.841254134228
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	154.98582577235933
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	199.67559743405732
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr.	230.11640368789543
A Novel.	227.5647962113789
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
	151.14323258816506
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	320.9151340174469
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
	189.40952251378778
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	212.76217131797114
A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me.	378.28026942136876
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr.	153.80357001741322
Bennet
came from it.	79.40550663318223
If I have wounded your sister's
	222.13213512878158
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	174.35538136420186
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	154.3087689950146
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	220.90894318638618
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	207.1839424289947
He must go
	97.28826094604749
desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
	178.02111107454306
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	174.27166975885785
Darcy can please where he chuses.	223.16079260516386
I must confess myself
	177.84505473126893
long from my poor mother.	124.0906956414748
CHAPTER XXII.	227.5647962113789
discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
	118.0837569146092
This was not very consoling to Mrs.	139.3494895999476
I knew that Mr.	193.70319624625694
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	230.4978437334025
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.	230.565666926618
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
	403.8522438931427
of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
	194.3942214010378
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr.	220.8911030631245

"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
	182.69197532807382
I had not an idea of it."
	67.47793290140207
But, my
	40.291684577058874
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.	140.08854844539204
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
impossible.	162.15507226543858
She was teazed by
Mr.	244.10431057112217
"Yes, very handsome."
	111.34664739139619
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	151.98974959161038
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	224.3242816850106
"And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	219.33005553111846
"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	79.47462599258431
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	136.97000727611356
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	129.21926792542988
I was
	28.815781734504046
Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	219.53184576670685
As long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	118.59760119158152
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	261.9465105022816
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	185.2926484592603
She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	175.8431360311388
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	138.7155341951539
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	158.63633020159608
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.	163.91948276856797
Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	258.72913278962966
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	178.31859772302835
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	149.08333106491645
He has given in all his debts; I hope
	198.35554757731876
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	214.18728332109316
I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
	159.84956756850323
Oh!
why is not every body as happy?"
	124.05423545901694
You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	255.8203139583608
Collins and Lizzy.	114.8481004092976
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."
	191.40860245921175
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."
	232.7895093890598
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart.	208.4219507378625
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	237.0938256856504
Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	315.493783519822
and be careful to write explicitly.	225.3311246515166
As she pronounced these words, Mr.	329.2569678194182
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	149.23080827881736
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	175.6718486834304
1.D.	227.5647962113789
is she handsome?"
	84.20747119378653
Darcy half as well as I do my dear
	147.59915081025133
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	169.96032352628183
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	216.66973138282208
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	212.46412861181068
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	140.18827410007225
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr.	116.18628793847013
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day."
	169.0677261945573
witness of undoubted veracity.	273.7912105742783
That his two sisters and Mr.	146.82984809855162
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again.	183.5267882636155
The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	307.1609305005502
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts."

CHAPTER V.	227.5647962113789
But however he did not.	75.71417456223215
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	157.0504722289605
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	160.55820559682925
"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	196.89292102669177
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."
	124.49175225525163
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.	105.22026778100191
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr.	159.6138858828282
How are you all?"
	60.95122040377487
He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	304.909382619067
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	272.93292262183604
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	293.03063730495387
actually married, you cannot greatly err.	279.05851421594076
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	218.53698519758743
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	160.14715583450462
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	178.46150420754643
If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient.	268.338166462417
I know not what to think.	68.08964649382041
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."
	168.12276444470183
ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
	167.9772053629303
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	165.02449893600155
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	173.59229887455476
"Has she been presented?	126.12849177731074
He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr.	201.40480050786235
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."
	150.44680461027795
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	147.80533932043076
"A gamester!" she cried.	225.48193023652473
You need not.	101.86557087455388
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	162.49102613782506
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
	208.53368074562758
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.	177.35204140173767
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	160.22183456718523
Their visits to Mrs.	249.4267346047404
not comprise what I have to tell you.	177.35893387583454
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
	157.69689962065772
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	109.14898779287827
The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	178.0964509870233
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"
	259.38972692501244
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	177.58753008259308
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	209.40674664813676
You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	142.32883431277335
But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	213.3895401577823
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property.	128.7387472283633
CHAPTER XXI.	227.5647962113789
Collins and me have a little conversation together."
	99.1211282250649
Their manners are not equal to his."
	98.1795630001412
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."
	214.4041232031961
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	140.1481450046756
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr.	137.70684910707055
Section 4.	227.5647962113789
He is come--Mr.	194.74860543848786
Must it be so?"
	48.468565593273404
At length, she spoke again.	153.1075065904923
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
	106.5462640935302
1.F.1.	532.9036398671572
Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	227.5963969913622
trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
	105.43446107126533
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."
	148.76672782296268
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	265.9640370207202
London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	224.19673639236294
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	223.39828905264133
It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	168.21008802528868
the kingdom.	181.03429675024012
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	198.47422925664324
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	124.60129779280729
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	174.12872306609333
Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	191.8950642550148
He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	193.7661880908729
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.	296.7320187118872
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	156.31270093867252
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	166.27044011404865
Lydia came to
	56.12801374560331
Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr.	167.09692345074978
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr.	229.439985949565
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.	289.3374217584601
To Kitty, however, it does not
	156.9209739995517
a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
	260.8718434971331
1.E.1.	532.9036398671572
At present I will
say nothing about it."
	201.4677776617418
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	176.27373813577657
myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
	175.7920638293707
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	112.35598495897462
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."
	117.49596289853588
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	94.79179225294087
Wickham, you must be very happy.	83.26852517491697
Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	177.4250825803159
"You cannot be too much on your guard.	146.05571281088456
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	132.620237992734
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?"
	105.26489071446771
before she leaves the South.	181.55960493174925
Does he
know his real character?"
	124.59634552051024
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
	401.81710921782275
It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	156.36559889380817
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	169.24862861918226
Jenkinson's room.	75.56095738522781
family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
	124.8950342782541
Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	116.2879660650625
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	171.191157424617
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	145.64411679506222
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.	267.22015024082424
There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."
	317.8606492576369
Darcy--that Mr.	139.75390650600812
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	192.5582912112731
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	274.44732973494484
A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."
	219.37225107329752
far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	210.82412175558377
It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	155.77681549162563
Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.	225.25087531469757
But Mr.	227.5647962113789
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.	153.1744737142343
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	210.19066225532
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	194.20318676974887
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	135.0482105304634
Section 3.	227.5647962113789
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	213.68554007375948
I quite detest the man."
	165.43878893656728
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	140.12526182566768
aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
	182.40418152045663
I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	203.426644641927
Who should suffer but myself?	160.65582049297856
My fingers wait your orders."
	441.4706712010043
"You are then resolved to have him?"
	96.66275072412755
Wickham is the son of a very
	60.780500571897534
Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	224.2056420625533
Your's, &c.	118.48549454437234
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	208.46517304984624
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,
	279.1638531129851
Things are settled so
oddly."
	223.41201560976958
easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	227.6871385076841
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	181.24492414913942
The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	324.2552703800504
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."
	168.1185148812812
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	266.7879184073017
far, as to exclude me from P.	172.02482016396777
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,
	218.2865086042736
"Yet why did he come?"
	128.7186510226255
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	210.1893912713679
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.	174.60138964343375
Your's, &c."
	118.48549454437234
Will you come and see me?"
	83.38048807973067
You need not send them word at
	176.81509747617056
Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	169.36884064668988
Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	182.2751534537587
His doing so
drew her notice.	196.02640409435952
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	150.18315134010265
for he must know my father can give her nothing.	113.78868769011792
"That will do extremely well, child.	217.6658100944509
Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	187.55456953310076
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.	115.67527817238658
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."
	237.46555890915386
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."
	141.91450938407027
"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	339.79233147933525
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	206.60545692576096
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.	579.335123757415
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.	201.34675402911174
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."
	156.07662715401426
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.	150.700364618422
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine.	201.43020857335833
Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	141.38789810367226
Why does she not come in?"
	81.88453945822715
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	142.60906669245438
But does not Jane
correspond with the sister?	205.88195703597344
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
	201.63281289200805
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."
	140.6330064519663
I know no harm of her."
	96.04596731001033
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	186.13356731100433
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	187.37547088889778
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	115.81689503262515
Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	204.7683976940336
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."
	164.91280574877462
Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.	192.1910176831649
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	98.11882560375565
You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr.	138.1194009373746
He
drew a chair near her.	187.80600222382932
She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	218.5738662557312
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	216.2167984454821
Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	162.2499162970791
He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	176.03689361156708
Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	179.41112548679496
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard.	235.5457671662976
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	382.9047184196419
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.	206.31496822311024
At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest

defect of his character after all.	76.97705623330992
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit.	208.07923600266494
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	166.2610632262897
She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	157.88496549415916
"What does Mr.	273.98523541069204
reason for his resolving to follow us.	139.38977468783312
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	134.8228483334321
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	134.82791409108944
"My dear, you flatter me.	137.94490902548063
Elizabeth will

"What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
fashion."
	188.69949903561906
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr.	194.29344982100434
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves.	381.9287450818136
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.	195.23915509432624
It will not do.	64.66205238234697
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	219.6618258068054
As the day of his arrival drew near,
	124.85106988816385
Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	139.69405319531185
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr.	245.17219017354725
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	142.93910270090566
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	150.78759035506783
We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	197.94812130897336
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	185.1907274781535
I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals."
	268.6023604891639
Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	441.7580120573437
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	160.18864548547853
This information, however, startled Mrs.	503.9488972158743
you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
	366.55774696720977
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."
	286.63957604426906
At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.	215.50672717164232
Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	136.820490507985

Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to

evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	169.11388652812772

At night she opened her heart to Jane.	176.5605006395847
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character

The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	208.5000205038054
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?	243.07247913996142
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."

It was a subject, in short, on

But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money

Collins; "but if she

naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	179.35189118738123

Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."
	112.36614272525048
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	160.23199345699223
His diffidence had

Darcy asked him why he had not married your
	120.95605270040237
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?	218.7609029428875
She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	155.70466818325255
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	222.26205176669046
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."
	311.08664961856675
Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	151.8460454497016
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."
	130.2312819804046
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	199.18971004118623
Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	183.8839352357974
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,
	116.9832557693238
to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
	295.7350372756893
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	215.64631953654066
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	236.25811908522542
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr.	256.9090151715417
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

_family_ owe me nothing.	296.5370096569893
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	128.41888794844465
I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."
	189.54955133369094
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."
	176.36923348100262
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	216.46674227737861
On finding
Mrs.	422.8068598414599
He confessed himself
	258.5580305647778
Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	155.38183388892963
"No governess! How was that possible?	225.7696251471172
There is a lady, it seems, a
	80.14023293941676
One seems so forlorn without them."
	242.1099856467924
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	210.99422329809173
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	185.3148887714693
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."
	219.36720004932062
When first Mr.	241.79420960167985
She has two nieces
of her own.	116.27132611487838
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	168.790025103962
_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.	209.64685149588288
Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.	190.46935471879078
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	189.34000860806685
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	246.79606340355468
"No, my dear; I think not.	143.77493373765319
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	288.92640745630325
This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	149.450069190077
Why was he to be the judge?"
	56.91238425376668
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."
	187.73611490926314
He generously imputed the whole to his
	156.78599201754065
yourself and Mrs.	114.7805613912024
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."
	201.94368697801252
resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
	398.0352588483855
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	121.8146877351634
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	221.0695139472753
marks nothing bad at heart.	188.14194538604042
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.	250.23562156330692
Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."
	154.94366716009685
The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	256.8426274940054
sister's indifference.	116.73843407066282
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	266.85827147305605
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
	217.31981030153233
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
	191.6754759859107
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	372.25426888325956
A clear ten
thousand per annum.	662.9500992356586
Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	207.69933447599527
to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	121.78223155014342
The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr.	162.484662499141
"Then, who taught you?	133.08027540056008
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	140.79371020858778
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	194.86230388755266
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way.	202.78157501755817
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose?	254.21133771281507
_He_ was
	28.815781734504046
In as short a time as Mr.	142.34221232585125
The dejection was almost
universal.	331.9230205725192
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	148.5150149590886
What will you think of my vanity?	92.73899268516895
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	178.9009459044661
If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
	216.3632844175508
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	146.3257478287454
_He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."
	193.18475732323967
In Three Volumes.	532.9036398671572
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	152.69353654719984
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."
	228.03011100003954
CHAPTER X.	227.5647962113789
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	163.81576177456213
Wickham of course wanted more
	123.11451007279562
It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	187.93194108343076
"This account then is what he has received from Mr.	181.32984416024357
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	517.8089680845166
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	521.0230427570975
But if you are really innocent and
	126.03245701834258
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	109.99108419776941
The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	189.37725515577472
"Something very much to the purpose of course.	80.70167623931692
I
did not expect such a compliment."
	119.5477358488155
"Ah! sir, I do indeed.	257.7830036750084
Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	271.54597567081635
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	326.1968376979468
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"
	386.33715608943066
to whom I have related the affair.	229.2897264263166
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror.	252.0069175040534
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	260.34238210604656
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	177.9027040327017
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	165.79460870933178
"So much the better.	68.78695732562001
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"
	117.00290055996462
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	200.47025515494806
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."
	165.49370212842246
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	160.94621671309153
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
	222.50710813208033
Collins

He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	115.72481514025499
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	306.68414324459724
Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:
	178.0798340490538
"Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief.	330.4802959353538
and Mrs.	227.5647962113789
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."
	102.03069472865405
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."
	160.2183349713204
"Yes; to the last.	41.25491009765227
"So much the better.	68.78695732562001

Forster say?	370.5544859147118

In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,
	161.92626630460182
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with
	133.9845837977197
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	167.75232250035924

"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.	160.58694308462788
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	238.67032459476715
The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	189.83692995944438
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."

It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	161.80455254337272
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	187.85588675956743
Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	251.12290326308334

DEAR SIR,

was eclipsed by Mr.	121.94142733519914
"Not so hasty, if you please.	175.81403379464254

quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	261.0193659803495

"Yes, or I will never see her again."

Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	216.9576374163641
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	185.48334320256865
"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"
	220.2404502727331
Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr.	225.75324826272
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
	206.92364419526015
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	180.64856797078144
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	205.79638475130784
Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	160.28252883142198
it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant

Pray forgive
	176.11955856730572
Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	159.14930391791367
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	212.3305119263693

head, as you will hear."

"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	132.47496793810083
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned.	210.3563427160068
Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	185.04587410359753
"To-morrow fortnight."
	262.55754243296525
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	254.72795337553407
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs.	174.6238452267563
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	166.41006991229293
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	112.30093728577612
She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	213.86116825457495
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham.	203.42203388086864
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	190.5102611197621
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	153.61196770399428

They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	147.01345305808658
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	317.4049431664483

never saw in the whole course of my life."
	132.90456846519467
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."

Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned

	172.79747083304616
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	190.3801006853834
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs.	259.12292997146494
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	219.93061963008157
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr.	151.74011058691985
She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	158.3513790838876
It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	94.36143213675827
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	198.35779044639708
I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	282.5967234885624
"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	226.15443527198485
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	185.16705057153607
but I cannot think so ill of him.	154.02295505034962
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	213.63141937974066
A thousand things may arise in six months!"

Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	171.1999632958685
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	208.58161589704537
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr.	142.2339356438615
Tell him I hope he will
	147.48668108227022
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	204.89109148313898
You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	125.12073950998182
Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
ill."
	270.1938133505036
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	166.1893843267343
It is nearly fifty miles."
	343.01609232861216
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.	288.9709739833282
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	171.67977490233486
Bennet could hardly
contain herself.	201.1181517343469
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	245.4148191928114
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.	161.52716482035484
Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	255.7835261626111
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr.	191.87352514267278
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	192.31157099392135
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."
	97.31112394678117
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now.	192.1467915558801
What
could be more natural than his asking you again?	136.8588553306526
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	261.4409359932903
We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	130.37285284179436
The visit
was returned in due form.	210.12412782283778
There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	159.75672568989305
Bingley arrived.	153.03085629703094
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	169.6942181827948
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	144.8205120644777

Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs.	198.38477102809594
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	389.28214131642727
"One of them does."
	69.27453216700619
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	181.22746217209945
Darcy by
character perfectly well.	155.26426136942754
"But what is to be
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.	187.2257611145907
"_That_ you certainly shall."
	101.82640841945263
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	170.37613684320723
He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."
	199.0030495882237
By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	249.19488629800054
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	123.38235268532804
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	222.29754805932896
Collins, I think.	221.9794466507381

Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	193.99075325895706
But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	175.62898302898378
Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	172.3079529080697
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	106.38562367568909
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.	122.44278931707034

When you told Mrs.	190.1939838884299
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	199.59235221992228
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	313.3525481663871
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	153.3510115822316
CHAPTER VI.	227.5647962113789
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	211.0160773773028
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	132.69920691047287
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	309.1217355678891
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	199.25177900142705
before, not many hours after the express.	136.93236990959826
His

Do not be

"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	285.44042021825646
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	140.57535314360175
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	181.07617305365392
He
cannot afford it.	155.49028995350469
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."
	149.41492494164297
She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	221.53300658893676
all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
	133.6983345151714
James's.	40.77723074686394
And this consideration leads me moreover to
	230.49915681657208
With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs.	356.22979069250556
But Georgiana would not join
her.	155.55670630421503
They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
	123.27158424915922
The period of expectation was now doubled.	215.65099284312817
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."
	284.5493144175131
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	191.13926392263767
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country.	208.28349240459127
Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	137.27016551872867
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	128.4878656125453
Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	122.22466108371596
Good bye."
	210.21672043550538
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr.	273.4890253305033
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
	185.14570603699477
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together.	264.2054547576873
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.	579.0483956625297
Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	209.48988521435848
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	216.95314873607487
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	262.5985698768452
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.	199.25263404784639
This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."
	108.42557696664528
letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
	194.60375309393729
how can it affect them?"
	143.08428944780604
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
	169.58902126792543
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."
	174.29604669302196
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	254.60488124198082
But I must write no more.	209.83475363200733
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	213.11384784018105
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	201.50946786475464
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr.	166.16106658703254
Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."
	219.6894501385781
This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	145.90494980183752
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr.	270.975409242852
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	183.6655396311476
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	187.82540777806813
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	179.8869757138827
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	275.5203755226557
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs.	258.19021848199924
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	314.2288490161128
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	96.61180808578543
She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	153.84000350078426
Bingley, was incomprehensible.	145.8362378517556
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	290.58396640307933
He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."
	141.48947775168088
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,
	188.0058656041677
Does your
charge give you much trouble?	181.24050000673998
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
	104.73852751574279
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	177.19818496225284
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	241.31079245513038
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	242.91472759054506
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	345.54688156049576
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	232.16469380406605
We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	264.8982169205274
"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."
	235.57148942559252
He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	140.9827506020474
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	234.79642877530208
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	103.94148569573193
Why must their
marriage be private?	154.49836486524197
Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	176.44041962978292
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	190.40390304134817
Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	135.30928449456653
Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	158.4495252655603
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
	307.24304649885454
The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--Do you draw?"
	230.24670162041656
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	164.6831050596984
I am so
pleased--so happy.	138.5313278187039
Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	126.47183279580511
Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	237.87436069975456
"Indeed, Mr.	227.5647962113789
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	156.6146053675806
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.	504.6677972887444
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.	231.725506135621
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	104.00623886970708
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr.	170.36738720643572
For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	176.31530882682924
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	209.56962610548416
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"
	259.9868428052075
A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr.	161.61992243682806
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	185.21971267314177
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	164.61156302844125
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	139.48687860001178
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
	194.27119670441957
have been all round the park.	119.04315474210509
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr.	110.7239156671958
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	209.65855332217757
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	191.45925544635978
Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."
	171.68166491252725
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
	163.903417845951
But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied."
	205.069978558618
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.	271.71344925089545
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	163.52731393884136
And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	200.06715765748905
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	161.3838992383244
But now it comes out."
	145.90449716652836
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	298.4703911089117
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	126.8030703861944
"Does that young lady know Mr.	178.67578024140857
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	216.48155926935996
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
	180.91164160581525
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	204.24244159933275
How he lived I know not.	187.1650848928122
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr.	244.6317364122503
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	187.14820514242032
After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
	169.2473685559785
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.	159.97147089290462
Their reception at home was most kind.	173.18022490946902
From his garden, Mr.	251.4910999671456
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better.	214.51404251845693
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world.	230.97583933581572
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	185.23184856327762
demand it of your justice.	81.02925509290452
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	277.34926620128573
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.	195.77003841691658
When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."
	192.96422129983551
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	253.2670282544833
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr.	216.0497001464729
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	180.03143530231037
You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	182.78093120408286
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	115.74699834448825
Bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	230.57325947597482
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr.	431.0361959286626
If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	141.31748979003038
They met several times,
	316.5239958496221
I knew you would be wishing me joy."
	169.3427902081164
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs.	278.5837276174711
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."
	173.76772645102025

	1657.194553926089
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	216.07108404046963
*** START: FULL LICENSE ***
	532.9036398671572
Let us hope for
better things.	176.92997292973348
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	183.87751975013995
"And what is fifty miles of good road?	199.2082563959689
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
	124.4420169832574
Wickham was to
	27.858684365182945
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."
	213.0567723166228
acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
	424.44960135958485
I should never be happy without
	122.32311400333148
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable.	244.83591062496257
"Your's sincerely, &c."
	236.60431617831995
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	187.80596270220613
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	117.21085172125599
concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
	122.89429377821034
Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	178.2076870587497
Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	211.4019814810482
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	229.60029176573292
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede.	271.14366679897176
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	204.99824893587873
CHAPTER XVII.	227.5647962113789
"No--why should he?	100.91636706097187
restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	146.0672281229163
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,
	283.7866602500023
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	160.98066103673952
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"
	138.76818902440226
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	161.51279044910586
This was agreed to, and Mrs.	114.59729383608288
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	150.96582794423657
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	174.55354553410112
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr.	176.12959412676108
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	81.58559677550635
"I hope Mr.	252.0380503638479
It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr.	208.3194884645323
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	174.95512539459423
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
	216.97326033974082
"Dear Lizzy!"
	227.5647962113789
"He
only told me, what I have now told you."
	176.56759411872355
I see the imprudence
of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr.	278.1835421827845
Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	200.45561339385085
There was also a postscript to this
effect.	141.94884162955603
Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	136.35095590076574
Bingley is
come.--He is, indeed.	184.92978527866552
Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	220.7935628067336
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."
	212.56380939993545
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"
	101.78754186698418
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	216.3813485622425
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	289.369856006804
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	193.89847678865624
Forster,
the delight of Mrs.	126.5799621898306
I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	207.59676655797475
When Mrs.	227.5647962113789
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other.	416.9090179095061
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.	204.10846146131135
Bennet, alarmed.	190.28039285548894
oh! no."
	44.83845562904123
CHAPTER XII.	227.5647962113789
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it

How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
