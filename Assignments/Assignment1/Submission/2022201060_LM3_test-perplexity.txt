Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,
the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s
dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	2082.2738081547586
Straw hat in sunlight.	1196.2727718171657

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he
prayed and they all with him prayed:

His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	2021.9282944488261

They were there
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins.	1702.3279497791002

Short little finger.	946.4203558902273
Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips.	1426.1081059335756
Then
walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
there a word.	1253.4608098647095
They wheeled lower.	946.4336915828404
BLOOM: Molly!
	592.3640888758189
Sees me, does she?	1196.2854140044617
Like
that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	1837.0342343519014
I told her to pitch her voice
against that corner.	1531.6845737842589
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	1836.997410777477

STEPHEN: Thursday.	592.3640888758189
In cups of rocks it
slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	1911.3573325345692
All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.	1700.0678893036218
After supper

Dislike carrying bottles like that hag
this morning.	1276.1291937047251
says Joe.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: _(Enthusiastically.)_ A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on
Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness
scab.	1194.0011464425181
—Yes, sir, she said.	391.8983948199191
Perhaps it was
an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	1215.326243428285
That fellow spoke.	946.4336915828404
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
your other eye.	1045.2747274560766
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.	1512.1352658891194
Penitent thief.	592.3640888758189
Join on right here.	1196.2938425462191
Still it was a kind of language between us.	839.1286115027796
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the

sat down to wait.	1082.3420538571022
Ellis’s _Three Trips to Madagascar_ (brown cloth, title obliterated).	903.1061946775129
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	1194.6609644645334

beside her.	1616.7902595688165
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.	748.7446918629449
Where is my hat, by the way?	868.7960144536087
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	789.5245847718791
_Sweetheart, goodbye!_

Just a bite or two.	1040.6103468899387

Fintan and
S.	592.3640888758189
It is now a month since dear Henry fled
	1106.39990601914
Music they wanted.	946.4292464214541
Lovely air.	592.3640888758189
They were about him here
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
it to melt in their stomachs.	1823.8907052227778
—What’s the damage?	1196.1151489379445
Cremation better.	592.3640888758189
Act speech.	592.3640888758189
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to
him.	1184.5120680725847
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	1376.861144421135
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s
shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	972.8492478541459
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.	983.7354653714547
Regular world in itself.	1196.26855684203
And there’s the man now that’ll

What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	1512.138816961438
Broke his glasses?	946.4215135713408
And the old

Wants to sew on buttons for me.	1145.5372085477159
STEPHEN: Did I?	592.3640888758189

The shape is there still.	1020.3307516090426
Feel fresh then all the day.	793.564981039721
She asked him was that so.	847.011077733041
Stupefies them first.	946.4292464214541
O’Molloy said.	592.3640888758189
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	1512.0706936269426
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in

Dedalus’ (Div.	592.3640888758189

He passed the _Irish Times_.	592.3640888758189
She
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	1700.0678893036238
Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned.	1376.8650244983396
Hope the rain mucks them up on her.	1073.1205976006781
Have you seen him lately?	1376.8378633198702
The glint of my eye does it with
these breastsparklers.	1569.9882020902066
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	1237.0932839237369
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.	1173.442728355225
The bold blue eyes stared
about them and the harsh voice asked:
	1484.4444251734726
Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	1089.5731292826233
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	1870.9443871260023
_Peau d’Espagne_.	592.3640888758189
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but
she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	2188.413737506775
_Boom_ (as it incorrectly stated) and the
line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C.	1568.5154082830431
And all came
with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,
forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	2329.2248441126126
Heigho, heigho,
	592.3640888758189
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.	748.7527617590948
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	1189.3827800838058
He drank a draught of
cooler tea to wash down his meal.	1738.0619199000528
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	822.5560693485747
Palpably he was one of his
hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one
preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put
it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street
chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the
option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	1456.5211340412463
BLOOM: _(With feeling.)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor
mamma.	1253.6714350789334
Man all tattered and torn that married a maiden all
forlorn.	1871.0750922723994
He held the page from him: interesting:
read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
rustling.	2003.0644417561011
says Joe.	592.3640888758189
Where did you
launch it from?	1512.0813430695705
Who can say?	946.4248011905848
_Our lovely land_.	946.4336915828404
Long John is backing him, they say.	937.118642361389
On the whole though favouring
preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	1458.0790963580162
Getting up in a
minute.	533.5482540372569
he boomed.	1668.1208761605692
They mistrust
what you tell them.	1512.0789107725966
Full throb.	592.3640888758189
He took a cigarette from the open case.	1009.1664848923249
So a fellow coming in late
can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	2047.617615104843
_Bless me and let me
go._
	1305.2274618526733
The turnstile.	592.3640888758189
As I
am.	592.3640888758189
Say, thank you, mistress.	822.5831147706035
Who writes?	592.3640888758189
Say he got ten per cent off.	1616.7730681444202
If he doesn’t conduct himself
I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	1148.6900572129218
The
gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.	1462.3582212656768
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the
piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	1668.165962815617
Yes, yes: a woman too.	1185.2834399847507
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	592.3640888758189
BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other
ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I
admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though
it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a
thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.	1717.0892324930815
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	1511.944794765905
Why
hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian
of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	1633.3182356018888
STEPHEN: _Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti._ Queens lay with prize bulls.	979.3457205562845
By

Huguenot name I expect that.	784.6746171349943
—Is that he?	946.7569750939598
says he.	202.33180754613653
For instance who?	946.4336915828404
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
maraschino, thoughtful all two.	1959.196289341122

Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	1733.3127759217853
Just a chance.	647.1812560548422
Way he looked that.	1196.2261427952703
—Decree _nisi,_ says J.	784.6746171349943

You look like a fellow that had

—Has still, Ned Lambert said.	592.3640888758189

sounds.	959.7171219381264
Agenbite of inwit.	647.1873352442567
Self
which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become.	1767.774966507532
As a philosopher
he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
infinitesimal part of any person’s desires has been realised.	1840.1879325060888
Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears.	1870.8102363654473

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	1314.789536495521
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	1323.4849911716758
BELLO: _(Shouts.)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That’s the
best bit of news I heard these six weeks.	1030.5759662316696
There would be a fall and the greatest
fall in history.	1459.5504680854272
The young
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	1914.8956002975128
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	841.8114424048898
—Are you not coming in?	1376.8196878962872
Brown, Robinson and Co.	592.3640888758189

They wouldn’t play...	1196.2640851364329
—Your son and heir.	1196.2769856934065
Well, what are you gaping at?	959.7259802096014
An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the
lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of
appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean
Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	1326.701995785925
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
moment refusing to dictate further.	1398.8599937441618
My heart’s broke eating dripping.	1512.1352658891174
Bad as a
bloater.	1195.9584048269255
—I see, he said again with new pleasure.	1342.7831735660586
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
applied, rather than towards pure, science?	1634.9401623142323
Dead March from _Saul._
He’s as bad as old Antonio.	630.0536726395815
Douce Lydia.	592.3640888758189
He flung the pages down.	1376.8543947173234
Puking
overboard to feed the herrings.	1334.6300956903033
Sitting at home
after pig’s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair.	1590.5926423479268
A chasm opens with a
noiseless yawn.	1616.0461193587737
There’s a committee formed.	1376.6704661130716
A young white heifer.	1196.3022706333559
_Leah_ tonight.	592.3640888758189
—Don’t you know he’s dead?	671.7812176169335
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
drop in the way of drink.	1467.2552774078897
And therefore he left out her name
From the first draft but he did not leave out
The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
And in London.	1254.7823435540677
If you so condescend
	1196.281199670174
Were you brushing the cobwebs off a
few quims?	1767.690050834485
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the
world.	1706.0996429913796
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but
today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	2098.968075721457
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in

commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive
Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives in
sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock,_
billets doux _in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers
of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes’ Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days’
indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes,
season tickets available for all tramlines, coupons of the royal and
privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of
the World’s Twelve Worst Books: Froggy And Fritz (politic), Care of the
Baby (infantilic), 50 Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?	1272.8755885571707
A long and seafed
silent rut.	1512.1104065949905
Too much fat
on the parsnips.	1511.778359787624
He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	1775.3884318759067
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	1686.6701403267143
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	1618.7717729452459
Insure against
street accident too.	1376.8650244983396
_(He laughs.)_ Hu hu hu hu
hu!
	734.6005192660315
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	1130.466307430569
Veribest (Boot Blacking).	592.3640888758189
Travels beyond the sea and
marry money.	1035.5061994799303
The
motion is ended.	1196.3022706333559
Bred in the bone.	634.2775161759145
A like fate awaits him and the two rages
commingle in a whirlpool.	1490.1327732725165
says Joe.	592.3640888758189
—But Ann Hathaway?	592.3640888758189
Mr Magee, sir, there’s a
gentleman to see you.	699.5594890089075
Strange
feeling it would be.	731.6532383659097
Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and
skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling
from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and
lemon or currant sauce.	1944.6641259144455
Hell’s
delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	811.8813364137097
I’ll tell
him...	633.9535991628198
Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee.	1188.4133153642872
Torn envelope.	592.3640888758189
Still no-one can give what
he hasn’t got.	1570.0346574222235
BELLO: _(With wicked glee.)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you
took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on
the smoothworn throne.	1362.516772077442
Quite right to close it.	1376.8117113931753
He stopped.	592.3640888758189
Who could count them?	1196.3022706333559
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a
new dog so he ought.	1084.3527477681073
Dignam
dead?	592.3640888758189
_(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s
vulva.)_ There’s fine depth for you! What, boys?	1084.6720113517217
He
waits while you wait.	507.5061407597678
Took off her hat to show her hair.	1222.358065491788
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
his shirt four times a day, they say.	1169.1379452859803
Wellcut frockcoat.	592.3640888758189
And he
said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
them that were there.	1674.760359706453
Ways of the world.	267.22317764371184
He’s bringing the programme.	1096.1136280334483
Been walking in
muck somewhere.	1376.8495037818602
_(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare’s
beardless face.	748.7545201171399
Knows how to tell a story too.	1616.793824891658
—A hard one, sir.	1196.3022706333559
Were there testimonials?	946.4336915828404
In wild
attitudes they spring from the brink.	1699.567714314907
Out of a flying machine.	1375.9328024135464
He knows them all, faith.	1185.2623872743281

0—0—3
	592.3640888758189
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
fed on those oilcakes.	1905.3765051517673
Iron nerves.	592.3640888758189
On his annual bend,
M’Coy said.	724.1084873131331
From Six
Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with
knotty sticks, hayforks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with
stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey
negroes waving torches.	1584.6786142566418
Think that pugnosed driver did it
out of spite.	1330.9934435332218
CUNTY KATE: The brave and the fair.	1081.4862416868577
Glad to get away from other
chap’s wife.	1767.7670779007685
Tupper, wealthy Chicago
contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.	1322.6525155481006
And old.	592.3640888758189
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.	394.2307041882751
When for Irelandear.	592.3640888758189
Not, he
parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily
embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of
time.	1786.87421462208
Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth
fifty thousand pounds.	1323.104518852106
And would he not
accept to die like the rest and pass away?	1501.641514627037
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
delegation that an heir had been born.	1895.5550987074053
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	1956.5843580013247
It’s the white of the eye brings that out not
so much the pupil.	1456.5419270769537
Those races are on today.	1185.2831106086862
The crone
makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp.	1692.165379992869
He looked upon you to lust after you.	1700.0146684347565
At rest relatively to themselves and to each other.	1333.0339822998185
CRAB (a bushranger)
	946.4336915828404
Stephen filled again the three cups.	1512.0995191661432
Cows in Connacht have long horns.	946.4336915828393
His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	1823.2427720439714
So on.	592.3640888758189
Try the house opposite.	1196.3687574164435
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	1767.7688841065128
ZOE: _(Turns.)_ Ask my ballocks that I haven’t got.	742.9999488473949
—Gold cup, says he.	535.4331908093715
These heavy sands are language tide and wind
have silted here.	1871.079885776621
—Scutter! he cried thickly.	1196.284177255564
See the
wide world.	745.9491884705825
The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	1823.842595272646
—Ahem! he said very softly.	1096.5588260637749
—A nation?	592.3640888758189
Long John.	592.3640888758189
He dwelt,
being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in
general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as
works of art, in the National Museum.	1560.940408344456
Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair?	1767.7066668750972
O’Molloy said eagerly.	565.3243438224622
Afternoon she said.	340.8125412465234
_(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend_ Wet
Dream _and a phallic design._) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted
carriagepane at Kingstown.	1137.2136713775835
Your name on the altarlist.	1184.9374879728027
All fell to praising of it, each after his own
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that
another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed
in every household.	1931.1196332306386
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
Martin Cunningham there.	852.6316565901931
Section 4.	592.3640888758189
—Boody! For shame!
	592.3640888758189
